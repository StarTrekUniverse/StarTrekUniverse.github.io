1
00:00:08,382 --> 00:00:10,579
所有观测站，读取最终读数
All observation stations, take final readings.

2
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:11,944
这是我们最后一次绕轨运行
This is our last orbit.

3
00:00:21,185 --> 00:00:23,361
史波克，有回应吗？
Spock. Any answers?

4
00:00:24,374 --> 00:00:28,816
我还是在星球表面读到了碳循环生命体的迹象，舰长
I still read a suggestion of carbon-cycle life forms on the planet surface, Captain.

5
00:00:29,217 --> 00:00:31,852
以那里的条件，在科学上是不可能的
Which is scientifically impossible under conditions there.

6
00:00:32,475 --> 00:00:33,099
同意
Agreed.

7
00:00:33,998 --> 00:00:37,451
苏鲁先生，切换到我正在观察的星球区域
Mr. Sulu, switch to the planet area I have under observation.

8
00:00:38,169 --> 00:00:39,641
正在读取，史波克先生
I'm reading it now, Mr. Spock.

9
00:00:40,152 --> 00:00:45,094
似乎表明人工能量正以系数7的数量产生
It seems to indicate artificial power being generated in factor 7 quantities.

10
00:00:45,411 --> 00:00:48,227
这表明那里有相当可观的文明
Which would indicate a considerable civilization there.

11
00:00:48,953 --> 00:00:52,345
你在说什么星球上有生命体的胡话，史波克？
What's all this poppycock about life forms on this planet, Spock?

12
00:00:52,991 --> 00:00:54,366
表面是熔岩
The surface is molten lava.

13
00:00:54,407 --> 00:00:55,871
大气有毒
The atmosphere is poisonous.

14
00:00:56,119 --> 00:00:58,102
我们的读数可能有误，舰长
Our readings could be false, Captain,

15
00:00:58,276 --> 00:01:00,351
也许是由某些自然现象引起
perhaps caused by some natural phenomena.

16
00:01:00,872 --> 00:01:03,831
我想星际舰队应该忘记那些老旧的太空传奇
I think Starfleet should forget about those old space legends.

17
00:01:03,857 --> 00:01:05,462
这里没有智慧生命
There's no intelligent life here.

18
00:01:08,033 --> 00:01:10,205
上尉，有没有来自星球的消息？
Lieutenant, anything from the planet?

19
00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:13,085
我反复尝试了每一个呼叫频率，长官
I repeatedly tried on every hailing frequency, sir.

20
00:01:13,767 --> 00:01:15,303
所有频道都没有回应
There's no response on any channel.

21
00:01:16,609 --> 00:01:20,895
将该星球的传感器读数和日志条目传给星际舰队
Transmit to Starfleet our sensor readings and log entries on the planet.

22
00:01:22,614 --> 00:01:26,749
地表条件使我们无法传送下去进行调查
Surface conditions make it impossible for us to beam down and investigate.

23
00:01:27,271 --> 00:01:29,944
因此我们将继续我们的下一个任务
We are therefore going on to our next assignment.

24
00:01:30,148 --> 00:01:31,339
正在完成最后一圈绕轨运行，长官
Completing final orbit, sir.

25
00:01:31,646 --> 00:01:32,709
准备以曲速脱离轨道
Prepare to warp us out.

26
00:01:34,866 --> 00:01:36,826
[引擎故障]
[ENGINES FAIL] 

27
00:01:37,035 --> 00:01:37,780
警报状态
Alert status.

28
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:39,767
我们正在被扫描，舰长
We're being scanned, Captain.

29
00:01:39,977 --> 00:01:41,817
深入的探测，令人难以置信地迅速
A deep probe, incredibly swift.

30
00:01:51,068 --> 00:01:51,708
吉姆
Jim.

31
00:02:15,836 --> 00:02:16,860
我想你是柯克舰长
Captain Kirk, I believe.

32
00:02:18,126 --> 00:02:19,930
很高兴认识你，长官
A pleasure to make your acquaintance, sir.

33
00:02:22,179 --> 00:02:22,710
乌乎拉…
Uhura...

34
00:02:22,736 --> 00:02:25,699
无需检查你的语音电报设备
No need to check your voice-telegraph device.

35
00:02:27,167 --> 00:02:28,675
我猜你认得出我吧？
Do I gather that you recognize me?

36
00:02:28,966 --> 00:02:31,235
我认识你看起来的样子
I recognize what you appear to be.

37
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:33,216
外表最具有欺骗性
And appearances can be most deceiving,

38
00:02:34,036 --> 00:02:35,784
但这次不是，詹姆斯·柯克
but not in this case, James Kirk.

39
00:02:36,428 --> 00:02:37,486
我是亚伯拉罕·林肯
I am Abraham Lincoln.

40
00:02:54,204 --> 00:02:56,419
[柯克]宇宙，最后的边疆
[KIRK] Space, the final frontier.

41
00:03:03,149 --> 00:03:06,285
这些是星舰企业号的航程
These are the voyages of the starship Enterprise.

42
00:03:07,452 --> 00:03:11,102
它的五年任务：探索未知的新世界
Its fiveyear mission: To explore strange new worlds,

43
00:03:11,551 --> 00:03:14,367
寻找新生命和新文明
to seek out new life and new civilizations,

44
00:03:15,553 --> 00:03:18,293
勇踏前人未至之境
to boldly go where no man has gone before.

45
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:22,433
星际旅行：原初
第三季第二十二集

46
00:03:52,302 --> 00:03:54,720
野蛮的帷幕
The Savage Curtain

47
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,099
史波克
Spock.

48
00:04:08,954 --> 00:04:09,722
真有趣
Fascinating.

49
00:04:10,229 --> 00:04:12,368
人们用各种方式描述我，史波克先生
I have been described in many ways, Mr. Spock,

50
00:04:12,884 --> 00:04:14,105
但从来没有用过这个词
but never with that word.

51
00:04:14,545 --> 00:04:16,124
我在请求你的分析，史波克
I was requesting your analysis, Spock.

52
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:19,485
他们确实扫描了我们和我们的船只，舰长
They did scan us and our vessel, Captain,

53
00:04:20,571 --> 00:04:24,219
并且无疑获得了足够的信息来呈现这种错觉
and doubtless obtained sufficient information to present this illusion.

54
00:04:24,573 --> 00:04:25,421
幻觉？
Illusion?

55
00:04:27,374 --> 00:04:29,614
舰长，你允许我登上你的船吗？
Captain, will you permit me to come aboard your vessel?

56
00:04:30,124 --> 00:04:32,876
毫无疑问，你有可以检查我真实性的设备
No doubt you have devices which can check my reality.

57
00:04:37,044 --> 00:04:41,268
我们很荣幸能邀请你上船，总统先生
We'd be... honored to have you aboard, Mr. President.

58
00:04:41,904 --> 00:04:45,360
你们还在用分钟来衡量时间吗？
Do you still measure time in minutes?

59
00:04:46,918 --> 00:04:48,702
我们可以转换成它，长官
We can convert to it, sir.

60
00:04:49,208 --> 00:04:53,430
那么你会位于我的正上方在…
Then you should be directly over my position in...

61
00:04:54,524 --> 00:04:55,191
那里
There.

62
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:58,457
正好十二分半
Exactly twelve and one half minutes,

63
00:04:59,246 --> 00:05:00,245
到那时，舰长
Until then, Captain.

64
00:05:19,251 --> 00:05:20,111
谢谢，穆尔尼先生
Thank you, Mr. Mulney.

65
00:05:25,655 --> 00:05:27,284
那里发生了一点变化，舰长
Small change occurring there, Captain.

66
00:05:34,967 --> 00:05:36,593
放大倍数4，舵手
Magnification 4, helm.

67
00:05:37,216 --> 00:05:38,048
是的，长官
Aye, aye, sir.

68
00:05:42,844 --> 00:05:45,634
面积约1000平方公里
An area of approximately 1000 square kilometers.

69
00:05:45,665 --> 00:05:47,554
它的测量结果完全类似于地球
It measures completely Earth-like.

70
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:50,091
完美的氮氧大气，长官
Perfect oxygen-nitrogen atmosphere, sir.

71
00:05:50,459 --> 00:05:52,008
他精确到了秒，长官
He called it to the second, sir.

72
00:05:52,089 --> 00:05:55,126
我们将恰好在十二分钟后到达其上方
We'll be over it in exactly 12 minutes now.

73
00:05:57,206 --> 00:06:00,423
警卫，立刻派警卫部队去传送室
Security, send a detachment to the transporter room immediately,

74
00:06:00,436 --> 00:06:01,657
随身携带相位枪
phaser side arms,

75
00:06:02,388 --> 00:06:04,864
并准备提供总统待遇
and be prepared to give presidential honors.

76
00:06:05,961 --> 00:06:08,608
吉姆，你真的相信他是亚伯拉罕·林肯吗？
Jim, do you really believe he's Abraham Lincoln?

77
00:06:08,721 --> 00:06:10,193
很明显他相信
It's obvious he believes it.

78
00:06:10,689 --> 00:06:14,770
哦，麦考伊医生，斯科特先生，穿全套制服
Oh, Dr. McCoy, Mr. Scott, full dress uniforms.

79
00:06:16,924 --> 00:06:19,280
全套制服？总统待遇？
Full dress? Presidential honors?

80
00:06:19,331 --> 00:06:21,248
你在说什么乱七八糟的，迪克森先生
What is this nonsense, Mr. Dickerson?

81
00:06:21,386 --> 00:06:23,625
我听说林肯总统要上船，长官
I understand President Lincoln's coming aboard, sir.

82
00:06:23,711 --> 00:06:25,345
哦，你真傻，小伙子
Oh, you're daft, man.

83
00:06:25,364 --> 00:06:27,348
舰长是这么跟我说的，长官
All I know, sir, is what the captain tells me,

84
00:06:27,575 --> 00:06:30,202
他说，谁要是敢笑，他就剥了谁的皮
and he says he'll have the hide of the first man who so much as smiles.

85
00:06:33,274 --> 00:06:36,264
我本以为船上的外科医生至少会保持理智！
I'd have expected sanity from the ship's surgeon, at least!

86
00:06:37,189 --> 00:06:39,109
确实是林肯总统
President Lincoln indeed.

87
00:06:39,775 --> 00:06:42,798
毫无疑问，紧随其后的是法国的路易和罗伯特一世
No doubt to be followed by Louis of France and Robert the Bruce.

88
00:06:42,883 --> 00:06:46,198
如果真是这样，我们将对每个人给出合适的待遇，斯科特先生
If so, we'll execute appropriate honors to each, Mr. Scott.

89
00:06:47,038 --> 00:06:47,609
是的，长官
Aye, sir.

90
00:06:47,646 --> 00:06:50,228
先生们，我一点也不相信
Gentlemen, I don't for a moment believe that

91
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:52,433
林肯总统真的会上船
President Lincoln is actually coming aboard,

92
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:56,662
但我们正在面对一种未知且看来高度先进的生命体
but we're dealing with an unknown and apparently highly advanced life form.

93
00:06:57,245 --> 00:06:58,175
在我们弄清楚前…
Until we know...

94
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,370
我们入乡随俗
when in Rome, we'll do as the Romans do.

95
00:07:02,883 --> 00:07:04,395
契科夫[对讲机]：舰桥呼叫传送室
CHEKOV [ON INTERCOM] : Bridge to transporter room.

96
00:07:04,901 --> 00:07:06,404
还有一分钟到达上空位置
One minute to overhead position.

97
00:07:07,467 --> 00:07:08,413
锁定了什么东西
Locked onto something.

98
00:07:09,951 --> 00:07:11,735
那看起来像人类吗，史波克先生？
Does that appear human to you, Mr. Spock?

99
00:07:12,161 --> 00:07:12,767
真有趣
Fascinating.

100
00:07:14,045 --> 00:07:16,360
某一瞬间，它看起来几乎是矿物
For a moment, it appeared almost mineral.

101
00:07:17,168 --> 00:07:19,408
像有沉重前爪的活的石头
Like living rock with heavy fore claws.

102
00:07:20,419 --> 00:07:22,867
现在已经稳定下来，完全是人的读数了
It's settling down now to completely human readings.

103
00:07:23,291 --> 00:07:25,787
我们现在可以随时将它传送到上船，长官
We can beam it aboard any time now, sir.

104
00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:29,721
麦考伊医生，记录三录仪读数
Dr. McCoy, take tricorder readings

105
00:07:30,058 --> 00:07:32,062
看看它是不是人类
and see if it is human.

106
00:07:33,881 --> 00:07:36,953
演奏鼓号齐鸣，史波克先生
Appropriate ruffles and flourishes, Mr. Spock.

107
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:39,345
警卫，做好准备
Security, stand ready.

108
00:07:40,022 --> 00:07:42,933
相位枪小队，准备好重度击晕
Phaser team, set ready for heavy stun.

109
00:07:47,252 --> 00:07:48,453
乐队荣誉准备就绪，舰长
Band honors ready, Captain.

110
00:07:49,843 --> 00:07:50,408
传送
Energize.

111
00:08:10,583 --> 00:08:13,906
[船员吹口哨]
[CREWMAN BLOWS WHISTLE] 

112
00:08:17,476 --> 00:08:19,722
[击鼓声和号声]
[DRUM ROLL AND FANFARE] 

113
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:23,774
联邦星舰企业号很荣幸能邀请你上船，总统先生
The USS Enterprise is honored to have you aboard, Mr. President.

114
00:08:27,945 --> 00:08:28,795
奇怪
Strange.

115
00:08:31,237 --> 00:08:32,408
演奏者们在哪里？
Where are the musicians?

116
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:34,488
那是录制的音乐，长官
That's taped music, sir.

117
00:08:35,336 --> 00:08:38,289
执行任务的星舰从不带仪仗队
A starship on active duty never carries an honor detachment.

118
00:08:38,704 --> 00:08:40,381
你说的是录制的音乐
Taped music, you say.

119
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:46,254
嗯，也许史波克先生稍后会好心地给我解释
Well, perhaps Mr. Spock will be good enough to explain that to me later.

120
00:08:47,685 --> 00:08:50,181
一种非常有趣的登船方式，舰长
A most interesting way to come aboard, Captain.

121
00:08:50,715 --> 00:08:52,438
使用的设备是什么？
What was the device used?

122
00:08:53,128 --> 00:08:54,920
一个能量-物质扰频器，长官
An energy-matter scrambler, sir.

123
00:08:55,315 --> 00:08:58,003
你体内的分子被转化为能量
The molecules in your body are converted into energy,

124
00:08:58,157 --> 00:09:01,951
然后传送到这间屋子里，并重新转化为原来的形式
then beamed into this chamber and reconverted back into their original pattern.

125
00:09:02,619 --> 00:09:05,298
好吧，既然我在这里…
Well, since I'm obviously here...

126
00:09:07,086 --> 00:09:08,144
而且很完整
and quite whole,

127
00:09:09,647 --> 00:09:12,207
不管你的意思是什么，显然很有效
whatever you mean apparently works very well indeed.

128
00:09:12,443 --> 00:09:16,225
先生们，如果这些是武器，请放下吧
Gentlemen, if those are weapons, please lower them.

129
00:09:16,843 --> 00:09:18,985
以我这个年纪，恐怕没有什么危险性
At my age, I'm afraid I'm not very dangerous.

130
00:09:20,298 --> 00:09:21,066
是人类，吉姆
Human, Jim.

131
00:09:22,782 --> 00:09:24,280
从里到外都是人类，麦考伊医生
All too human, Dr. McCoy.

132
00:09:24,765 --> 00:09:26,237
很高兴认识你，先生
Happy to make your acquaintance, sir.

133
00:09:28,665 --> 00:09:33,465
总统先生，请允许我介绍我的人员
Mr. President, may I present my officers.

134
00:09:34,476 --> 00:09:35,823
史波克中校，副指挥官
Commander Spock, second in command,

135
00:09:36,383 --> 00:09:39,647
轮机长斯科特和警卫官迪克森
Engineering Officer Scott and Security Officer Dickerson.

136
00:09:41,448 --> 00:09:44,974
史波克先生，斯科特先生，迪克森先生
Mr. Spock, Mr. Scott, Mr. Dickerson.

137
00:09:45,419 --> 00:09:47,315
先生们，我希望与你们每一个人交谈
Gentlemen, I hope to talk to each of you.

138
00:09:47,729 --> 00:09:51,051
但同时，你们的舰长被问题所困扰
But meanwhile, your captain is consumed with questions

139
00:09:51,529 --> 00:09:53,178
我将尽我所能地回答
and I shall do my utmost to answer them.

140
00:09:53,965 --> 00:09:57,827
我相信你们的职责会腾出时间来回答我的一些问题
And I trust your duties will permit time to answer some of mine.

141
00:09:58,110 --> 00:09:59,014
为您效劳，舰长
At your service, Captain.

142
00:10:00,905 --> 00:10:04,018
迪克森上尉，你和你的人可以回宿舍了
Lieutenant Dickerson, you and your men may return to quarters.

143
00:10:04,764 --> 00:10:05,546
总统先生
Mr. President.

144
00:10:06,609 --> 00:10:07,897
一艘非常有趣的船
A most interesting vessel.

145
00:10:19,137 --> 00:10:22,204
在你把他传送上船前，你锁定的是什么？
Just what was it you locked onto before you beamed him aboard?

146
00:10:22,525 --> 00:10:24,181
你听到了史波克先生说的
You heard Mr. Spock yourself.

147
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,830
他称之为矿物，就像活的石头
Mineral, he called it. Like living rock.

148
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:30,018
那变成了林肯？
And that became Lincoln?

149
00:10:30,519 --> 00:10:31,351
我说不清
I couldn't tell.

150
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:34,091
可能是另一个人在那里站着
May have been another figure down there standing by.

151
00:10:35,287 --> 00:10:35,991
你怎么看？
What do you make of it?

152
00:10:38,574 --> 00:10:39,641
我不太确定
I'm not quite sure.

153
00:10:48,101 --> 00:10:50,989
柯克：舰长日志，星历5906.4
KIRK: Captain's log, stardate 5906.4.

154
00:10:51,326 --> 00:10:54,060
我们传送了谁或是什么东西上了船？
Who or what has been beamed aboard our vessel?

155
00:10:54,863 --> 00:10:57,827
一个把自己变成这种形态的外星人？一个幻象？
An alien who has changed himself into this form? An illusion?

156
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:01,707
我无法想象亚伯拉罕·林肯
I cannot conceive it possible that Abraham Lincoln

157
00:11:01,717 --> 00:11:03,809
有可能真的转世了
could have actually been reincarnated.

158
00:11:03,894 --> 00:11:07,350
然而他的仁慈，他的温柔智慧，他的幽默
And yet his kindness, his gentle wisdom, his humor,

159
00:11:07,789 --> 00:11:09,915
关于他的一切都是那么真实
everything about him is so right.

160
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:19,406
如果我没记错，你们联邦军队的观测气球大约在600英尺高的地方
Yes, if I recall, your Union Army observation balloons were tendered 600 or so feet high.

161
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:23,372
我们在这个星球表面上方643英里处
We're 643 miles above the surface of this planet.

162
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:30,057
你们能把这么长的距离测量得那么精确吗？
You can measure great distances that closely?

163
00:11:30,502 --> 00:11:31,201
我们可以，长官
We do, sir.

164
00:11:33,799 --> 00:11:39,835
目前高度，643英里2,021英尺2.04英寸
643 miles, 2,021 feet, 2.04 inches, at this moment,

165
00:11:39,952 --> 00:11:41,488
使用你的旧式测量单位的话
using your old style measurements.

166
00:11:43,234 --> 00:11:43,810
保佑我
Bless me.

167
00:11:45,104 --> 00:11:46,512
打扰一下，柯克舰长
Excuse me, Captain Kirk.

168
00:11:46,949 --> 00:11:47,446
你说
Yes?

169
00:11:47,691 --> 00:11:48,544
斯科特先生…
Mr. Scott...

170
00:11:48,682 --> 00:11:49,955
多么迷人的黑人女性啊
What a charming Negress.

171
00:11:52,117 --> 00:11:53,853
哦，原谅我，亲爱的
Oh, forgive me, my dear.

172
00:11:54,677 --> 00:11:58,389
我知道在我那个时代，有些人用这个词来描述财产
I know in my time some used that term as a description of property.

173
00:11:58,863 --> 00:12:00,821
但我为什么要反对这个词呢，长官？
But why should I object to that term, sir?

174
00:12:02,283 --> 00:12:05,589
在我们这个世纪，我们已经学会了不惧怕语言
See in our century, we've learned not to fear words.

175
00:12:07,348 --> 00:12:09,622
请让我介绍我们的通讯官，乌乎拉上尉
May I present our communications officer, Lieutenant Uhura.

176
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:12,612
我那个世纪的愚昧
The foolishness of my century

177
00:12:13,087 --> 00:12:15,242
让我在没有冒犯的情况下道歉
had me apologizing where no offense was given.

178
00:12:15,561 --> 00:12:18,045
我们每个人都学会了以做自己为荣
We've each learned to be delighted with what we are.

179
00:12:19,665 --> 00:12:22,180
瓦肯人比我们早几个世纪就学会了
The Vulcans learned that centuries before we did.

180
00:12:22,916 --> 00:12:24,971
它是瓦肯哲学的基础，长官
It is basic to the Vulcan philosophy, sir.

181
00:12:25,683 --> 00:12:29,422
让存在变得有价值的一系列事物的组合
The combination of a number of things to make existence worthwhile.

182
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:30,301
是的
Yes,

183
00:12:31,027 --> 00:12:33,728
"诺姆"的哲学，意思是“全部”
Philosophy of "Nome," meaning all.

184
00:12:40,084 --> 00:12:41,009
我是怎么知道的？
How did I know that?

185
00:12:44,367 --> 00:12:47,924
就像我似乎知道在星球表面
Just as I seem to know that on the planet's surface,

186
00:12:48,788 --> 00:12:52,248
你将见到一位瓦肯人，他在你们星球历史上是最伟大的人物之一
you will meet one of the greatest living Vulcans in all the long history of your planet.

187
00:12:52,744 --> 00:12:54,374
我的脑子里想不起来他的名字
My mind cannot recall his name,

188
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:56,234
但我知道他会在那里
but I know he will be there.

189
00:13:02,169 --> 00:13:03,833
是什么给你的船提供动力，舰长？
What is it that powers your vessel, Captain?

190
00:13:04,392 --> 00:13:05,368
我可以看看你的轮机室吗？
May I see your engine room?

191
00:13:05,588 --> 00:13:07,428
当然，我们的轮机长…
Certainly. Our engineering officer...

192
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:10,766
已经在简报室等了你两个多小时了，长官
Has been waiting in the briefing room for you, sir, for over two hours.

193
00:13:11,374 --> 00:13:12,206
哦，天哪
Oh, dear.

194
00:13:13,934 --> 00:13:16,050
请原谅我，我们的通讯官…
If you'll forgive me, our communications officer...

195
00:13:16,071 --> 00:13:18,156
我很高兴让她当向导
I would be delighted to have her as a guide.

196
00:13:19,546 --> 00:13:20,185
再次原谅我
Forgive me again.

197
00:13:20,615 --> 00:13:21,722
我们很快就回来
We'll rejoin you shortly.

198
00:13:22,807 --> 00:13:23,634
他们到底在哪儿？
Where the devil are they?

199
00:13:24,049 --> 00:13:26,492
他们可能正在厨房里找一盘羊杂碎
They're probably looking up a plate of haggis in the galley.

200
00:13:26,492 --> 00:13:27,536
其他地方他们都去过了
They've been everywhere else.

201
00:13:27,857 --> 00:13:29,058
抱歉耽误了，先生们
Sorry to have been delayed, gentlemen.

202
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:33,362
吉姆，我是最后一个对你的指挥形象提出建议的…
Jim, I would be the last to advise you on your command image...

203
00:13:33,423 --> 00:13:34,762
我怀疑，老骨头，但请继续
I doubt that, Bones, but continue.

204
00:13:35,396 --> 00:13:36,920
一定要我明说吗？
Do I have to lay it out for you?

205
00:13:37,169 --> 00:13:41,739
几乎所有船员都看到你把这个骗子者当作真的对待
Practically the entire crew has seen you treat this impostor like the real thing...

206
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:43,594
然而他不可能是真的
when he can't possibly be the real article.

207
00:13:44,074 --> 00:13:47,850
三百年前林肯就死在了离这上百光年的一颗星球上
Lincoln died three centuries ago on a planet hundreds of light-years away.

208
00:13:48,153 --> 00:13:50,852
应该是那个方向，轮机长
More that direction, Engineer.

209
00:13:53,254 --> 00:13:55,053
你是科学官，你为何不
You're the science officer. Why aren't you,

210
00:13:55,671 --> 00:13:58,776
呃，在这个时候做些科学官们做的事？
well, doing whatever a science officer does at a time like this?

211
00:13:59,474 --> 00:14:01,861
我是，医生，我在观察外星人
I am, Doctor. I am observing the alien.

212
00:14:02,464 --> 00:14:04,794
终于，至少有人同意我们的看法了
At last. At least somebody agrees with us.

213
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:05,616
他是个外星人
He's an alien.

214
00:14:05,914 --> 00:14:07,048
他当然是个外星人
Yes, of course, he's an alien.

215
00:14:07,381 --> 00:14:08,735
他有潜在危险
He's potentially dangerous.

216
00:14:08,904 --> 00:14:11,528
疯了！和大角星犬鸟一样疯！
Mad! Loony as an Arcturian dog bird!

217
00:14:12,752 --> 00:14:18,629
先生们，如你们所知，史波克先生和我已被邀请
Gentlemen, as you know, Mr. Spock and I have been invited

218
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:21,232
和他一起传送到星球表面
to beam down to the planet's surface with him.

219
00:14:22,257 --> 00:14:23,025
有什么意见吗？
Any comments on that?

220
00:14:23,486 --> 00:14:24,510
是的，很大
Yes, a big one.

221
00:14:25,259 --> 00:14:27,114
突然间，奇迹般地
Suddenly, miraculously,

222
00:14:27,155 --> 00:14:30,506
我们看到那里有一小块类似地球的环境
we see a small spot of earth-type environment down there.

223
00:14:31,308 --> 00:14:34,978
它真的在那里还是只是我们认为我们看到它在那里？
Is it really there or do we just think we see it down there?

224
00:14:35,384 --> 00:14:38,008
你们可能会传送到熔岩的海洋里
You might beam down into a sea of molten lava.

225
00:14:38,691 --> 00:14:40,355
但他为什么只想杀我们两个？
But why would he want to kill only two of us?

226
00:14:41,328 --> 00:14:42,550
这不合逻辑
It would be illogical.

227
00:14:42,805 --> 00:14:46,706
有了这样的能力，他们可以很容易地骗我们摧毁整艘船
With such abilities, they could as easily trick us into destroying the entire vessel.

228
00:14:47,272 --> 00:14:48,862
史波克先生，你是在暗示
Are you implying, Mr. Spock,

229
00:14:49,123 --> 00:14:51,294
传送去那里可能是安全的吗？
that it's probably safe to beam down there?

230
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:53,063
不，我没有，医生
No, I'm not, Doctor.

231
00:14:53,646 --> 00:14:55,925
毫无疑问，他们希望我们去那里是有不可告人的目的
There's no doubt they want us down there for a hidden purpose.

232
00:14:56,063 --> 00:14:58,933
否则，他们就会为这一切提供一些合乎逻辑的理由
Otherwise, they would have revealed some logical reason for all of this.

233
00:15:00,096 --> 00:15:04,936
为什么是林肯，史波克？对此有什么猜测吗？
Why Lincoln, Spock? Any speculation on that?

234
00:15:06,153 --> 00:15:08,969
猜测是不必要的，舰长，答案很明显
Speculation is unnecessary, Captain. The answer is clear.

235
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:13,176
对你来说林肯总统一直是一个非常个人化的英雄
President Lincoln has always been a very personal hero to you.

236
00:15:13,773 --> 00:15:15,787
有什么能比让他活灵活现地出现在你面前
What better way to titillate your curiosity

237
00:15:16,324 --> 00:15:17,867
更能激起你的好奇心呢？
than to make him come alive for you.

238
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:20,980
不仅是我，史波克
And not only to me, Spock.

239
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:22,436
同意
Agreed.

240
00:15:22,774 --> 00:15:24,961
我也感受到了他的魅力
I, too, experienced his charm.

241
00:15:25,472 --> 00:15:27,393
这是一件令人印象深刻的复制品
It is a magnificent work of duplication.

242
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:30,701
但他与你有着特殊的关系，吉姆
But he holds a special involvement to you, Jim.

243
00:15:31,222 --> 00:15:32,321
而且我认为很有趣的是
And I think it's interesting,

244
00:15:32,459 --> 00:15:35,771
你是决定是否传送下去的人
in as much as you're the one who's going to make the decision whether to beam down or not.

245
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:40,900
别这么做，舰长
Don't do it, Captain.

246
00:15:53,501 --> 00:15:59,773
我们的星舰存在的意义就是与其他生命接触
The very reason for the existence of our starships is contact with other life.

247
00:16:01,306 --> 00:16:03,166
尽管我们无法理解这个方法
Although the method is beyond our comprehension,

248
00:16:03,171 --> 00:16:05,786
但有人给我们提供了接触的机会
we have been offered contact.

249
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:11,710
因此，我将传送下去
Therefore, I shall beam down.

250
00:16:12,223 --> 00:16:13,439
至于你，史波克先生…
Mr. Spock, as for you...

251
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:16,772
舰长，既然我被包括在邀请中
Captain, since I was included in the invitation,

252
00:16:17,053 --> 00:16:18,167
我必须和你一起传送下去
I must beam down with you.

253
00:16:18,467 --> 00:16:19,537
你俩都疯了！
You're both out of your heads!

254
00:16:19,599 --> 00:16:20,183
是的，长官
Aye, sir.

255
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:22,401
你是要违抗命令吗！
And you're on the edge of insubordination!

256
00:16:22,691 --> 00:16:25,616
我提醒舰长
Would I be on the edge of insubordination to remind the captain 

257
00:16:25,973 --> 00:16:27,921
发生在他身上的潜在伤害
this smells of something happening to him

258
00:16:28,215 --> 00:16:30,809
我可能无法挽救是违抗命令？
that I might not be able to patch back together again?

259
00:16:30,882 --> 00:16:31,482
是的！
Aye!

260
00:16:33,655 --> 00:16:35,749
先生们，我已记下并感谢你们的关心
Gentlemen, your concern is noted and appreciated.

261
00:16:36,379 --> 00:16:39,707
史波克先生，标准制服，三录仪和相位枪
Mr. Spock, standard dress, tricorders and phasers.

262
00:16:40,115 --> 00:16:42,749
我们将引导林肯总统去传送室
We will guide President Lincoln to the transporter room.

263
00:16:42,786 --> 00:16:44,644
我们会马上传送下去
We'll beam down immediately.

264
00:16:56,201 --> 00:16:57,263
待命，斯科特先生
Standing by, Mr. Scott.

265
00:16:58,108 --> 00:16:59,836
传送室呼叫舰桥，待命
Transporter room to bridge, standing by.

266
00:17:00,395 --> 00:17:02,699
契科夫[通过对讲机]：我们现在锁定在同步轨道上，斯科特先生
CHEKOV [OVER INTERCOM] :  We are now locked in synchronous orbit, Mr. Scott.

267
00:17:03,344 --> 00:17:06,778
传感器继续显示该地区在各方面都完全类似于地球
Sensors continue to show the area as completely Earth-like in all respects.

268
00:17:07,422 --> 00:17:10,809
如果他们错了，他们真的传送进了熔岩池…
If they are wrong and they do beam into a pool of lava...

269
00:17:11,891 --> 00:17:12,797
那他们就死了
Then they're dead men.

270
00:17:13,242 --> 00:17:14,719
我无法及时将它们拉回来
I couldn't pull them back in time.

271
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:22,716
好了，斯科特先生，传送
All right, Mr. Scott. Energize.

272
00:17:34,874 --> 00:17:35,450
斯科提！
Scotty!

273
00:18:00,887 --> 00:18:01,480
[史波克]舰长
[SPOCK] Captain.

274
00:18:03,909 --> 00:18:06,294
我们的相位枪和三录仪没有和我们一起传送下来
Our phasers and tricorder did not beam down with us.

275
00:18:10,688 --> 00:18:12,097
柯克呼叫企业号，企业号？
Kirk to Enterprise. Enterprise?

276
00:18:12,318 --> 00:18:13,363
企业号，请回答
Enterprise. Come in.

277
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:14,409
柯克呼叫企业号
Kirk to Enterprise.

278
00:18:15,711 --> 00:18:16,607
企业号，请回答
Enterprise, come in.

279
00:18:18,484 --> 00:18:21,359
没有坏，但有东西在影响它们工作
Undamaged, yet something is preventing them from functioning.

280
00:18:21,853 --> 00:18:23,581
请回答，登陆小队，报告
Come in, landing party. Report.

281
00:18:25,831 --> 00:18:27,207
企业号呼叫柯克舰长
Enterprise to Captain Kirk.

282
00:18:27,795 --> 00:18:28,448
你能听到我们吗？
Can you read us?

283
00:18:30,674 --> 00:18:32,466
如果他们没事，他们应该回复的
If they're all right, they should have reported in.

284
00:18:34,897 --> 00:18:35,791
你的解释，长官？
Your explanation, sir?

285
00:18:35,922 --> 00:18:36,840
我没有
I have none.

286
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:39,021
对我来说，这似乎是很正常的
To me this seems quite as it should be.

287
00:18:39,229 --> 00:18:40,532
为什么我们的武器会被拿走？
Why were our weapons taken?

288
00:18:40,532 --> 00:18:41,917
为什么我们不能和飞船通信？
Why can't we communicate with our ship?

289
00:18:42,174 --> 00:18:43,260
请相信我
Please, believe me.

290
00:18:43,636 --> 00:18:45,940
除了我告诉你的，我什么都不知道
I know nothing other than what I told you.

291
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:46,715
游戏结束了
The game's over.

292
00:18:47,242 --> 00:18:48,373
我们以礼相待
We've treated you with courtesy.

293
00:18:48,634 --> 00:18:50,642
我们已经顺着你的想法和你的身份走了
We've gone along with what and who you think you are.

294
00:18:50,823 --> 00:18:54,719
尽管有看似矛盾的地方，一切都如其所见
Despite the seeming contradictions, all is as it appears to be.

295
00:18:54,719 --> 00:18:56,736
我是亚伯拉罕·林肯
I am Abraham Lincoln.

296
00:18:57,447 --> 00:19:00,322
正如我看起来像谁
Just as I am whom I appear to be.

297
00:19:02,605 --> 00:19:03,309
苏拉克
Surak.

298
00:19:03,899 --> 00:19:04,421
谁？
Who?

299
00:19:06,129 --> 00:19:08,794
我们星球上有史以来最伟大的人，舰长
The greatest of all who ever lived on our planet, Captain.

300
00:19:09,886 --> 00:19:11,601
我们的一切的奠基者
The father of all we became.

301
00:19:12,414 --> 00:19:13,694
飞船所有的系统都停止运行了
All ship's systems going dead.

302
00:19:14,496 --> 00:19:15,521
切换到备用电源
Switch to reserve power.

303
00:19:16,052 --> 00:19:17,179
所有甲板，报告状态
All decks, report status.

304
00:19:17,408 --> 00:19:20,197
所有甲板，报告状态
All decks, report status.

305
00:19:21,239 --> 00:19:22,007
舰桥呼叫轮机部
Bridge to engineering.

306
00:19:22,235 --> 00:19:24,172
请回答，我们的动力怎么了？
Come in. What's happening to our power?

307
00:19:26,196 --> 00:19:27,732
舰桥呼叫轮机部，报告
Bridge to Engineering, report.

308
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:28,626
轮机手 [通过对讲机]：所有设备都罢工了
ENGINEER [OVER INTERCOM] : Everything's out.

309
00:19:29,145 --> 00:19:30,273
我们已经切换到备用电源
We've switched to reserve power.

310
00:19:30,574 --> 00:19:32,150
曲速引擎失去所有动力
Lost all power in the warp engines.

311
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:33,750
怎么样，苏鲁先生？
How is it, Mr. Sulu?

312
00:19:34,968 --> 00:19:36,867
目前还没不清楚是什么原因，他们正在待命
No answer yet on what caused it. They're standing by.

313
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:41,282
关闭所有不必要的系统
Shut down all but the most necessary systems.

314
00:19:41,804 --> 00:19:43,415
没有损坏报告，斯科特先生
No damage report, Mr. Scott.

315
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:45,286
没有发动机损坏的迹象，长官
No indication of engine damage, sir.

316
00:19:45,586 --> 00:19:46,582
启动重启周期
Engage restart cycle.

317
00:19:46,901 --> 00:19:47,493
不行
I can't.

318
00:19:48,947 --> 00:19:50,164
开始应急程序
Start emergency procedures.

319
00:19:50,421 --> 00:19:51,021
Aye, aye, sir.
是的，长官

320
00:19:53,463 --> 00:19:55,319
生生不息，繁荣昌盛，史波克
Live long and prosper, Spock.

321
00:19:56,138 --> 00:19:57,509
你也是，柯克舰长
May you also, Captain Kirk.

322
00:19:58,045 --> 00:20:00,157
你是苏拉克是不合逻辑的
It is not logical that you are Surak.

323
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:05,633
没有任何事实、对事实的推断或理论，可以使...
There is no fact, extrapolation of fact, or theory, which makes possible...

324
00:20:06,041 --> 00:20:09,288
不管我是什么，做出回应会伤害你吗？
Whatever I am, would it harm you to give response?

325
00:20:12,248 --> 00:20:14,878
生生不息，繁荣昌盛，苏拉克的形象
Live long and prosper, image of Surak,

326
00:20:15,903 --> 00:20:17,815
我们现在拥有的一切的奠基者
father of all we now hold true.

327
00:20:19,387 --> 00:20:24,953
苏拉克的形象从你的脸上读出了你的想法，史波克
The image of Surak read in your face what is in your mind, Spock.

328
00:20:25,447 --> 00:20:29,799
当我转过身来，眼睛看到你时，我流露出了情感
As I turned and my eyes beheld you, I displayed emotion.

329
00:20:30,886 --> 00:20:31,974
我请求原谅
I beg forgiveness.

330
00:20:33,921 --> 00:20:35,713
原因就更充分了
The cause was more than sufficient.

331
00:20:36,965 --> 00:20:38,371
我们不要再谈这个了
Let us speak no further of it.

332
00:20:40,206 --> 00:20:42,254
在我那个时代，我们不知道地球人
In my time, we knew not of Earthmen.

333
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:45,374
我很高兴看到我们有差异
I am pleased to see that we have differences.

334
00:20:46,062 --> 00:20:49,262
愿我们二人同心，其利断金
May we together become greater than the sum of both of us.

335
00:20:49,974 --> 00:20:52,008
史波克，我们别再和他玩这些猜谜游戏了
Spock, we'll not go along with these charades any longer.

336
00:21:00,828 --> 00:21:02,735
你很快就会有答案的，舰长
You will have an answer soon, Captain.

337
00:21:11,503 --> 00:21:13,247
我们的世界被称为埃斯卡比亚
Our world is called Excalbia.

338
00:21:14,377 --> 00:21:16,395
无数住在那个星球上的人都在观看
Countless who live on that planet are watching.

339
00:21:17,866 --> 00:21:19,381
好戏开始之前
Before this drama unfolds,

340
00:21:19,438 --> 00:21:22,773
我们欢迎柯克和史波克
we give welcome to the ones named Kirk and Spock.

341
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:28,859
我们对你们的世界或习俗一无所知
We know nothing of your world, or your customs.

342
00:21:29,941 --> 00:21:33,743
“好戏即将开始”是什​​么意思？
What do you mean "drama about to unfold"?

343
00:21:34,364 --> 00:21:35,936
你们是智慧生命体
You're intelligent life forms.

344
00:21:36,643 --> 00:21:39,203
我很惊讶你没有意识到我们给你的荣誉
I am surprised you do not perceive the honor we do you.

345
00:21:39,918 --> 00:21:44,574
我们不是我们星球上创造了一个与你们自己的世界相同的舞台吗？
Have we not created in this place on our planet a stage identical to your own world?

346
00:21:44,994 --> 00:21:48,706
我们认为我们是被邀请来这里的，我们是为了友谊而来
We perceive that we were invited here and we came in friendship

347
00:21:49,204 --> 00:21:53,696
你夺走了我们调查你们的世界
and you have deprived us of our instruments to examine your world,

348
00:21:54,333 --> 00:21:57,086
保卫我们自己，与我们的船只沟通的工具
to defend ourselves, to communicate with our vessel.

349
00:21:58,392 --> 00:21:59,992
你的意见已采纳
Your objection is well taken.

350
00:22:00,773 --> 00:22:02,162
我们将与你的船只沟通
We shall communicate with your vessel

351
00:22:02,162 --> 00:22:08,700
以便你们的同胞也能享受并从这出戏中获益
so that your fellow life forms may also enjoy and profit from the play.

352
00:22:09,819 --> 00:22:10,770
看吧
Behold.

353
00:22:28,383 --> 00:22:32,330
舰长，史波克先生，你可能通过历史知道其中一些
Captain, Mr. Spock, some of these you may know through history.

354
00:22:32,585 --> 00:22:34,185
比如，成吉思汗
Genghis Khan, for one.

355
00:22:34,946 --> 00:22:39,618
格林上校，在21世纪初在地球上领导了一场种族灭绝战争
And Colonel Green, who led a genocidal war early in the 21st century on Earth.

356
00:22:40,639 --> 00:22:45,572
佐拉，她在蒂伯龙上对被统治部落进行了身体化学实验
Zora, who experimented with the body chemistry of subject tribes on Tiburon.

357
00:22:46,213 --> 00:22:47,941
难忘的凯勒斯
Kahless the Unforgettable,

358
00:22:48,757 --> 00:22:51,829
为他的星球的暴政树立典范的克林贡人
the Klingon who set the pattern for his planet's tyrannies.

359
00:22:54,074 --> 00:22:58,874
我们欢迎企业号飞船来到我们的太阳系和我们的精彩表演
We welcome the vessel Enterprise to our solar system and to our spectacle.

360
00:22:59,673 --> 00:23:01,657
至少舰长和史波克是安全的
At least the captain and Spock are safe.

361
00:23:01,996 --> 00:23:03,720
这是某种形式的对抗
It's a confrontation of some sort.

362
00:23:04,610 --> 00:23:06,137
这些都是历史上的人物
Those are figures out of history.

363
00:23:06,729 --> 00:23:08,137
臭名昭著的恶人
Notoriously evil.

364
00:23:08,837 --> 00:23:10,393
我们请你与我们一起观察
We ask you to observe with us

365
00:23:10,827 --> 00:23:16,267
你称之为“善与恶”的两种对立哲学的对抗
the confrontation of the two opposing philosophies you term "good and evil".

366
00:23:17,633 --> 00:23:21,537
由于这是我们对地球人的第一次实验，我们的主题很简单
Since this is our first experiment with Earthlings, our theme's a simple one

367
00:23:22,546 --> 00:23:25,298
生存，生与死
survival, life and death.

368
00:23:26,572 --> 00:23:28,377
我们对你们的理念很陌生
Your philosophies are alien to us.

369
00:23:28,798 --> 00:23:32,628
我们希望了解它们，弄清楚哪个更强大
We wish to understand them and discover which is the stronger.

370
00:23:33,674 --> 00:23:36,467
我们通过观察这样的表演来学习
We learn by observing such spectacles.

371
00:23:37,092 --> 00:23:39,356
你说的“生存”是什么意思？
What do you mean "survival"?

372
00:23:40,065 --> 00:23:41,041
意思很明确
The word is explicit.

373
00:23:41,588 --> 00:23:44,486
如果你和史波克幸存下来，你们会返回你的船
If you and Spock survive, you return to your vessel.

374
00:23:45,598 --> 00:23:46,366
如果你们没有…
If you do not...

375
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:52,012
…你们就不存在了
...your existence is ended.

376
00:24:04,208 --> 00:24:06,193
我们可以把舰长和史波克传送回来吗？
Can we beam the captain and Spock back up?

377
00:24:06,915 --> 00:24:10,222
我们没有动力，传送回来的会是一堆死肉
We don't have the power. They'll come aboard a mass of dying flesh.

378
00:24:11,983 --> 00:24:13,665
我们可以把相位枪送下去吗？
Can we send the phasers down?

379
00:24:14,135 --> 00:24:15,736
我们无能为力，医生
There's nothing we can do, Doctor.

380
00:24:16,087 --> 00:24:17,015
只能看着他们
Nothing but watch them.

381
00:24:17,562 --> 00:24:20,506
他选了历史上最坏的几个人来对付他们
He's skimmed the worst ones in history to face them.

382
00:24:20,825 --> 00:24:22,115
但他们不是真的
But they're not real.

383
00:24:23,075 --> 00:24:25,699
不仅仅是林肯或苏拉克
Any more than that Lincoln or Surak.

384
00:24:29,866 --> 00:24:30,890
传感器读到什么？
What do the sensors read?

385
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:32,582
生命体
As life forms.

386
00:24:32,937 --> 00:24:34,217
他们是生物
They are living beings.

387
00:24:36,163 --> 00:24:38,211
他们会不会是外星人，投射出的幻象？
Could they be aliens, projecting an illusion?

388
00:24:38,826 --> 00:24:40,480
读数是类人生物的读数
The readings are those of humanoids.

389
00:24:41,835 --> 00:24:42,922
你为什么犹豫？
Why do you hesitate?

390
00:24:44,845 --> 00:24:46,637
你想要进一步说明吗？
Do you wish further clarification?

391
00:24:47,201 --> 00:24:50,337
你的行动选择是无限的，你选择的武器也是如此
Your choice of action is unlimited, as is your choice of weapons.

392
00:24:51,473 --> 00:24:52,543
如果你想用什么东西
Should you wish to use any,

393
00:24:52,543 --> 00:24:56,275
你可以用你周围能找到的东西制造出你想要的
you may fabricate anything you desire out of what you can find around you,

394
00:24:58,309 --> 00:24:58,961
舰长？
Captain?

395
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:09,421
史波克先生和我拒绝参加
Mr. Spock and I refuse to participate.

396
00:25:10,099 --> 00:25:12,019
你会做出其他决定的
You will decide otherwise.

397
00:25:33,192 --> 00:25:34,131
分析，史波克
Analysis, Spock.

398
00:25:35,712 --> 00:25:36,692
他们为什么想让我们打架？
Why do they want us to fight?

399
00:25:38,027 --> 00:25:40,122
也许就像他解释的，舰长
It may be exactly as explained, Captain.

400
00:25:40,894 --> 00:25:43,058
我们的善恶观念对他们来说很陌生
Our concept of good and evil is strange to them.

401
00:25:43,724 --> 00:25:45,900
也许他们想确定哪个最强
Perhaps they wish to determine which is strongest.

402
00:25:46,864 --> 00:25:48,912
如果杀死我们，他们就会得到答案
And they'll get their answers if it kills us.

403
00:25:53,174 --> 00:25:55,085
恐怕我们没人能离开，先生们
I'm afraid none of us may leave, gentlemen,

404
00:25:55,653 --> 00:25:57,772
除非我们按照它的要求做
until we do what it demands of us.

405
00:26:02,085 --> 00:26:02,926
柯克舰长
Captain Kirk,

406
00:26:04,616 --> 00:26:05,541
我可以和你谈谈吗？
may I speak with you?

407
00:26:07,585 --> 00:26:09,746
我非常同意你对这出戏的态度
I quite agree with your attitude toward this charade.

408
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:12,130
认为我们应该参与太可笑了
It's ridiculous to think we should take part in it.

409
00:26:13,609 --> 00:26:14,172
你想要什么？
What do you want?

410
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,888
和你一样，离开这里
The same thing as you do, to get out of here.

411
00:26:17,570 --> 00:26:20,066
我和你没有任何争执，就像你和我一样
I have no quarrel with you, any more than you have with me.

412
00:26:21,854 --> 00:26:26,276
你与历史对你的描述有些不同，格林上校
You're somewhat different than the way history paints you, Colonel Green.

413
00:26:26,889 --> 00:26:28,681
历史往往夸大其词
History tends to exaggerate.

414
00:26:29,993 --> 00:26:32,337
我建议我们立即叫停
I suggest we call a halt to this at once

415
00:26:33,276 --> 00:26:35,900
看看我们是否能找到摆脱困境的方法
and see if we can't find some way out of our difficulties.

416
00:26:36,494 --> 00:26:38,315
我的伙伴们完全同意我的看法
My associates are in full agreement with me.

417
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:45,062
舰长，你是被骗来这里的，是吗？
Captain, you were tricked into coming here, weren't you?

418
00:26:45,789 --> 00:26:47,005
我们也都是
So were we all.

419
00:26:50,007 --> 00:26:50,767
你从哪里来的？
Where do you come from?

420
00:26:53,254 --> 00:26:54,140
我不记得了
I can't remember.

421
00:26:56,255 --> 00:26:57,151
这不奇怪吗？
Isn't that strange?

422
00:26:57,876 --> 00:26:59,547
我的记忆力原来非常好
My memory used to be quite remarkable.

423
00:27:01,057 --> 00:27:05,345
嗯，不管在哪里，我都想回去
Well, wherever it was, I want to get back.

424
00:27:06,015 --> 00:27:07,273
所以在我看来，舰长
So it seems to me, Captain,

425
00:27:07,314 --> 00:27:08,968
我们有一个共同的想法
that we have a common cause,

426
00:27:09,858 --> 00:27:11,692
我们的敌人是那个生物
and our enemy is that creature.

427
00:27:13,578 --> 00:27:14,473
你有什么建议？
What do you propose?

428
00:27:15,285 --> 00:27:19,317
[格林]就是我们结合力量，推理出一些方法来战胜它
[Green] That we combine forces and reason some way to overcome it.

429
00:27:21,439 --> 00:27:23,677
格林上校，你臭名昭著
You were notorious, Colonel Green,

430
00:27:23,832 --> 00:27:27,197
是因为在与敌人谈判的过程中打击他们
for striking at your enemies in the midst of negotiating with them.

431
00:27:28,423 --> 00:27:31,815
但那是几个世纪以前的事了，舰长，而且并不完全是真的
But that was centuries ago, Captain, and not altogether true.

432
00:27:33,135 --> 00:27:35,565
不，如果可以的话，我现在想改变的地方很多
No, there's much I would change now, if I could.

433
00:27:37,178 --> 00:27:39,812
不要让偏见和谣言左右你
Don't let prejudice and rumor sway you.

434
00:27:43,242 --> 00:27:43,790
舰长！
Captain!

435
00:27:46,068 --> 00:27:47,103
我们如何警告他？
How can we warn him?

436
00:28:28,241 --> 00:28:28,881
有人受伤了吗？
Anyone hurt?

437
00:28:29,793 --> 00:28:31,949
我担心我的衣服有些破损
I fear my clothing is somewhat damaged,

438
00:28:32,513 --> 00:28:36,368
但以我的年龄还能摔跤是多么令人高兴
but how delightful to discover at my age that I can still wrestle.

439
00:28:36,935 --> 00:28:37,625
史波克先生？
Mr. Spock?

440
00:28:38,148 --> 00:28:38,895
我很好，舰长
I'm all right, Captain.

441
00:28:39,332 --> 00:28:42,150
但是，我建议我们为下一次攻击做好准备
However, I suggest that we prepare ourselves for another attack.

442
00:28:42,248 --> 00:28:44,404
不，我认为格林上校是对的
No. I think Colonel Green is right.

443
00:28:44,792 --> 00:28:46,618
那石头一样的东西是我们的敌人
That rock-like thing is our enemy,

444
00:28:46,863 --> 00:28:47,823
不是那些幻象
not those illusions.

445
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:51,334
作为幻象，刚刚那可是结结实实的一拳
For an illusion, my opponent carried a considerable punch.

446
00:28:53,050 --> 00:28:56,297
我忘了，你认为我也是幻象
I forgot. You consider me an illusion, too.

447
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,746
舰长说得很有道理
The captain speaks wisely.

448
00:28:59,485 --> 00:29:00,796
那四个人不是我们的敌人
Those four are not our enemy.

449
00:29:02,295 --> 00:29:04,562
我们应该共同达成一个和平的解决方案
We should arrive together at a peaceful settlement.

450
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:06,886
我很失望
I am disappointed.

451
00:29:08,437 --> 00:29:10,765
你毫不在意我们给你的荣誉
You display no interest in the honor we do you.

452
00:29:12,284 --> 00:29:14,588
我们为你提供成为我们老师的机会
We offer you an opportunity to become our teachers

453
00:29:14,946 --> 00:29:17,506
通过证明善与恶哪个更强大
by demonstrating whether good or evil is more powerful.

454
00:29:19,949 --> 00:29:22,358
你觉得我的体热令人痛苦吗，舰长？
You find my body heat distressing, Captain?

455
00:29:22,922 --> 00:29:24,596
你忘记了这个星球的本质
You forget the nature of this planet.

456
00:29:25,029 --> 00:29:28,805
我必须断定，你们需要一个战斗的理由
I must conclude that your species requires a cause to fight for.

457
00:29:29,293 --> 00:29:30,910
你现在可以与你的船进行通信
You may now communicate with your ship.

458
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:41,785
柯克呼叫企业号
Kirk to Enterprise.

459
00:29:42,177 --> 00:29:44,623
企业号，请回答
Enterprise, come in.

460
00:29:44,970 --> 00:29:46,595
[斯科特]斯科特呼叫轮机部，报告，上尉
[SCOTT] Scott to Engineering. Report, Lieutenant.

461
00:29:46,881 --> 00:29:48,274
[轮机手]紧急情况变严重，长官
[ENGINEER] Emergency increasing, sir.

462
00:29:48,588 --> 00:29:50,148
恶化刚刚开始， 长官
Deterioration has just started, sir.

463
00:29:50,479 --> 00:29:51,912
再说一遍，我听不见你说的
Give me that again, man. I cannot hear you.

464
00:29:52,321 --> 00:29:53,717
斯科特先生，我有舰长的消息
Mr. Scott, I have the captain.

465
00:29:54,297 --> 00:29:55,065
斯科提，你能听到我吗？
Scotty, do you read me?

466
00:29:56,061 --> 00:29:57,785
斯科特先生，我有舰长的消息
Mr. Scott, I have the captain.

467
00:29:58,103 --> 00:29:59,663
轮机部，检查辐射
Engineering, check for radiation.

468
00:30:00,108 --> 00:30:01,517
马上找个维修工去
Get a repair crew on it at once.

469
00:30:01,779 --> 00:30:03,865
已经找了，长官，似乎无法阻止
We have already, sir. We can't seem to stop it.

470
00:30:04,315 --> 00:30:05,507
有爆炸危险吗？
Is there a danger of detonation?

471
00:30:05,723 --> 00:30:07,003
估计四个小时，长官
Estimating four hours, sir.

472
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:09,811
红色警报，舰长，斯科特先生正在待命
Red Alert, Captain. Mr. Scott is standing by.

473
00:30:10,199 --> 00:30:11,159
[柯克]为什么拉红色警报？
[KIRK] What caused the red alert?

474
00:30:11,384 --> 00:30:12,543
我还不知道，长官
I don't know yet, sir.

475
00:30:12,678 --> 00:30:13,078
舰长
Captain.

476
00:30:13,491 --> 00:30:14,454
斯科提，快点把我们传送上去
Scotty, beam us up fast.

477
00:30:14,876 --> 00:30:15,504
我不能
I cannot.

478
00:30:15,827 --> 00:30:17,137
我们有动力故障
We have a power failure.

479
00:30:17,476 --> 00:30:19,076
我们现在只有应急电池供电
We're on emergency battery power only.

480
00:30:20,123 --> 00:30:20,699
发生了什么？
What happened?

481
00:30:21,262 --> 00:30:22,593
我无法解释，长官
I can't explain it, sir,

482
00:30:23,198 --> 00:30:26,220
但是物质和反物质在红色区域附近
but the matter and antimatter are in red zone proximity.

483
00:30:26,497 --> 00:30:27,114
是什么原因造成的？
What caused that?

484
00:30:27,861 --> 00:30:30,512
没有人知道，也没有人可以阻止
There's no knowing and there's no stopping it either.

485
00:30:31,373 --> 00:30:32,701
护盾正在失效
The shielding is breaking down.

486
00:30:32,729 --> 00:30:35,517
我估计还有四个小时完全失效
I estimate four hours before it goes completely.

487
00:30:38,573 --> 00:30:40,493
还有四个小时飞船就会爆炸
Four hours before the ship blows up.

488
00:30:43,865 --> 00:30:45,372
估计非常正确
The estimate is quite correct.

489
00:30:45,813 --> 00:30:48,692
你的飞船会在四个小时内把自己炸成碎片，舰长
Your ship will blow itself to bits within four hours, Captain,

490
00:30:49,783 --> 00:30:51,767
除非你在那之前打败其他人
unless you defeat the others before then.

491
00:30:52,507 --> 00:30:54,999
这个理由足以为之而战了吧？
Is that cause enough to fight for?

492
00:30:56,492 --> 00:30:57,485
如果他们打败了我们怎么办？
What if they defeat us?

493
00:30:58,020 --> 00:30:59,684
要拯救你的飞船和船员
To save your ship and your crew,

494
00:31:00,694 --> 00:31:01,589
你必须赢
you have to win.

495
00:31:04,545 --> 00:31:05,999
斯科提，通知星际舰队指挥部
Scotty, inform Starfleet Command.

496
00:31:06,391 --> 00:31:08,192
脱离引擎舱，如果可能的话，减少负重
Disengage nacelles, Jettison if possible.

497
00:31:08,454 --> 00:31:10,544
史波克先生，帮助他们，提供建议并进行分析
Mr. Spock, assist them. Advise and analyse.

498
00:31:11,582 --> 00:31:12,047
斯科提？
Scotty?

499
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:15,294
斯科提？
Scotty?

500
00:31:16,049 --> 00:31:18,597
你的通讯器失效了，舰长
Your communicators no longer function, Captain.

501
00:31:19,925 --> 00:31:22,065
你可以继续看表演
You may proceed with the spectacle.

502
00:31:23,081 --> 00:31:26,369
詹姆斯，战争是强加给我们的
James, the war is forced upon us.

503
00:31:27,978 --> 00:31:29,423
历史总是重演
History repeats itself.

504
00:31:39,167 --> 00:31:42,700
斯科特：补充日志，星历5906.5
SCOTT: Supplemental log, stardate 5906.5.

505
00:31:42,834 --> 00:31:44,016
轮机长斯科特报告
Engineer Scott reporting.

506
00:31:44,578 --> 00:31:47,094
企业号一定会在两小时内爆炸
The Enterprise is doomed to explode in two hours

507
00:31:47,126 --> 00:31:50,140
如果柯克舰长被这个星球上的敌人打败了
if Captain Kirk is defeated by the enemy on the surface of the planet.

508
00:31:51,165 --> 00:31:54,016
企业号的巨大力量已被化解
The enormous power of the Enterprise has been neutralised

509
00:31:54,355 --> 00:31:56,564
我们只能坐在这里看，无法提供帮助
and we sit here watching, unable to assist.

510
00:32:00,341 --> 00:32:01,350
你设下陷阱了吗？
Did you set the traps?

511
00:32:01,350 --> 00:32:01,803
是的
Yes.

512
00:32:02,661 --> 00:32:03,800
有什么发现吗？他们在干什么？
What did you find out? What are they doing?

513
00:32:04,041 --> 00:32:04,744
什么都没做
They've done nothing.

514
00:32:04,902 --> 00:32:07,876
他们没有武装自己，也没有准备任何防御
They've not armed themselves nor prepared for any kind of defence.

515
00:32:08,505 --> 00:32:10,150
要我说现在就攻击并解决他们
I say attack now and finish them.

516
00:32:10,457 --> 00:32:11,282
用什么？这些？
With what? These?

517
00:32:12,098 --> 00:32:13,114
比他们的好
Better than what they have.

518
00:32:13,544 --> 00:32:15,769
不，没有绝对的优势
No, it's not advantage enough.

519
00:32:16,544 --> 00:32:18,610
我想确保我们有胜算
I want to make sure the odds are in our favor.

520
00:32:19,208 --> 00:32:20,405
压倒和毁灭
Overwhelm and devastate,

521
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:22,125
这就是获得并保持权力的方式
that's the way to get power and to hold it,

522
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:23,685
正是我要做的
I mean to do that.

523
00:32:24,485 --> 00:32:27,661
与幻象作斗争并没有什么不道德的，史波克先生
There's nothing immoral about fighting an illusion, Mr. Spock.

524
00:32:28,561 --> 00:32:30,256
我们照他们的规则行动，战斗
We play their game, fight,

525
00:32:31,346 --> 00:32:32,930
要不然失去飞船和所有船员
or lose the ship and all the crewmen aboard.

526
00:32:33,097 --> 00:32:34,197
如果他们是真的呢，舰长？
And if they are real, Captain?

527
00:32:40,523 --> 00:32:46,208
我们把这里…作为据点
We'll use this... as a base.

528
00:32:47,824 --> 00:32:48,999
这是可防御的
It's defensible.

529
00:32:55,290 --> 00:32:56,787
他们一靠近就会被看到
They can't approach without being seen.

530
00:32:57,055 --> 00:32:58,945
我们是在打一场防御战吗，詹姆斯？
Are we fighting a defensive war, James?

531
00:32:58,945 --> 00:32:59,910
不，我们没有时间
No, we don't have time.

532
00:32:59,985 --> 00:33:02,896
但如果形势对我们不利，我想有个撤退的地方
But if things go against us, I want a place to retreat to.

533
00:33:03,464 --> 00:33:05,181
我现在要做的是侦察他们的情况
What I want to do now is scout them out,

534
00:33:05,694 --> 00:33:06,974
找到他们的弱点并发起进攻
find their weaknesses and attack.

535
00:33:08,688 --> 00:33:09,392
你喝威士忌吗？
You drink whiskey?

536
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:10,290
偶尔，为什么问？
Occasionally. Why?

537
00:33:10,718 --> 00:33:13,789
因为你的品质非常像一个我非常钦佩的人
Because you have qualities very much like those of another man I admire greatly.

538
00:33:14,096 --> 00:33:14,750
格兰特将军
General Grant.

539
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:15,129
谢谢
Thank you.

540
00:33:18,197 --> 00:33:18,837
谢谢你
Thank you.

541
00:33:20,138 --> 00:33:21,949
史波克先生，我们需要武器
Mr. Spock, we'll need weapons.

542
00:33:21,973 --> 00:33:24,779
我想古代瓦肯人制造过类似回旋镖的东西？
I believe the ancient Vulcans made something like a boomerang?

543
00:33:24,978 --> 00:33:25,667
是的，舰长
Yes, Captain.

544
00:33:26,313 --> 00:33:29,798
还有吊索和长矛，吊索…
And slings and spears. Slings...

545
00:33:30,497 --> 00:33:32,312
总统先生， 你小时候用过吊索
Mister President. You used a sling as a boy.

546
00:33:32,768 --> 00:33:33,996
我确实用过
Indeed I did.

547
00:33:35,089 --> 00:33:39,761
舰长，逻辑要求我们考虑另一条路线
Captain, logic dictates that we consider another course.

548
00:33:46,379 --> 00:33:47,467
我们没有太多时间，史波克
We don't have much time, Spock.

549
00:33:49,272 --> 00:33:53,228
我在瓦肯的时候，我们也面临过同样的选择
In my time on Vulcan, we also faced these same alternatives.

550
00:33:54,553 --> 00:33:58,014
我们遭受了毁灭性的战争，几乎摧毁了我们的星球
We'd suffered devastating wars, which nearly destroyed our planet.

551
00:33:58,378 --> 00:33:59,655
另一场战争也即将开始
Another was about to begin.

552
00:34:01,785 --> 00:34:02,617
我们左右为难
We were torn.

553
00:34:03,975 --> 00:34:06,712
但从我们的痛苦中，我们中的一些人找到了行动的方法
But out of our suffering, some of us found the discipline to act.

554
00:34:08,025 --> 00:34:11,436
我们派使者向我们的对手提出求和
We sent emissaries to our opponents to propose peace.

555
00:34:13,105 --> 00:34:14,027
先去的被杀了
The first were killed.

556
00:34:14,872 --> 00:34:15,687
但后来的人跟上他
But others followed.

557
00:34:17,274 --> 00:34:19,078
最终，我们实现了和平
Ultimately, we achieved peace,

558
00:34:19,905 --> 00:34:21,391
并一直持续至今
which has lasted since then.

559
00:34:22,410 --> 00:34:24,968
那时的情况不同了，苏拉克
Circumstances were different then, Surak.

560
00:34:26,526 --> 00:34:28,443
战争的面貌从未改变，舰长
The face of war has never changed, Captain.

561
00:34:29,778 --> 00:34:33,108
和解当然比杀戮更合乎逻辑
Surely it is more logical to heal than kill.

562
00:34:33,516 --> 00:34:36,780
但恐怕这种逻辑在这里不适用
I'm afraid that kind of logic doesn't apply here.

563
00:34:37,103 --> 00:34:39,991
这正是我们不应该战斗的原因
That is precisely why we should not fight.

564
00:34:40,316 --> 00:34:42,748
我的飞船危在旦夕
My ship is at stake.

565
00:34:51,946 --> 00:34:53,994
我不会伤害别人，舰长
I will not harm others, Captain.

566
00:34:55,334 --> 00:34:57,830
在这件事上他的的信念是非常深远的，舰长
His convictions are most profound in this matter, Captain.

567
00:34:58,150 --> 00:34:58,994
我的也是，史波克
So are mine, Spock.

568
00:34:59,713 --> 00:35:02,179
如果我相信有一条和平的出路…
If I believed that there was a peaceful way out of this ...

569
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:03,843
风险将由我一人承担
This risk will be mine alone.

570
00:35:04,989 --> 00:35:07,387
如果我失败了，你没有任何损失
If I fail, you lose nothing.

571
00:35:08,610 --> 00:35:09,940
毕竟，我不是战士
After all, I'm no warrior.

572
00:35:10,377 --> 00:35:13,285
舰长知道我以前曾和他并肩战斗
The captain knows that I have fought at his side before

573
00:35:13,969 --> 00:35:15,571
如果现在有需要我还会这么做
and will do so now, if need be.

574
00:35:16,595 --> 00:35:20,883
然而，我也是一个瓦肯人，为和平而生
However, I too, am a Vulcan, bred to peace.

575
00:35:21,541 --> 00:35:22,386
让他试试
Let him attempt it.

576
00:35:24,696 --> 00:35:26,313
你看到他们是多么奸诈了
You saw how treacherously they acted.

577
00:35:26,682 --> 00:35:27,473
是的
Oh, yes.

578
00:35:29,744 --> 00:35:35,821
但也许真正考验的是我们对和平的信念
But perhaps it's our belief in peace that is actually being tested.

579
00:35:43,039 --> 00:35:44,195
我没有权力管你
I have no authority over you.

580
00:35:44,675 --> 00:35:45,763
按你认为最好的方式做
You may do as you think best.

581
00:35:47,345 --> 00:35:47,921
谢谢你
Thank you.

582
00:35:50,898 --> 00:35:52,242
愿你生生不息，繁荣昌盛
May you live long and prosper.

583
00:35:59,310 --> 00:36:00,526
武器，长官们
The weapons, gentlemen.

584
00:36:04,538 --> 00:36:05,465
万一他失败了
In case he fails.

585
00:36:13,833 --> 00:36:14,391
上校
Colonel.

586
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:23,275
不！
No!

587
00:36:35,467 --> 00:36:36,627
让我们听听他怎么说
Let's hear what he has to say.

588
00:36:37,253 --> 00:36:38,355
他的话可能很有用
We may find it useful.

589
00:36:43,937 --> 00:36:44,869
停在那里，瓦肯人
Stop there, Vulcan.

590
00:36:46,379 --> 00:36:47,204
说明你的来意
State your purpose.

591
00:36:47,709 --> 00:36:50,160
我和平地来提议和平
I come in peace to propose peace.

592
00:36:50,806 --> 00:36:51,791
你投降了吗？
Are you surrendering?

593
00:36:52,534 --> 00:36:54,854
我这么做是为了大家好
I'm doing what I consider best for all of us.

594
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:58,604
如果你选择将其视为投降
If you choose to regard that as surrender,

595
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:00,543
我接受你的定义
I accept your definition.

596
00:37:01,664 --> 00:37:03,200
那些和平爱好者之一，上校
One of those peace lovers, Colonel.

597
00:37:04,475 --> 00:37:05,542
你为什么这么做？
Why are you doing this?

598
00:37:06,368 --> 00:37:07,584
你代表别人说话吗？
Do you speak for the others?

599
00:37:08,581 --> 00:37:10,949
不，我为自己说话，因为我厌恶暴力
No, I speak for myself because I abhor violence.

600
00:37:12,144 --> 00:37:14,843
但如果你接受我提供的解决方案，他们也会接受
But if you accept the solution I offer, they, too, will accept it.

601
00:37:16,178 --> 00:37:17,362
我怎么能确定？
How can I be sure?

602
00:37:18,376 --> 00:37:20,090
我认为你在试图欺骗我，瓦肯人
I think you're trying to trick me, Vulcan.

603
00:37:21,036 --> 00:37:23,094
我认为你在这里谈论和平时
I think that while you're here talking peace,

604
00:37:23,856 --> 00:37:25,352
其他人在准备进攻
the others are preparing to attack.

605
00:37:26,274 --> 00:37:29,220
不，上校，他们在据点，等待答复
No, Colonel. They are at their base, awaiting an answer.

606
00:37:29,846 --> 00:37:30,806
我怎么能相信呢？
How can I believe that?

607
00:37:32,230 --> 00:37:35,550
没有人会谈论和平，除非他用战争来支持和平
No one talks peace unless he's ready to back it up with war.

608
00:37:36,166 --> 00:37:38,482
他会谈论和平，如果这是唯一的生活方式
He talks peace if it's the only way to live.

609
00:37:39,239 --> 00:37:43,651
那么告诉我，如果我们接受，你能得到什么？
Then tell me, what do you have to gain if we accept?

610
00:37:44,301 --> 00:37:47,161
我所做的只是我所相信的知识
Nothing but the knowledge that I have done what I believe in.

611
00:37:47,471 --> 00:37:48,455
我能从中得到什么？
What do I get out of it?

612
00:37:50,393 --> 00:37:51,806
我为利益而战，瓦肯人
I fight for gain, Vulcan.

613
00:37:52,869 --> 00:37:54,043
我能在这里得到什么？
What do I gain here?

614
00:37:54,572 --> 00:37:56,679
你的生命和其他人的生命
Your life and the lives of the others.

615
00:38:02,615 --> 00:38:06,169
你自己说过，上校，我们的共同目标是生存
You said yourself, Colonel, that we have common cause to survive.

616
00:38:07,523 --> 00:38:08,566
我们一起就能做到
Together we can.

617
00:38:10,353 --> 00:38:11,427
而不是通过交战
But not by warring.

618
00:38:11,702 --> 00:38:12,527
我们为什么不杀了他？
Why don't we kill him?

619
00:38:12,639 --> 00:38:13,207
不
No.

620
00:38:14,124 --> 00:38:15,852
他是我们解决他们所有人的方法
He's our means to finish them all.

621
00:38:16,687 --> 00:38:19,887
上校，你肯定接受这样的逻辑？
Colonel, surely you accept the logic of this?

622
00:38:21,012 --> 00:38:21,755
你的答案是什么？
What is your answer?

623
00:38:22,531 --> 00:38:24,308
你很会说服人，瓦肯人
You're very persuasive, Vulcan.

624
00:38:25,638 --> 00:38:27,494
我想安然无恙地摆脱这种情况
I'd like to come out of this with a whole skin.

625
00:38:28,744 --> 00:38:30,909
也许我可以说服我的同伴
Perhaps I can convince my associates

626
00:38:32,016 --> 00:38:33,933
这对他们也有好处
that it would be to their advantage also.

627
00:38:55,427 --> 00:38:57,842
你的苏拉克是个勇敢的人
Your Surak is a brave man.

628
00:38:59,121 --> 00:39:00,611
和平的人通常是，舰长
Men of peace usually are, Captain.

629
00:39:02,290 --> 00:39:05,117
在瓦肯，他被尊为我们的文明之父
On Vulcan, he is revered as the father of our civilization.

630
00:39:06,712 --> 00:39:08,717
父亲的形象对我们来说意义重大
The father image holds much meaning for us.

631
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:12,678
你表现出情感，史波克
You show emotion, Spock.

632
00:39:15,566 --> 00:39:17,352
我非常尊重他所取得的成就
I deeply respect what he has accomplished.

633
00:39:17,503 --> 00:39:20,147
我希望他很快在这里取得一些成就
I hope he accomplishes something here, and soon.

634
00:39:20,192 --> 00:39:22,236
[尖叫]
[SCREAM] 

635
00:39:22,715 --> 00:39:23,528
苏拉克？
Surak?

636
00:39:27,788 --> 00:39:29,513
苏拉克：帮帮我，史波克！
SURAK: Help me, Spock!

637
00:39:36,734 --> 00:39:37,886
史波克，帮帮我！
Spock, help me!

638
00:39:38,661 --> 00:39:41,860
格林：史波克先生，你的朋友想要你
GREEN: Mr. Spock, your friend wants you.

639
00:39:42,583 --> 00:39:43,588
他好像受伤了
He seems to be hurt.

640
00:39:44,112 --> 00:39:44,903
史波克
Spock!

641
00:39:45,777 --> 00:39:46,928
帮帮我，史波克！
Help me, Spock!

642
00:39:47,602 --> 00:39:51,078
史波克！帮帮我！
Spock! Help me!

643
00:39:52,097 --> 00:39:53,829
格林：你不能让他受苦
GREEN: You can't let him suffer.

644
00:39:55,713 --> 00:39:58,058
他们试图煽动我们进攻，舰长
They're trying to goad us into attacking, Captain.

645
00:39:58,693 --> 00:40:00,276
他们希望我们贸然行动
They expect us to act rashly.

646
00:40:00,324 --> 00:40:01,242
是的，我知道
Yes, I know that.

647
00:40:01,659 --> 00:40:02,392
帮帮我，史波克！
Help me, Spock!

648
00:40:02,392 --> 00:40:04,122
You had no choice, Captain.
He was aware of what might happen when he went.

649
00:40:06,615 --> 00:40:07,829
我就不应该让他走
I should never have let him go.

650
00:40:08,304 --> 00:40:09,845
你别无选择，舰长
You had no choice, Captain.

651
00:40:10,634 --> 00:40:12,348
[尖叫]
[SCREAM] 

652
00:40:13,061 --> 00:40:14,149
你阻止不了他
You could not have stopped him.

653
00:40:14,852 --> 00:40:15,843
你怎么能无视呢？
How can you ignore that?

654
00:40:16,449 --> 00:40:17,852
瓦肯人不会这样喊叫
A Vulcan would not cry out so.

655
00:40:21,070 --> 00:40:23,852
不管他是不是瓦肯人，他都处于痛苦之中
Whether he's a Vulcan or not, he's in agony.

656
00:40:25,027 --> 00:40:27,046
我不是麻木不仁的，舰长
I am not insensitive to it, Captain.

657
00:40:27,623 --> 00:40:28,885
帮帮我，史波克！
Help me, Spock!

658
00:40:31,113 --> 00:40:33,737
但是你可以听着它而什么都不做
But you can just listen to it and do nothing.

659
00:40:36,778 --> 00:40:37,384
我不能
I can't.

660
00:40:38,481 --> 00:40:40,709
舰长，这就是他们想看到的
Captain, that is what they are waiting for.

661
00:40:41,438 --> 00:40:43,102
他们在等我们试着营救
They're waiting for us to attempt a rescue.

662
00:40:45,782 --> 00:40:47,500
我不能让他留在那里
I can't just let him stay there.

663
00:40:47,578 --> 00:40:50,951
也许我们可以救他，史波克先生
Perhaps we can rescue him, Mr. Spock.

664
00:40:52,107 --> 00:40:54,563
我建议我们按他们的想法去做
I suggest that we do whatever they want.

665
00:40:55,305 --> 00:40:56,585
按他们的想法做，长官？
Do what they want, sir?

666
00:40:57,174 --> 00:40:59,135
但不是以他们想要的方式
Not the way they want it, however.

667
00:41:00,276 --> 00:41:01,751
我们必须首先让他们相信
We must first convince them

668
00:41:02,348 --> 00:41:05,785
他们激怒了我们，使我们变得鲁莽
that they have provoked us to recklessness.

669
00:41:07,168 --> 00:41:10,240
詹姆士，我并不是要滥用你的威信
James, I do not mean to presume upon your authority.

670
00:41:11,348 --> 00:41:14,243
我的提议是我绕到他们的后方
What I propose is that I circle around to their rear,

671
00:41:14,741 --> 00:41:16,725
当你们两个提供正面攻击时
while you two provide a frontal assault.

672
00:41:17,304 --> 00:41:20,624
它应该足够暴力以掩护我的行动
It should be sufficiently violent to cover whatever I do.

673
00:41:21,162 --> 00:41:21,900
你会怎么做？
What will you do?

674
00:41:22,827 --> 00:41:24,378
我溜进他们的营地并释放他
I, slip into their camp and free him.

675
00:41:25,245 --> 00:41:25,847
不行
No.

676
00:41:26,293 --> 00:41:27,740
詹姆斯啊，詹姆斯
James, James.

677
00:41:28,769 --> 00:41:30,385
记着，我是个乡野村夫
Remember, I was something of a backwoodsman.

678
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,678
我怀疑你不能做我从小就做的事情
I doubt that you could do what I was bred to.

679
00:41:33,069 --> 00:41:34,783
我不能让你冒险，总统先生
I can't let you risk it, Mr. President.

680
00:41:35,198 --> 00:41:36,478
我已经不是总统了
I am no longer president.

681
00:41:37,626 --> 00:41:39,255
史波克先生，有什么意见吗？
Mr. Spock, any comment?

682
00:41:39,737 --> 00:41:41,065
帮帮我，史波克！
Help me, Spock!

683
00:41:42,939 --> 00:41:43,497
不，长官
No, sir.

684
00:41:43,698 --> 00:41:44,987
还有一件事，先生们
One matter further, gentlemen.

685
00:41:45,379 --> 00:41:47,185
我们要像他们一样战斗
We fight on their level.

686
00:41:48,365 --> 00:41:51,539
以诡计、残暴、决绝的方式
With trickery, brutality, finality.

687
00:41:52,012 --> 00:41:53,420
来匹配他们的邪恶
We match their evil.

688
00:41:57,610 --> 00:41:58,533
我知道，詹姆斯
I know, James.

689
00:41:59,176 --> 00:42:00,904
我被誉为一个温和的人
I was reputed to be a gentle man.

690
00:42:01,306 --> 00:42:02,687
但我是总司令
But I was commander in chief

691
00:42:03,265 --> 00:42:06,311
在我国历史上最血腥的四年里
during the four bloodiest years of my country's history.

692
00:42:07,113 --> 00:42:11,443
我的命令让十万人死于
I gave orders that sent 100,000 men to their death

693
00:42:12,346 --> 00:42:14,511
他们兄弟的手中
at the hands of their brothers.

694
00:42:17,202 --> 00:42:18,727
没有光荣的杀戮
There's no honorable way to kill,

695
00:42:20,585 --> 00:42:21,712
也没有温和的毁灭
no gentle way to destroy.

696
00:42:21,933 --> 00:42:23,879
战争除了终结战争没有什么好处
There is nothing good in war except its ending.

697
00:42:26,733 --> 00:42:29,165
你正在为你船员的生命而战
And you're fighting for the lives of your crew.

698
00:42:31,685 --> 00:42:34,028
是你的战役，总统先生
Your campaign, Mr. President.

699
00:42:35,698 --> 00:42:36,914
他们应该很快就会来
They should be coming soon.

700
00:42:54,338 --> 00:42:55,229
佐拉！凯勒斯！
Zora! Kahless!

701
00:42:57,251 --> 00:42:57,741
不，等等！
No, wait!

702
00:43:01,854 --> 00:43:02,540
你看到了几个人？
How many did you see?

703
00:43:02,701 --> 00:43:03,134
两个
Two.

704
00:44:07,831 --> 00:44:11,223
苏拉克，其他人已经把他们引开了
Surak, the others have drawn them away.

705
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:14,083
我们会绕一圈
We will circle around.

706
00:44:16,074 --> 00:44:18,890
这是一个值得的努力，苏拉克，值得的
It was a worthy effort, Surak. Worthy.

707
00:44:19,914 --> 00:44:22,727
没必要因为它的失败而责怪自己
No need to blame yourself for its failure.

708
00:44:28,859 --> 00:44:30,256
帮帮我，史波克
Help me, Spock.

709
00:44:31,853 --> 00:44:33,366
帮帮我，史波克
Help me, Spock.

710
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:37,439
现在你能学林肯的哭喊吗？
Now can you cry like Lincoln?

711
00:44:38,270 --> 00:44:39,991
帮帮我，柯克
Help me, Kirk.

712
00:44:42,198 --> 00:44:44,056
帮帮我，柯克
Help me, Kirk.

713
00:44:54,089 --> 00:44:54,691
林肯先生！
Mr. Lincoln!

714
00:44:55,297 --> 00:44:57,263
詹姆斯，别过来
James, stay back.

715
00:46:26,688 --> 00:46:28,185
你们是幸存者
You are the survivors.

716
00:46:29,072 --> 00:46:30,224
其他人都逃跑了
The others have run off.

717
00:46:31,455 --> 00:46:34,341
看来，邪恶在强行对抗时就会退缩
It would seem that evil retreats when forcibly confronted.

718
00:46:34,919 --> 00:46:38,181
然而，你们未能向我证明
However, you have failed to demonstrate to me

719
00:46:38,181 --> 00:46:40,444
你们的哲学之间有任何其他区别
any other difference between your philosophies.

720
00:46:41,416 --> 00:46:43,542
你的善和恶用同样的手段
Your good and your evil use the same methods,

721
00:46:43,687 --> 00:46:45,200
达到相同的结果
achieve the same results.

722
00:46:46,729 --> 00:46:48,009
你有什么解释吗？
Do you have an explanation?

723
00:46:48,478 --> 00:46:50,590
你制定了方法和目标
You established the methods and the goals.

724
00:46:51,151 --> 00:46:53,041
供你选择使用
For you to use as you chose.

725
00:46:53,153 --> 00:46:54,490
如果他们赢了，你给他们什么？
What did you offer the others if they won?

726
00:46:54,899 --> 00:46:56,183
他们最想要的
What they wanted most.

727
00:46:56,890 --> 00:46:57,627
力量
Power.

728
00:46:59,586 --> 00:47:03,057
你给了我我船员的生命
You offered me the lives of my crew.

729
00:47:03,936 --> 00:47:07,904
我认为你赢得了他们的生命
I perceive you have won their lives.

730
00:47:08,936 --> 00:47:10,205
你对多少人做过这样的事？
How many others have you done this to?

731
00:47:11,248 --> 00:47:14,064
是什么让你有权决定生死？
What gives you the right to hand out life and death?

732
00:47:14,739 --> 00:47:16,790
促使你来这里的同样的权利
The same right that brought you here.

733
00:47:17,436 --> 00:47:19,228
了解新事物的需要
The need to know new things.

734
00:47:22,035 --> 00:47:22,777
我们和平地来
We came in peace.

735
00:47:23,038 --> 00:47:24,851
那你们可以和平地离开
And you may go in peace.

736
00:47:36,935 --> 00:47:38,023
柯克呼叫企业号，进来
Kirk to Enterprise. Come in.

737
00:47:38,548 --> 00:47:39,287
苏鲁：是你吗，舰长？
SULU: Is that you, Captain?

738
00:47:39,728 --> 00:47:40,382
你们还好吗？
Are you all right?

739
00:47:41,088 --> 00:47:42,481
是的，苏鲁先生，我们没事
Yes, Mr. Sulu, we're all right.

740
00:47:43,685 --> 00:47:44,581
你可以把我们传送上船了
You may beam us aboard.

741
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:52,975
斯科特先生，报告
Mr. Scott, report.

742
00:47:53,183 --> 00:47:55,037
飞船恢复正常运转了，长官
The ship is functioning normally again, sir,

743
00:47:55,037 --> 00:47:56,815
重启循环正在运行
and the restart cycle is in operation.

744
00:47:57,261 --> 00:47:59,287
看起来不像发生过故障
You'd never know anything had been out of order.

745
00:47:59,307 --> 00:48:00,094
我无法理解
I can't fathom it.

746
00:48:00,150 --> 00:48:00,694
苏鲁先生
Mr. Sulu.

747
00:48:00,953 --> 00:48:02,870
我们应该在 30 分钟内启动曲速，长官
We should be on warp power within 30 minutes, sir.

748
00:48:03,079 --> 00:48:04,303
很好，契科夫先生
Good. Mister Chekov.

749
00:48:04,901 --> 00:48:08,204
护盾的衰减已停止并且正在自我修复
The deterioration in the shielding has stopped and is reversing itself.

750
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:09,083
我无法解释
I have no explanation.

751
00:48:09,235 --> 00:48:10,094
谢谢你，契科夫先生
Thank you, Mr. Chekov.

752
00:48:13,433 --> 00:48:16,313
史波克先生，有解释吗？
Mr. Spock. Any explanation?

753
00:48:17,386 --> 00:48:19,633
猜想，而非解释
Conjecture, rather than explanation.

754
00:48:20,556 --> 00:48:21,001
说说？
Well?

755
00:48:21,350 --> 00:48:25,190
我们似乎被能够控制物质的生物的力量所束缚
It would seem that we were held in the power of creatures able to control matter

756
00:48:25,676 --> 00:48:28,812
并以任何想要的方式重新排列分子
and to rearrange molecules in whatever fashion was desired.

757
00:48:29,633 --> 00:48:33,161
所以他们能够创造出苏拉克和林肯的形象
So they were able to create images of Surak and Lincoln

758
00:48:33,431 --> 00:48:37,880
在扫描了我们的大脑并使用同胞作为源材料后
after scanning our minds and using their fellow creatures as source matter.

759
00:48:38,311 --> 00:48:39,272
他们看起来很真实
They seemed so real.

760
00:48:40,127 --> 00:48:42,916
对我来说，尤其是林肯先生
And to me, especially Mr. Lincoln.

761
00:48:45,043 --> 00:48:47,027
我觉得我真的见到了林肯
I feel I actually met Lincoln.

762
00:48:48,651 --> 00:48:50,891
是的，还有苏拉克
Yes. And Surak.

763
00:48:51,941 --> 00:48:54,629
也许，从某种意义上说，它们是真实的，舰长
Perhaps, in a sense, they were real, Captain.

764
00:48:55,408 --> 00:48:57,374
既然他们是由我们自己的思想创造出来的
Since they were created out of our own thoughts,

765
00:48:57,656 --> 00:49:00,254
怎么可能不是我们期望的那样呢？
how could they be anything but what we expected them to be?

766
00:49:00,718 --> 00:49:04,110
看到他再次死去，我很难过
It was so hard for me to see him die again.

767
00:49:05,770 --> 00:49:10,764
我觉得我理解了地球为实现最后的和平所必须经历的事情
I feel I understand what Earth must have gone through to achieve final peace.

768
00:49:11,316 --> 00:49:15,060
柯克舰长，这颗星球恢复了正常外观
Captain Kirk, the planet has resumed its normal appearance.

769
00:49:23,242 --> 00:49:26,389
他们在银河系中还有很多工作要做，史波克
There is still so much of their work to be done in the galaxy, Spock.

770
00:49:28,993 --> 00:49:33,560
苏鲁先生，让我们脱离轨道，继续我们的下一个任务
Mr. Sulu, break us out of orbit and continue to our next assignment.

771
00:49:34,025 --> 00:49:34,647
是的，长官
Aye, aye, sir.
