1
00:00:12,158 --> 00:00:16,287
- 一颗幽灵星球？  - 我不建议超自然的解释，舰长
- A ghost planet? - I suggest no supernatural explanation, Captain.

2
00:00:16,454 --> 00:00:20,500
但事实并不符合任何已知的行星类别
But the facts do not fit any known categories of planets.

3
00:00:20,667 --> 00:00:24,170
- 让我们看看现实，那应该能解释某些东西  - 毫无疑问
- Let's take the facts. That should explain something. - Undoubtedly.

4
00:00:24,462 --> 00:00:27,799
这个星球的年龄看起来只有几千年
The age of this planet would seem to be only a few thousand years.

5
00:00:27,966 --> 00:00:31,719
植被不可能在这么短的时间内进化
Vegetation cannot evolve in so short a period.

6
00:00:31,886 --> 00:00:34,347
它的大小和地球的月亮差不多
Its size is approximately that of Earth's moon.

7
00:00:34,514 --> 00:00:38,685
但它的质量和大气与地球相似
But its mass and its atmosphere are similar to Earth.

8
00:00:38,935 --> 00:00:43,523
- 这很难解释  - 这不可能，舰长
- That would be difficult to explain. - It would be impossible, Captain.

9
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:46,651
大气不可能演变得这么快
An atmosphere could not evolve so quickly.

10
00:00:46,818 --> 00:00:48,903
- 然而它就是如此  - 显然
- And yet it has. - Evidently.

11
00:00:49,112 --> 00:00:54,659
但这种不一致呈现出一种看似不可能的现象
But the inconsistencies present a seemingly impossible phenomenon.

12
00:00:54,826 --> 00:00:58,246
- 但是很迷人，史波克先生  - 没错，舰长
- But a fascinating one, Mr. Spock. - Precisely, Captain.

13
00:00:58,454 --> 00:01:02,834
如果我们要给星际舰队提供一份准确的报告，则需要进一步调查
It would bear closer investigation if we are to provide Starfleet with an accurate report.

14
00:01:03,084 --> 00:01:06,337
上尉，让麦考伊医生到传送室加入调查小队
Lieutenant, send Dr. McCoy to the transporter room for survey party.

15
00:01:06,504 --> 00:01:08,881
我们还需要高级地质学家达马托
We'll also need Senior Geologist D'Amato.

16
00:01:09,048 --> 00:01:13,428
把传送坐标发给传送室，苏鲁先生，你跟我走
Feed beam down coordinates to the transporter room. Mr. Sulu, you'll accompany me.

17
00:01:13,595 --> 00:01:16,097
史波克先生，你来掌舵
Mr. Spock, you have the conn.

18
00:01:19,017 --> 00:01:22,604
拉达上尉，立即到舰桥报告
Lieutenant Radha, report to the bridge immediately.

19
00:01:25,106 --> 00:01:27,692
这次探险应该是地质学家的梦想
This expedition should be a geologist's dream.

20
00:01:27,859 --> 00:01:31,613
有机会探索如此年轻的星球是幸运的
The opportunity to explore so young a planet is lucky.

21
00:01:31,779 --> 00:01:36,409
是的，如果史波克先生是对的，你会有一份震惊星际地球物理会议的报告
Yes. If Mr. Spock is correct, you'll have a report to startle the Interstellar Geophysical Conference.

22
00:01:36,576 --> 00:01:40,204
- 为什么？它是什么，吉姆？  - 一个连史波克都无法解释的行星
- Why? What is it, Jim? - A planet even Spock can't explain.

23
00:01:40,371 --> 00:01:42,415
准备传送
Prepare to transport.

24
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:49,494
启动
Energize.

25
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:54,376
等等！你们不能去
Wait! You must not go.

26
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:16,349
吉姆，你看到我看到的了吗？
Jim, did you see what I saw?

27
00:02:16,349 --> 00:02:18,274
那个女人袭击了怀亚特少尉，柯克呼叫…
That woman attacked Ensign Wyatt. Kirk to...

28
00:02:18,657 --> 00:02:18,976
舰长！
Captain!

29
00:02:19,577 --> 00:02:21,579
[爆炸] 
[EXPLOSION] 

30
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:42,350
史波克先生，你还好吗？
Mr. Spock, are you all right?

31
00:02:42,558 --> 00:02:44,632
是的，我认为没有造成永久性伤害
Yes. I believe no permanent damage was done.

32
00:02:44,776 --> 00:02:45,541
发生了什么？
What happened?

33
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:50,813
我的后脑勺好像撞到了椅子的扶手
The occipital area of my head seems to have impacted with the arm of the chair.

34
00:02:50,942 --> 00:02:53,529
不，史波克先生，我是说我们发生了什么事？
No, Mr. Spock. I meant what happened to us?

35
00:02:53,529 --> 00:02:55,105
这个我们还没有查明
That we have yet to ascertain.

36
00:02:55,196 --> 00:02:57,482
史波克先生！星球消失了！
Mr. Spock! The planet's gone!

37
00:03:00,706 --> 00:03:02,795
这个地方有怎样的地震？
What kind of earthquakes do they have in this place?

38
00:03:02,795 --> 00:03:03,395
我不知道，再这样震法也许能撕裂这个星球
I don't know. Any more like that would tear this planet apart.

39
00:03:06,332 --> 00:03:10,691
舰长，我们感受到的地震，如果刚刚是的话…
Captain, this tremor we felt, if that's what it was...

40
00:03:11,295 --> 00:03:14,341
它完全不像我以前感觉到的地震扰动
and it's certainly like no seismic disturbance I've felt before.

41
00:03:15,007 --> 00:03:19,218
我读到了几乎不可估量的能量，但它又不在了
I got a reading of almost immeasurable power, but it's not there any more.

42
00:03:20,221 --> 00:03:21,919
地震应力可以解释它吗？
Could seismic stress account for it?

43
00:03:23,307 --> 00:03:26,765
我得到的读数与地震力无关
The reading I got had nothing to do with a seismic force.

44
00:03:27,979 --> 00:03:32,233
很奇怪，还有那个女人，柯克呼叫企业号
That's very strange. And that woman. Kirk to Enterprise.

45
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,039
企业号，请回答
Enterprise, come in.

46
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:37,083
震动可能把它弄坏了
The shock may have damaged it.

47
00:03:37,705 --> 00:03:38,552
它消失了！
It's gone!

48
00:03:40,076 --> 00:03:41,873
企业号，消失了！
The Enterprise. It's gone!

49
00:03:44,036 --> 00:03:46,497
他是对的，那里什么都没有
He's right. There's nothing there.

50
00:03:46,658 --> 00:03:48,999
它怎么会消失？吉姆，那到底是什么意思？
How could it be gone? What the devil does that mean, Jim?

51
00:03:49,286 --> 00:03:52,854
一方面…这意味着我们被困了
For one thing... it means we're stranded.

52
00:04:08,186 --> 00:04:11,189
[柯克] 宇宙，最后的边疆
[Kirk] Space, the final frontier.

53
00:04:17,195 --> 00:04:21,282
这些是星舰企业号的航程
These are the voyages of the starship Enterprise.

54
00:04:21,449 --> 00:04:25,536
它的五年任务：探索未知的新世界
Its five-year mission: To explore strange new worlds,

55
00:04:25,703 --> 00:04:29,582
寻找新生命和新文明
to seek out new life and new civilizations,

56
00:04:29,749 --> 00:04:32,960
勇踏前人未至之境
to boldly go where no man has gone before.

57
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:08,075
幸存之物
That Which Survives

58
00:05:14,752 --> 00:05:16,963
企业号一定是爆炸了
The Enterprise must have blown up.

59
00:05:17,255 --> 00:05:20,633
那能解释高辐射读数，不是吗，舰长？如果物质-反物质引擎
That would explain the high-radiation readings, wouldn't it? If the matter-antimatter engines

60
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,182
苏鲁先生，我们不应该停止猜测，并尝试建立一个模式吗
Shouldn't we stop guessing, Mr. Sulu, and try and establish a pattern?

61
00:05:23,536 --> 00:05:25,796
我没有得到高能量强度的读数
I get no readings of high energy concentration.

62
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:29,892
如果企业号爆炸了，它会留下辐射
If the Enterprise had blown up, it would have left radiation.

63
00:05:30,434 --> 00:05:33,286
会不会是企业号撞击了这个星球？
Could it be the Enterprise hit us, hit the planet?

64
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:38,568
在西伯利亚曾经有一颗流星巨大到它把森林夷为了平地…
Once in Siberia there was a meteor so great that it flattened forests and was felt as far...

65
00:05:38,776 --> 00:05:41,858
如果我想听俄罗斯历史课，我会带上契科夫
Mr. Sulu, if I'd wanted a Russian history lesson, I'd have brought Chekov.

66
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,180
这是一个生存问题，先生们
This is a matter of survival, gentlemen.

67
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:51,205
没有企业号，我们需要食物和水，而且我们很快就需要它们
Without the Enterprise, we need food and we need water, and we need them fast.

68
00:05:51,205 --> 00:05:53,998
我要这个星球的详细分析，现在就要
I want a detailed analysis made of this planet and I want it now.

69
00:05:55,042 --> 00:05:56,385
- 是的，长官  - 是的，长官
- Aye, sir. - Yes, sir.

70
00:05:57,598 --> 00:05:58,779
苏鲁先生
Mr. Sulu.

71
00:06:04,174 --> 00:06:06,474
轮机部，无损伤，所有动力水平正常
Engineering, no damage. All power levels normal.

72
00:06:06,887 --> 00:06:11,017
飞船运行正常，有一些磕碰和擦伤
Ship functioning normally. Many bumps and bruises.

73
00:06:11,976 --> 00:06:15,397
一例人员伤亡，传送人员，他死了
One casualty. The transporter officer. He's dead.

74
00:06:16,305 --> 00:06:17,532
死了？
Dead?

75
00:06:18,816 --> 00:06:20,171
史波克呼叫医务室
Spock to Sickbay.

76
00:06:20,171 --> 00:06:21,629
医务室，姆本加医生
Sickbay. Dr. M'Benga.

77
00:06:21,694 --> 00:06:23,821
报告传送人员的死亡情况
Report on the death of the transpoter officer.

78
00:06:24,071 --> 00:06:27,908
我们不确定，桑切斯医生现在正在进行尸检
We're not sure. Dr. Sanchez is conducting an autopsy right now.

79
00:06:28,868 --> 00:06:33,001
嗯…尽快给我一份完整的报告，通话完毕
Mmm... Give me a full report as soon as possible. Spock out.

80
00:06:34,273 --> 00:06:38,560
斯科特先生，检查传送装置是否有故障
Mr. Scott, have the transporter checked for possible malfunction.

81
00:06:38,796 --> 00:06:39,396
是的，长官
Aye, sir.

82
00:06:39,837 --> 00:06:42,970
没有任何形式的残骸，我已经进行了两次全面扫描
No debris of any kind. I've made two full scans.

83
00:06:43,382 --> 00:06:45,756
如果这个星球破裂了，会有一些迹象
If the planet had broken up, there would be some sign.

84
00:06:47,534 --> 00:06:49,852
困扰我的是星星，史波克先生
What bothers me is the stars, Mr. Spock.

85
00:06:50,126 --> 00:06:50,927
星星
The stars.

86
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:53,442
是的，长官，他们不对
Yes, sir. They're wrong.

87
00:06:53,934 --> 00:06:54,741
错误的？
Wrong?

88
00:06:54,921 --> 00:06:56,446
是的，史波克先生
Yes Mr. Spock.

89
00:06:56,518 --> 00:06:57,457
看
Look.

90
00:07:00,191 --> 00:07:03,358
这是爆炸前星星分布的样子
Here's a replay of the star pattern just before the explosion.

91
00:07:06,929 --> 00:07:08,577
位置变化了
A positional change.

92
00:07:08,905 --> 00:07:10,574
这说不通
It doesn't make any sense.

93
00:07:11,082 --> 00:07:13,505
不知为何，在那一瞬间
But somehow I'd say that in a flash

94
00:07:13,505 --> 00:07:16,426
我们被撞到了距我们所在位置1,000光年之外的地方
We've been knocked 1,000 light years away from where we were.

95
00:07:16,488 --> 00:07:20,628
准确地说是990.7光年，上尉
990.7 light years to be exact, Lieutenant.

96
00:07:20,628 --> 00:07:23,233
但这不可能，没有东西能做到
But that's not possible. Nothing can do that.

97
00:07:23,631 --> 00:07:29,980
斯科特先生，既然我们在这里，你的发言既不合逻辑，也不值得反驳
Mr. Scott, since we are here, your statement is not only illogical but also unworthy of refutation.

98
00:07:30,721 --> 00:07:32,664
假设任何爆炸
It is also illogical to assume

99
00:07:32,664 --> 00:07:36,078
即使是一颗恒星变为超新星爆发
that any explosion, even that of a small star going supernova,

100
00:07:36,078 --> 00:07:39,979
把我们扔到990.7光年外，也是不合逻辑的
could have hurled us a distance of 990.7 light years.

101
00:07:40,439 --> 00:07:43,019
它不会把我们扔到什么地方
The point is it shouldn't have hurled us anywhere.

102
00:07:43,378 --> 00:07:46,048
而是会立即摧毁我们，汽化我们
It should have destroyed us immediately, vaporized us!

103
00:07:46,487 --> 00:07:48,739
根据我们知道的定律，没错，斯科特先生
That is correct, Mr. Scott, by all the laws that we know.

104
00:07:48,906 --> 00:07:50,447
没有无意识的时间
There was no period of unconsciousness.

105
00:07:50,514 --> 00:07:53,266
船上的计时器只记录了几秒钟
Our ship's chronometers registered only seconds.

106
00:07:53,337 --> 00:07:55,663
因此，我们被移动了
therefore we were displaced

107
00:07:56,181 --> 00:07:58,682
以某种我无法理解的方式
in some manner which I am unable to fathom.

108
00:07:58,856 --> 00:08:01,156
所以星球没有爆炸
What you're saying is that the planet didn't blow up.

109
00:08:01,156 --> 00:08:01,756
舰长还活着！
And the captain is still alive!

110
00:08:03,421 --> 00:08:06,326
斯科特先生，请克制你不合逻辑的跳跃
Please, Mr. Scott, restrain your leaps of illogic.

111
00:08:06,326 --> 00:08:09,226
我什么都没说，我只是在猜测
I have said nothing. I was merely speculating.

112
00:08:10,679 --> 00:08:12,116
[姆本加] 医务室呼叫史波克先生
[M'Benga] Sickbay to Mr. Spock.

113
00:08:12,311 --> 00:08:14,139
我是史波克
Spock here.

114
00:08:14,306 --> 00:08:15,991
你要求验尸报告
You asked for an autopsy report.

115
00:08:16,511 --> 00:08:20,938
死因似乎是细胞破裂
It's only preliminary, but he cause of death seems to have been cellular disruption.

116
00:08:21,403 --> 00:08:22,606
解释一下
Explain.

117
00:08:22,682 --> 00:08:26,444
仿佛每一个细胞都被从里面炸开
It's as though every cell in the body had been individually blasted from inside.

118
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:29,231
任何已知的疾病生物会这样做吗？
Would any known disease organism do that?

119
00:08:29,231 --> 00:08:31,445
桑切斯医生已经排除了这一点
Dr. Sanchez has ruled that possibility out, sir.

120
00:08:31,657 --> 00:08:33,744
请随时通知我，通话完毕
Please keep me fully advised. Spock out.

121
00:08:35,187 --> 00:08:37,200
他在传送室
He was in the transporter room.

122
00:08:37,788 --> 00:08:42,334
柯克舰长一行人离开后，可能有人进来了
Someone may have entered after Captain Kirk and his party left.

123
00:08:43,836 --> 00:08:46,661
斯科特先生，由于企业号工作正常
Mr. Scott, since the Enterprise is obviously functional,

124
00:08:46,661 --> 00:08:49,726
我建议让我们以最快的曲速返回我们的起点
I suggest we return to our starting place at top warp speed.

125
00:08:50,168 --> 00:08:51,009
是的，长官
Aye, sir.

126
00:08:51,302 --> 00:08:53,804
是的，但我们需要一段时间才能到达那里
But even at that, it will take us a while to get there.

127
00:08:53,971 --> 00:08:57,134
在这种情况下，斯科特先生，我建议我们立即出发
In that case, Mr. Scott, I suggest we start at once.

128
00:08:57,252 --> 00:08:58,587
你能给我曲速8吗？
Can you give me warp 8?

129
00:08:58,726 --> 00:09:01,562
是的，长官，也许更多一点
Aye, sir. And maybe a wee bit more.

130
00:09:01,729 --> 00:09:04,337
我会亲自坐在曲速引擎上照顾它们
I'll sit on the warp engines myself and nurse them.

131
00:09:05,316 --> 00:09:09,820
斯科特先生，那个姿势不仅没有用
That position, Mr. Scott, would not only be unavailing,

132
00:09:09,987 --> 00:09:12,572
还有失体面
but also undignified.

133
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,643
拉达上尉，绘制航线…
Lieutenant Rahda, Plot a course.

134
00:09:17,643 --> 00:09:19,659
已经绘制并设定好了，长官
Already plotted and laid in, sir.

135
00:09:20,441 --> 00:09:22,643
好的，那么准备达到曲速8
Good. Then prepare to come to warp 8.

136
00:09:24,084 --> 00:09:25,944
你的报告涵盖了所有植被？
Your report covers all vegetation?

137
00:09:26,227 --> 00:09:26,981
是的，舰长
Yes, Captain.

138
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:30,341
所有植物都不能食用，对我们有毒
All vegetation is inedible. Poison to us.

139
00:09:30,674 --> 00:09:34,015
如果企业号被摧毁，你知道我们还能生存多久
If the Enterprise has been destroyed, you know how long we can survive.

140
00:09:36,022 --> 00:09:36,607
是的
Yes.

141
00:09:37,937 --> 00:09:41,125
我没有看到任何水，但一定有才能使植被生长
I don't see any water, but there must be some to grow the vegetation.

142
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:43,486
水源会延长我们的生存时间
A source of water would stretch our survival.

143
00:09:43,871 --> 00:09:46,525
你看到下雨的迹象了吗？
Did you see any evidence of rainfall?

144
00:09:46,767 --> 00:09:49,713
不，长官，也没有证据表明以前下过雨
No, sir. I haven't seen any evidence that there ever has been rainfall.

145
00:09:49,991 --> 00:09:51,933
但是有植被
But there is earth-type vegetation.

146
00:09:52,183 --> 00:09:55,283
植被能从空气中吸收水分吗？
Is it possible the vegetation could absorb the water directly from the air?

147
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:58,536
是的，有可能，也可能有地下水
Yes, that's possible. There's also the possibility of underground water.

148
00:09:59,072 --> 00:10:00,356
是的，长官，可能有
Yes, sir. Could be.

149
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:03,292
苏鲁探测到了一种类似病毒的生物
Sulu's picked up an organism that's almost a virus.

150
00:10:03,292 --> 00:10:06,988
像一种植物寄生虫，这是我能找到的最接近生命的生物形式
Like a plant parasite. And it's the nearest biological form of life I can find.

151
00:10:07,586 --> 00:10:09,817
这显然会是我们的家，只要我们活下去
This apparently is gonna our home for as long as we can last.

152
00:10:09,817 --> 00:10:12,502
我建议我们尽可能多地了解它，分头行动
I suggest we find out as much as we can about it. Split out.

153
00:10:12,718 --> 00:10:15,829
- 达马托，找找看是否有地下水  - 是的，长官
- D'Amato, see if you can find underground water. - Yes, sir.

154
00:10:15,829 --> 00:10:18,544
- 苏鲁，进行大气分析  - 是的，长官
- Sulu, run an atmospheric analysis. - Aye, sir.

155
00:10:18,544 --> 00:10:24,309
老骨头，看看你能不能找出关于植被和寄生虫的任何信息
Bones, see if you can find out anything about the vegetation and your parasite.

156
00:10:24,729 --> 00:10:26,332
它们如何获得水分的？
How do they get their moisture?

157
00:10:26,815 --> 00:10:30,591
如果你能发现它们是如何生存的，也许我们也可以
If you can discover how they survive, maybe we can.

158
00:10:44,957 --> 00:10:46,010
苏鲁呼叫舰长
Sulu to Captain.

159
00:10:47,339 --> 00:10:48,120
我是柯克
Kirk here.

160
00:10:48,597 --> 00:10:50,840
我正在做一个标准的磁性扫描
Captain, I was making a standard magnetic sweep.

161
00:10:51,205 --> 00:10:53,838
我得到了一个超出范围的读数
From zero I suddenly got a reading that was off the scale,

162
00:10:54,218 --> 00:10:58,473
然后极性反转…现在又没了
then a reverse of polarity and... now I get nothing.

163
00:10:58,762 --> 00:11:00,806
我从未见过这样的事情
I've not seen anything like this reading.

164
00:11:00,973 --> 00:11:05,644
就像一扇门打开然后又关上
Like a door opened and then closed again.

165
00:11:08,608 --> 00:11:09,491
通话完毕
Kirk out.

166
00:12:04,771 --> 00:12:05,972
不要害怕
Do not be afraid.

167
00:12:07,102 --> 00:12:07,857
我没有
I'm not.

168
00:12:08,666 --> 00:12:11,877
地质扰动不会吓到我，我来这里就是研究它们
Geological disturbances don't frighten me. I come here to study them.

169
00:12:12,044 --> 00:12:13,257
我的专长
My speciality.

170
00:12:13,822 --> 00:12:14,715
我知道
I know.

171
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:19,510
你是达马托上尉，高级地质学家
You are Lieutenant D'Amato. Senior geologist.

172
00:12:19,725 --> 00:12:21,117
没错，你怎么知道的？
That's right. How did you know that?

173
00:12:21,194 --> 00:12:22,965
来自企业号
From the spaceship Enterprise.

174
00:12:24,348 --> 00:12:26,143
是的，我们被困在这里
Yes, we're stranded here.

175
00:12:26,507 --> 00:12:28,201
你和我的朋友说过话了吗？
Have you been talking to my friends?

176
00:12:30,588 --> 00:12:31,861
不要害怕
Do not be afraid.

177
00:12:33,715 --> 00:12:35,014
我不怕
I'm not afraid.

178
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,511
我是来找你的，达马托上尉
I am for you, Lieutenant D'Amato.

179
00:12:42,437 --> 00:12:45,301
你是…你是企业号上的女人
You're...You're the woman on the Enterprise.

180
00:12:45,373 --> 00:12:47,355
我只为了来找达马托
I am only for D'Amato.

181
00:12:48,731 --> 00:12:50,990
幸运的达马托
Lucky D'Amato.

182
00:12:52,209 --> 00:12:54,075
我想和你商量一下分享你的食物和水
Wanna have a conference about sharing your food and water.

183
00:12:54,075 --> 00:12:55,056
不要叫其他人
Do not call the others.

184
00:12:56,827 --> 00:12:57,528
拜托
Please.

185
00:13:05,597 --> 00:13:06,386
麦考伊呼叫柯克
McCoy to Kirk.

186
00:13:06,771 --> 00:13:07,371
我是柯克
Kirk here.

187
00:13:07,975 --> 00:13:11,345
吉姆，我刚刚得到了一个巨大强度的生命形式读数
Jim, I just got a life-form reading of tremendous intensity.

188
00:13:11,345 --> 00:13:12,515
突然间，它就在那里
Suddenly it was just there.

189
00:13:12,938 --> 00:13:14,009
就在那里是什么意思？
What do you mean "just there"?

190
00:13:14,543 --> 00:13:15,560
就是说
Just that.

191
00:13:16,032 --> 00:13:21,321
所有水平都正常，然后显示生物激增
All levels were normal, then I get this biological surge of life-form registering.

192
00:13:22,614 --> 00:13:24,097
不，现在没了
No. Now it's gone.

193
00:13:24,307 --> 00:13:24,907
就像一扇门打开然后又关上
As though a door opened and closed.

194
00:13:27,228 --> 00:13:27,901
是的
Yes.

195
00:13:28,111 --> 00:13:28,964
什么方向？
What direction?

196
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:34,077
083
083.

197
00:13:34,606 --> 00:13:35,206
等一下
Hang on.

198
00:13:35,992 --> 00:13:37,178
达马托区，请回答
D'Amato's section, come in.

199
00:13:38,589 --> 00:13:39,950
柯克呼叫达马托，请回答
Kirk to D'Amato. Come in.

200
00:13:41,377 --> 00:13:42,234
请回答
Come in.

201
00:13:42,763 --> 00:13:45,262
老骨头，苏鲁，达马托不回复
Bones, Sulu, D'Amato doesn't answer.

202
00:13:45,429 --> 00:13:46,557
我马上过去
I'll be right there.

203
00:13:57,316 --> 00:13:58,226
老骨头！
Bones!

204
00:14:10,988 --> 00:14:14,374
他身体的每一个细胞都被破坏了
Jim, every cell in his body's been disrupted.

205
00:14:28,705 --> 00:14:29,893
吉姆，你在做什么？
Jim, what are you doing?

206
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:32,385
挖坟
Digging a grave.

207
00:14:32,709 --> 00:14:35,733
可怜的达马托，多么可怕的死亡方式
Poor D'Amato. What a terrible way to die.

208
00:14:36,975 --> 00:14:39,105
没有好方式，苏鲁
There are no good ways, Sulu.

209
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:57,063
同样的红色岩石
That's the same red rock. 

210
00:14:57,618 --> 00:14:58,896
我的相位枪没能切开它
My phaser didn't cut through it.

211
00:14:59,404 --> 00:15:01,588
它具有极高的熔点
Whatever it is, it has a mighty high melting point.

212
00:15:01,588 --> 00:15:05,667
8,000摄氏度，它看起来像火成岩，但密度更大
8,000 degrees centigrade. It looks like igneous rock, but infinitely denser.

213
00:15:22,192 --> 00:15:25,530
这整个星​​球一定由它组成，表层由土壤覆盖
This whole planet must be made up of this substance, covered over by top soil.

214
00:15:25,915 --> 00:15:30,653
苏鲁先生，如果我们知道这物质是什么，也许能更好地解释这个地方
Mr. Sulu, it might explain this place a little better if we knew what the substance is.

215
00:15:30,946 --> 00:15:35,048
我知道这本来是达马托负责的区域，但看看你能找到什么
I know it was D'Amato's field, but see what you can find out.

216
00:15:35,224 --> 00:15:37,226
是的，长官
Yes, sir.

217
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:43,458
我想石头墓是我们能为达马托提供的最好的东西
I guess a tomb of rocks is the best we can provide for D'Amato.

218
00:15:44,037 --> 00:15:47,851
是的，这可能是最合适的纪念
Yeah. It might be the most suitable memorial at that.

219
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:56,481
我想知道是什么杀死了他
I wonder what killed him.

220
00:15:58,604 --> 00:16:04,290
我不知道，但一定是什么东西或什么人干的
I don't know. But something or someone did.

221
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:13,163
我们正保持曲速8.4，长官
We're holding warp 8.4, sir.

222
00:16:13,412 --> 00:16:18,371
如果我们保持这个速度，预计到达时间是11.5个太阳时
If we can maintain it, our estimated time of arrival is 11 and one half solar hours.

223
00:16:18,475 --> 00:16:23,019
11.337小时，上尉，我希望你能更精确
11.337 hours, Lieutenant. I wish you would be more precise.

224
00:16:23,386 --> 00:16:26,251
斯科特呼叫舰桥，斯科特呼叫舰桥
Scott to bridge. Scott to bridge.

225
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:30,928
- 我是史波克  - 史波克先生，这艘船感觉不对
- Spock here. - Mr. Spock, the ship feels wrong.

226
00:16:31,575 --> 00:16:33,371
“感觉”，斯科特先生？
"Feels", Mr. Scott?

227
00:16:33,764 --> 00:16:38,741
我知道这说不通，仪器读数正确，但感觉不对
I know it doesn't make sense. Instrumentation reads correct but the feel is wrong.

228
00:16:38,859 --> 00:16:40,651
是我无法用语言表达的
It's something I can't put into words.

229
00:16:40,743 --> 00:16:42,607
这很明显，斯科特先生
That is obvious, Mr. Scott.

230
00:16:42,674 --> 00:16:46,568
避免情绪化并保持你的仪器正确
I suggest you avoid emotionalism and simply keep your instruments correct.

231
00:16:46,735 --> 00:16:47,633
通话完毕
Spock out.

232
00:17:22,813 --> 00:17:24,323
看起来很孤独
It looks so lonely there.

233
00:17:25,248 --> 00:17:27,229
如果他有伴，那就更糟了
It would be worse if he had company.

234
00:17:28,677 --> 00:17:30,392
医生，你怎么能拿它开玩笑呢？
Doctor, how can you joke about it?

235
00:17:31,121 --> 00:17:34,360
我没有开玩笑，在我们知道是什么杀死了他之前，我们谁都不安全
I'm not joking. Until we know what killed him, none of us are safe.

236
00:17:35,361 --> 00:17:38,289
我们必须弄明白并设计防御措施
We've got to figure this out and devise a defense against it.

237
00:17:39,155 --> 00:17:41,832
有没有可能石头有生命？
Is it possible that the rocks have life?

238
00:17:41,912 --> 00:17:45,836
- 你记得在杰纳斯六号上，硅基生物…  - 但我们的仪器记录了它
- You remember on Janus VI, the silicon creatures... - But our instruments recorded that.

239
00:17:46,003 --> 00:17:48,900
他们显示为生命形式
They registered as life-forms.

240
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:54,248
除非我们与能够隐藏自己的智能生物打交道
Unless we're dealing with intelligent beings who can shield themselves.

241
00:17:54,511 --> 00:17:56,972
智能到足以摧毁飞船？
Beings intelligent enough to destroy the Enterprise?

242
00:17:57,222 --> 00:17:59,977
那就是问题所在，我们只有问题
That's the problem, Sulu. We have only questions.

243
00:18:00,737 --> 00:18:02,010
没有答案
No answers.

244
00:18:44,029 --> 00:18:44,930
沃特金斯
Watkins.

245
00:18:46,761 --> 00:18:50,647
检查物质-反物质反应室上的旁通阀
Check the bypass valve on the matter-antimatter reaction chamber.

246
00:18:51,366 --> 00:18:52,844
确保它没有过热
Make sure it's not overheating.

247
00:18:52,844 --> 00:18:55,073
斯科特先生，面板显示正确
Mr. Scott, the board shows correct.

248
00:18:55,405 --> 00:18:57,978
- 我没有让你检查面板  - 是的，长官
- I didn't ask you to check the board, lad. - Yes, sir.

249
00:19:17,763 --> 00:19:18,533
你是谁？
Who are you?

250
00:19:20,602 --> 00:19:25,654
我的名字并不重要，你叫沃特金斯，约翰B
My name is not important. Yours is Watkins, John B.

251
00:19:26,311 --> 00:19:29,458
- 4级轮机员  - 你对我了如指掌
- Engineer Grade 4. - You know all about me.

252
00:19:30,038 --> 00:19:31,634
我以前从未见过你
I've never seen you before.

253
00:19:32,892 --> 00:19:36,085
给我展示这个装置，我想学习
Show me this unit. I wish to learn.

254
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:42,099
这是物质-反物质积分器控制
This is a matter-antimatter integrator control.

255
00:19:42,194 --> 00:19:43,477
那是切断开关
That's the cutoff switch.

256
00:19:43,775 --> 00:19:45,213
不对
Not correct.

257
00:19:48,391 --> 00:19:53,815
那是紧急过载旁路，它瞬间就能启动
That is the emergency overload bypass, which engages almost instantaneously.

258
00:19:55,003 --> 00:19:59,757
明智的预防措施，因为反物质需要更长的时间才能爆炸
A wise precaution considering it takes the antimatter longer to explode

259
00:20:00,321 --> 00:20:03,515
一旦磁流失效
once the magnetic flow fails.

260
00:20:07,935 --> 00:20:09,916
我是来找你的，沃特金斯先生
I am for you, Mr. Watkins.

261
00:20:11,703 --> 00:20:15,597
斯科特先生，一个陌生的女人知道企业号的完整计划
Mr. Scott, a strange woman knows the entire plan of the Enterprise.

262
00:20:16,153 --> 00:20:18,155
[尖叫] 
[SCREAM] 

263
00:20:27,227 --> 00:20:29,091
哦，可怜的家伙
Oh, you poor lad.

264
00:20:31,918 --> 00:20:33,773
斯科特呼叫舰桥，斯科特呼叫舰桥
Scott to bridge. Scott to bridge.

265
00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:35,107
我是史波克
Spock here.

266
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:37,987
我的助手沃特金斯死了！
My assistant, Watkins, is dead!

267
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:40,713
你知道他为什么死吗，斯科特先生？
Do you know what he died of, Mr. Scott?

268
00:20:40,914 --> 00:20:45,442
我没看到，但他最后的话是关于一个陌生女人的
I didn't see it, but his last words were about a strange woman.

269
00:20:47,517 --> 00:20:51,396
安全警报，女性入侵者，极其危险
Security alert，all decks. Female intruder, extremely dangerous.

270
00:20:51,563 --> 00:20:53,861
安全警报，所有甲板
Security alert, all decks.

271
00:20:57,018 --> 00:20:57,947
结论
Conclusions.

272
00:20:58,173 --> 00:21:02,095
这颗行星的物质是双燃锇合金
The basic substance of this planet is an alloy of diburnium-osmium.

273
00:21:02,275 --> 00:21:03,936
它不可能是自然进化的
It couldn't have evolved naturally.

274
00:21:04,262 --> 00:21:07,737
舰长，这说不通，事实上，这里的东西都说不通
Captain, it doesn't make sense. In fact, othing about this planet makes sense.

275
00:21:07,737 --> 00:21:14,085
除了瞬间的波动，这颗行星没有磁场
Except for momentary fluctuations, this planet has no magnetic field.

276
00:21:14,226 --> 00:21:16,896
这些岩石的表观年龄只有几千年
The apparent age of these rocks is only a few thousand years.

277
00:21:17,091 --> 00:21:22,096
没有任何已知的过程可以在这么短的时间内进化出他们这里的植物生命
No known process could evolve the plant life they have here in that short space of time.

278
00:21:22,385 --> 00:21:25,055
你是说这可能是一颗人造星球？
Are you suggesting this might be an artificial planet?

279
00:21:25,146 --> 00:21:26,696
但是创造它的人在哪里？
But Captain where are the people who made it?

280
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:28,056
为什么我们看不到他们？
Why can't we see them?

281
00:21:29,135 --> 00:21:30,320
这个星球可能是空心的
The planet may be hollow.

282
00:21:30,628 --> 00:21:33,787
他们可能保护自己免受我们的传感器探头的影响
They might be shielding themselves from our sensor probes.

283
00:21:34,391 --> 00:21:36,080
天黑了，我们休息一下吧
It's dark. Let's get some rest.

284
00:21:36,388 --> 00:21:38,902
明天我们必须找到食物和水
Tomorrow we have to find food and water

285
00:21:38,902 --> 00:21:40,904
否则将是一次很不愉快的逗留
or it's going to be a very unpleasant stay.

286
00:21:41,071 --> 00:21:41,994
珍惜现在
While it lasts.

287
00:21:42,113 --> 00:21:43,447
我来值第一班
I'll take the first watch.

288
00:21:43,848 --> 00:21:47,908
好的，将达马托的三录仪设置为自动呼救
All right, set D'Amato's tricorder for automatic distress.

289
00:21:48,191 --> 00:21:50,111
- 防患于未然  - 是的，长官
- You never can tell. - Aye, sir.

290
00:22:02,925 --> 00:22:05,761
[哔哔] 
[BLEEPING] 

291
00:22:16,719 --> 00:22:20,101
史波克呼叫医务室，你完成沃特金斯的尸检了吗，医生？
Spock to Sickbay. Have you completed the autopsy on Watkins, doctor?

292
00:22:20,334 --> 00:22:21,457
[姆本加] 是的，完成了，史波克先生
[M'Benga] Yes, we have, Mr. Spock.

293
00:22:21,627 --> 00:22:25,606
他的死因和传送人员一样吗？
Was the cause of his death the same as that which killed the transporter officer?

294
00:22:26,114 --> 00:22:28,702
细胞破裂的模式是相同的
The pattern of of cellular disruption was the same.

295
00:22:28,952 --> 00:22:32,289
但至于原因，你的猜测和我的一样
But as to the cause, your guess is as good as mine.

296
00:22:33,623 --> 00:22:36,879
医生，我的猜测毫无价值
My guess, Doctor, would be valueless.

297
00:22:37,168 --> 00:22:41,109
不要猜测，找出一些事实，通话完毕
I suggest we refrain from guessing and find some facts. Spock out.

298
00:22:44,431 --> 00:22:50,618
入侵者破坏身体每一个细胞的力量
The power of this intruder to disrupt every cell in a body,

299
00:22:51,057 --> 00:22:56,646
加上将企业号扔出这么远的距离所需的力量
combined with the power required to hurl the Enterprise such a distance,

300
00:22:57,383 --> 00:23:01,026
都说明了一种非常高的文化和非常大的危险
speak of a very high culture and a very great danger.

301
00:23:01,192 --> 00:23:05,822
你是说把我们扔到1000光年外的人
You mean that one of the people that threw us 1,000 light years away from that planet

302
00:23:05,822 --> 00:23:08,127
在船上并且在杀人？
is on board and killing our people?

303
00:23:08,672 --> 00:23:10,402
一个合理的假设，斯科特先生
A reasonable assumption, Mr. Scott.

304
00:23:10,967 --> 00:23:14,684
那么你是对的，史波克先生，沃特金斯一定是被谋杀了
Then you're right, Mr. Spock. Watkins must have been murdered.

305
00:23:15,181 --> 00:23:17,882
我派他去检查物质-反物质反应堆
I sent him in to check the matter-antimatter reactor.

306
00:23:18,087 --> 00:23:20,105
那里没有暴露的电路
There are no exposed circuits there.

307
00:23:20,408 --> 00:23:22,362
不可能是他碰过的东西
It couldn't have been anything he touched.

308
00:23:22,839 --> 00:23:26,176
如果那个星球上有更多这样的生物
If there are more of those beings on that planet,

309
00:23:26,635 --> 00:23:30,347
舰长和其他人处于非常危险的境地
the captain and the others are in very great danger.

310
00:23:39,762 --> 00:23:41,153
我没有武器
I am unarmed.

311
00:23:43,335 --> 00:23:44,392
你是谁？
Who are you?

312
00:23:44,834 --> 00:23:46,271
那不重要
That is not important.

313
00:23:49,824 --> 00:23:51,297
你是苏鲁上尉
You are Lieutenant Sulu.

314
00:23:51,523 --> 00:23:53,094
你出生在地球上
You were born on the planet Earth.

315
00:23:53,411 --> 00:23:55,227
你是企业号的舵手
You are helmsman for the Enterprise.

316
00:23:55,769 --> 00:23:58,176
你怎么知道？你从哪儿弄的信息？
How do you know? Where did you get this information?

317
00:23:58,418 --> 00:23:59,603
你来自这个星球吗？
Are you from this planet?

318
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,421
我来自这里
I am from here.

319
00:24:01,628 --> 00:24:03,320
那么行星确实是空心的
Then the planet is hollow.

320
00:24:03,695 --> 00:24:05,158
谁杀死了达马托上尉？
Who killed Lieutenant D'Amato?

321
00:24:07,597 --> 00:24:10,850
舰长会想和你谈谈的，那边
All right, the captain wanna talk to you. That way.

322
00:24:12,741 --> 00:24:13,384
走
Move.

323
00:24:15,141 --> 00:24:19,984
你不明白，我是来找你的
You do not understand. I have come for you.

324
00:24:21,064 --> 00:24:21,986
你想要什么？
What do you want?

325
00:24:22,592 --> 00:24:25,185
我想…碰你
I want... to touch you.

326
00:24:27,362 --> 00:24:28,604
你之前在企业号上
You were on the Enterprise.

327
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:33,814
靠后！停下，否则我就开枪！
Keep back! Stop or I'll shoot!

328
00:24:34,122 --> 00:24:35,488
我不想杀女人
I don't want to have to kill a woman.

329
00:24:49,759 --> 00:24:52,125
柯克舰长！柯克舰长！
Captain Kirk! Captain Kirk!

330
00:24:59,981 --> 00:25:01,816
[苏鲁大喊] 
[SULU SHOUTS] 

331
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:03,564
别动
Hold it.

332
00:25:04,976 --> 00:25:05,900
你是谁？
Who are you?

333
00:25:06,855 --> 00:25:09,279
我来找他，我来找苏鲁上尉
I am for him. I am for Lieutenant Sulu.

334
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:10,726
不要让她碰你，舰长！
Don't let her touch you, Captain!

335
00:25:10,823 --> 00:25:12,019
达马托就是这样死的
That's how D'Amato died.

336
00:25:12,122 --> 00:25:13,190
相位枪不能阻止她
Phasers won't stop her.

337
00:25:13,825 --> 00:25:17,330
我来找苏鲁上尉，拜托，我必须碰他
I am for Lieutenant Sulu. Please. I must touch him.

338
00:25:26,296 --> 00:25:29,007
为什么你能毁灭别人但不是我？
How can you destroy others and not me?

339
00:25:29,174 --> 00:25:32,950
我不想毁灭，我不想
I don't want to destroy. I don't want to.

340
00:25:33,386 --> 00:25:36,415
你是谁？你为什么要杀我们？
Who are you? Why are you trying to kill us?

341
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:39,418
只要苏鲁
Only Sulu.

342
00:25:41,978 --> 00:25:43,915
我不会伤害你的
I mean you no harm.

343
00:25:46,107 --> 00:25:48,351
这个星球上有人吗？
Are there men on this planet?

344
00:25:49,819 --> 00:25:54,157
拜托，我一定要碰他，我来找苏鲁上尉
Please, I must touch him. I am for Lieutenant Sulu.

345
00:25:54,324 --> 00:25:56,326
不！
No!

346
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:08,706
老骨头，你看到了吗？
Bones, did you see that?

347
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:14,997
也许史波克错了，或许这是一个幽灵星球
Maybe Spock was wrong. Perhaps this is a ghost planet.

348
00:26:15,349 --> 00:26:18,519
我只知道她差点把苏鲁变成鬼魂
All I know is she almost made a ghost out of Sulu.

349
00:26:18,624 --> 00:26:22,433
他肩膀上，她碰过的地方，每个细胞都从内部炸开了
His shoulder, where she touched it, every cell's been disrupted, exploded from within.

350
00:26:23,019 --> 00:26:24,953
如果她紧紧地抓住了他…
If she'd gotten a good grip on him, Jim...

351
00:26:24,953 --> 00:26:27,536
人怎么能，舰长？
How can such people be, Captain?

352
00:26:28,696 --> 00:26:34,201
如此邪恶，她真…真漂亮
Such evil, and she's so... so beautiful.

353
00:26:35,031 --> 00:26:36,531
是的，我知道
Yes, I know.

354
00:26:45,704 --> 00:26:50,350
所有甲板的安全扫描都没有情况，史波克先生，没有入侵者的证据
Security sweeps of all decks are negative, Mr. Spock. No evidence of intruder.

355
00:26:50,547 --> 00:26:53,461
很好，取消红色警报但维持更强的安全措施
Very well. Cancel Red Alert but maintain increased security.

356
00:26:53,461 --> 00:26:54,061
是的，长官
Aye, sir.

357
00:26:54,717 --> 00:26:58,082
所有甲板取消红色警报，维持更强的安全措施
All decks, cancel Red Alert. Maintain increased security.

358
00:26:58,759 --> 00:27:04,011
更新我们对星际舰队的报告以包括安全搜索，结果没有情况
Update our report to Starfleet to include security search, results negative.

359
00:27:04,843 --> 00:27:06,465
她是怎么下船的，长官？
How did she get off the ship, sir?

360
00:27:06,984 --> 00:27:09,073
大概和她上船的方式一样
Presumably the same way she got on.

361
00:27:09,638 --> 00:27:10,973
是的，长官
Yes, sir.

362
00:27:11,568 --> 00:27:17,532
史波克先生，舰长和其他人还活着的几率有多大？
Mr. Spock, what are the chances of the captain and the others being alive?

363
00:27:18,658 --> 00:27:20,814
上尉，我们不参与赌博
Lieutenant, we are not engaged in gambling.

364
00:27:20,988 --> 00:27:23,150
我们正在以合乎逻辑的方式继续
We are proceeding in the logical way

365
00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:26,671
回到最后一次见到他们的地方，并实际确定
to return to the place they were last seen and factually ascertain

366
00:27:26,671 --> 00:27:29,007
他们是否还活着
whether or not they still live.

367
00:27:31,337 --> 00:27:32,514
是的，史波克先生
Yes, Mr. Spock.

368
00:27:32,986 --> 00:27:36,636
史波克先生，速度提高到了曲速8.8
Mr. Spock, speed has increased to warp 8.8.

369
00:27:38,136 --> 00:27:39,121
轮机部呼叫舰桥
Bridge to engineering.

370
00:27:39,182 --> 00:27:40,846
我是斯科提，我看到了
Scotty here. I see it.

371
00:27:41,598 --> 00:27:43,469
能量激增，我正在努力
It's a power surge. I'm working on it.

372
00:27:43,659 --> 00:27:45,764
减速，直到我找到问题所在
Reduce speed till I locate the trouble.

373
00:27:46,102 --> 00:27:48,110
很好，减速至曲速7
Very well. Reduce speed to warp 7.

374
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:49,696
是的，长官，曲速7
Aye, sir. Warp 7.

375
00:27:51,236 --> 00:27:56,139
史波克先生，我们的速度已增加到曲速8.9并且仍在攀升
Mr. Spock. Our speed has increased to warp 8.9 and still climbing.

376
00:27:57,155 --> 00:27:58,239
舰桥呼叫轮机部
Bridge to engineering.

377
00:27:58,239 --> 00:27:59,845
无法减速
Negative effect on power reduction.

378
00:27:59,845 --> 00:28:01,242
速度还在增加
Speed is still increasing.

379
00:28:05,025 --> 00:28:08,189
是的，史波克先生，我已经找到原因了
Aye, Mr. Spock, and I've found out why.

380
00:28:09,153 --> 00:28:13,126
物质-反物质积分器的紧急旁路控制已熔断
The emergency bypass control of the matter-antimatter integrator is fused.

381
00:28:13,381 --> 00:28:14,944
完全没用了
It's completely useless.

382
00:28:14,944 --> 00:28:18,009
引擎疯狂运转，没有办法对付他们
The engines are running wild. There's no way to get at them.

383
00:28:18,414 --> 00:28:21,017
我们将在15分钟内达到最大过载
Except reach maximum overload in 15 minutes.

384
00:28:21,304 --> 00:28:25,350
我会算14.87分钟，斯科特先生
I would calculate 14.87 minutes, Mr. Scott.

385
00:28:26,392 --> 00:28:29,646
那几秒钟不会有任何区别
Those few seconds will not make any difference,

386
00:28:29,646 --> 00:28:34,529
因为你我和其余船员将不再在这里来回穿梭
because you and I and the rest of the crew will no longer be here to bandy it back and forth.

387
00:28:35,212 --> 00:28:37,337
这东西要爆炸了
This thing is going to blow up.

388
00:28:39,322 --> 00:28:41,613
宇宙中没有任何东西可以阻止它
And there's nothing in the universe can stop it.

389
00:28:54,802 --> 00:28:58,113
有一层几个细胞厚的坏死组织
There's a layer of necrotic tissue a few cells thick.

390
00:28:59,425 --> 00:29:01,014
正常的伤口会很快愈合
A normal wound would heal quickly.

391
00:29:01,609 --> 00:29:03,565
她只是…碰了我
She just... touched me.

392
00:29:04,347 --> 00:29:05,947
怎么会这么快？
How could it happen so fast?

393
00:29:06,183 --> 00:29:07,595
这是个好问题
That's a good question.

394
00:29:08,685 --> 00:29:12,378
她触到了传送长官，他立刻倒下了
She touched the transporter chief and he collapsed immediately.

395
00:29:13,231 --> 00:29:14,649
她显然碰到了达马托
She apparently got to D'Amato.

396
00:29:14,967 --> 00:29:16,079
我们看到了他的遭遇
We saw what happened to him.

397
00:29:16,666 --> 00:29:19,941
问题是，你为什么活着？
The question is, why are you alive?

398
00:29:20,285 --> 00:29:22,467
舰长，我很高兴是这个结果
Captain, I'm happy the way it turned out.

399
00:29:23,866 --> 00:29:24,725
吉姆
Jim.

400
00:29:26,677 --> 00:29:28,501
她必须拥有什么样的力量？
What kind of power must she have?

401
00:29:29,090 --> 00:29:32,341
完全破坏生物细胞结构的能力
The power to totally disrupt biological cell structure.

402
00:29:33,376 --> 00:29:35,477
苏鲁还活着是因为我介入了
Sulu's alive because I intervened.

403
00:29:36,056 --> 00:29:37,909
但这提出了一个更糟糕的问题
But that raises an even worse question.

404
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:38,910
是的
Yes.

405
00:29:40,189 --> 00:29:41,647
她为什么不杀你？
Why didn't she kill you?

406
00:29:44,896 --> 00:29:46,031
她还没有完成
She's not through yet.

407
00:29:56,950 --> 00:30:00,203
没用的，毫无疑问，这是故意的
It's useless. And there is no question, it's deliberate.

408
00:30:00,486 --> 00:30:01,196
蓄意破坏
Sabotage.

409
00:30:01,196 --> 00:30:03,003
是的，缜密的工作
Aye. And a thorough job.

410
00:30:03,219 --> 00:30:04,740
系统不会出错
The system's foolproof.

411
00:30:04,918 --> 00:30:07,249
谋杀沃特金斯的人破坏了它
Whoever murdered Watkins sabotaged it.

412
00:30:09,203 --> 00:30:11,598
你说它被熔断了，怎么做的？
You said it was fused. How?

413
00:30:11,777 --> 00:30:12,942
那就是困扰我的事
That's what worries me.

414
00:30:13,045 --> 00:30:14,266
“困扰”，斯科特先生？
"Worries," Mr. Scott?

415
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:16,191
嗯，它是熔断了
Well, it's fused,

416
00:30:16,191 --> 00:30:19,734
但做到这一点需要我们相位炮台的所有能量
but it would take all the power of our phaser banks to do it.

417
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:21,130
有趣
Interesting.

418
00:30:22,301 --> 00:30:25,512
我不觉得我们即将爆炸的事实有趣
I find nothing interesting in the fact we're about to blow up.

419
00:30:25,756 --> 00:30:29,552
不，但是方法很吸引人
No. But the method is fascinating.

420
00:30:31,403 --> 00:30:34,236
干了这事的东西仍然在这艘船上
Whatever did this is still aboard this ship.

421
00:30:34,904 --> 00:30:38,365
我不理解你为什么取消安全警报
I fail to understand why you cancelled the security alert.

422
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:42,471
一种可以将我们抛向990.7光年之外的力量
A force that could hurl us 990.7 light years away

423
00:30:42,728 --> 00:30:46,780
并且仍然能够破坏我们的主要能源
and at that distance still be able to sabotage our main source of energy

424
00:30:47,014 --> 00:30:49,532
不会坐以待毙
will not be waiting around to be taken into custody.

425
00:30:49,674 --> 00:30:50,413
也是
Aye.

426
00:30:51,239 --> 00:30:53,257
当我回忆起我们燃料流的模式时
As I recall the pattern of our fuel flow,

427
00:30:53,257 --> 00:30:56,753
有一根通向物质-反物质反应室的管道
there is an access tube leading to the matter-antimatter reaction chamber.

428
00:30:56,933 --> 00:30:59,017
有一条爬行通道
There's a service crawlway,

429
00:30:59,017 --> 00:31:01,681
但它不适合在积分器运行时使用
but it's not meant to be used while the integrator operates.

430
00:31:01,681 --> 00:31:02,980
然而，它还在
Still, it is there.

431
00:31:03,072 --> 00:31:05,870
也许可以在那里切断燃料的流动
And it might be possible to shut off the flow of fuel at that point.

432
00:31:06,312 --> 00:31:08,437
用什么？空手？
What with? Bare hands?

433
00:31:09,767 --> 00:31:11,276
一个磁性探头
A magnetic probe.

434
00:31:12,688 --> 00:31:17,563
任何与反物质接触的物质都会引发爆炸
Any matter that comes in contact with antimatter triggers the explosion.

435
00:31:17,772 --> 00:31:21,010
我不确定人能不能在爬行通道里活下来
And I'm not even sure a man can live in a crawlway

436
00:31:21,010 --> 00:31:24,829
在装着反物质的磁场的能量流中
in the energy stream of the magnetic field that bottles up the antimatter.

437
00:31:25,235 --> 00:31:26,482
我会试试的
I shall try.

438
00:31:27,386 --> 00:31:28,818
你会被杀的，兄弟
You'll be killed, man.

439
00:31:29,158 --> 00:31:31,026
除非迅速找到解决办法
Unless a solution is found quickly,

440
00:31:31,118 --> 00:31:33,156
否则我们所有人都会死
that fate awaits all of us.

441
00:31:33,972 --> 00:31:37,990
是的，你说得对，我们有什么能失去的呢？
Aye. You're right. What have we got to lose?

442
00:31:38,387 --> 00:31:40,292
但我来做吧，史波克先生
But I'll do it, Mr. Spock.

443
00:31:40,353 --> 00:31:42,504
我对那个系统了如指掌
I know every millimeter of that system.

444
00:31:42,504 --> 00:31:44,096
 我会做该做的事
I'll do whatever has to be done. 

445
00:31:44,199 --> 00:31:45,462
很好，斯科特先生
Very well, Mr. Scott.

446
00:31:45,667 --> 00:31:48,753
你谈到了船出错的感觉
You spoke of the feel of the ship being wrong.

447
00:31:49,178 --> 00:31:54,183
是的，这是一个情绪化的陈述，我不指望你能理解
Aye. It was an emotional statement. I don't expect you to understand it.

448
00:31:54,810 --> 00:31:58,504
斯科特先生，我注意到了这一点，但不一定理解它
I note it, Mr. Scott, without necessarily understanding it.

449
00:31:58,814 --> 00:32:01,951
我会用计算机进行分析
I propose to run an analysis through the ship's computers,

450
00:32:01,951 --> 00:32:06,048
比较企业号的现状与她的理想状态
comparing the present condition of the Enterprise with her ideal condition.

451
00:32:06,048 --> 00:32:08,409
我们没有时间这样做  
Mr. Spock, we don't have time for that.

452
00:32:08,409 --> 00:32:10,755
我们有12分27秒
We have 12 minutes and 27 seconds.

453
00:32:10,755 --> 00:32:15,407
在我学习计算机的同时，在爬行通道里尽你所能
I suggest you do whatever you can in the service crawlway while I make the computer study.

454
00:32:19,416 --> 00:32:21,449
你觉得足够强壮可以走动吗？
Lieutenant Sulu, do you feel strong enough to move on?

455
00:32:21,767 --> 00:32:22,742
我感觉很好，舰长  
I feel fine, Captain.

456
00:32:22,742 --> 00:32:23,436
是吗，老骨头？  
Is he, Bones?

457
00:32:23,810 --> 00:32:24,842
他的状态还不错
He's in fair shape.

458
00:32:25,131 --> 00:32:26,716
好的
All right.

459
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:32,214
无论这个女人有多大破坏力她似乎每次只针对一个人
Whatever destructive power this woman has seems to be aimed at one specific person at one specific time.

460
00:32:33,431 --> 00:32:34,909
如果我没猜错，当她再次出现时
If I'm correct, when she reappears,

461
00:32:34,909 --> 00:32:37,363
另外两个也许能保护她追捕的人
the other two might be able to protect the one she's after

462
00:32:37,363 --> 00:32:38,899
挡在他们之间
by interposing their bodies.

463
00:32:39,181 --> 00:32:40,295
似乎没有武器能伤到她
No weapons seem to affect her.

464
00:32:40,531 --> 00:32:42,259
她怎么认识我们的？
Captain, how does she know about us?

465
00:32:42,487 --> 00:32:43,621
她会读心术吗？
Does she read our minds?

466
00:32:44,309 --> 00:32:45,519
相位枪过载！  
Phaser on overload!

467
00:32:46,250 --> 00:32:47,569
控制器熔断了，扔掉！
Controls are fused. Droped!

468
00:32:57,328 --> 00:32:59,582
显然，她可以摧毁我们的武器
Apparently she can destroy our weapons

469
00:33:00,496 --> 00:33:01,599
就像摧毁我们一样
as well as destroy us.

470
00:33:01,882 --> 00:33:02,705
快点，我们走
Come on. Let's go.

471
00:33:10,732 --> 00:33:13,103
好的，小伙子们，打开爬行通道门
All right, lads. Get the crawlway door open.

472
00:33:13,330 --> 00:33:14,326
把工具递给我
Hand me the tools.

473
00:33:18,476 --> 00:33:21,646
通讯器，好的，头先进
Communicator. All right. Head first.

474
00:33:21,812 --> 00:33:24,532
我希望史波克先生知道他在做什么
I hope Mr. Spock knows what he's doing.

475
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,357
斯科特呼叫舰桥
Scott to bridge.

476
00:33:59,015 --> 00:34:00,295
[史波克] 请讲，斯科特先生
[Spock] Go ahead, Mr. Scott.

477
00:34:00,411 --> 00:34:03,425
我已经封锁了爬行通道的尾端
I've sealed off the aft end of the crawlway

478
00:34:03,425 --> 00:34:05,731
并放置了爆炸分离炸药
and positioned explosive separator charges

479
00:34:05,731 --> 00:34:08,737
如果我打破了磁性瓶，就把我轰出飞船
to blast me clear of the ship if I rupture the magnetic bottle.

480
00:34:09,819 --> 00:34:15,457
我现在非常接近磁流，感觉就像蚂蚁在我的全身爬行
I'm so close to the flow now it feels like ants crawling all over my body.

481
00:34:16,598 --> 00:34:20,643
斯科特先生，我建议你避免更多的主观描述
Mr. Scott, I suggest you refrain from any further subjective descriptions.

482
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:24,412
你有10分19秒的时间来执行你的任务
You now have 10 minutes and 19 seconds in which to perform your task.

483
00:34:24,663 --> 00:34:28,208
[拉达] 史波克先生，我们在曲速11.2并且不断加速
[Radha] Mr. Spock. We're at warp 11.2 and accelerating.

484
00:34:28,754 --> 00:34:33,169
我听到了，这艘船的结构不能承受这种速度
I heard that. The ship's not structured to take that speed for any length of time.

485
00:34:35,970 --> 00:34:39,055
你现在有10分10秒
You now have 10 minutes and 10 seconds.

486
00:34:47,308 --> 00:34:52,943
好的，史波克先生，我正开始打开检修板
All right, Mr. Spock. I'm starting to open the access panel now.

487
00:34:53,404 --> 00:34:55,285
磁流的入口
Access to the flow itself.

488
00:34:55,393 --> 00:34:59,495
如果磁流跳跃，你必须抛弃我
If the magnetic flow jumps, you must jettison me.

489
00:35:00,494 --> 00:35:05,124
安全控制不会坚持超过两秒
The safety control will not hold more than two seconds

490
00:35:05,291 --> 00:35:07,078
如果我破坏了场
if I rupture the field.

491
00:35:07,755 --> 00:35:11,110
我知道这些事实，请继续工作
I'm aware of these facts. Please get on with the job.

492
00:35:12,227 --> 00:35:12,807
计算机
Computer.

493
00:35:12,807 --> 00:35:13,556
工作中
Working.

494
00:35:13,556 --> 00:35:15,943
分析我的对比坐标
Analysis on my comparison coordinates.

495
00:35:16,893 --> 00:35:18,393
[计算机] 无法运行
[Computer] Unable to comply.

496
00:35:18,393 --> 00:35:21,945
对比坐标太复杂，无法立即读出
Comparison coordinates too complex for immediate read-out.

497
00:35:21,945 --> 00:35:24,213
将在完成后通知
Will advise upon completion.

498
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:51,097
我已卸下检修板
I've removed the access plate

499
00:35:51,962 --> 00:35:55,168
我看到电荷在仪器上跳跃
and I've got static electric charges dancing on the instruments.

500
00:35:56,342 --> 00:35:59,072
看起来那里面像有极光
Looks like an aurora borealis in there.

501
00:36:00,186 --> 00:36:02,855
乌乎拉上尉，你在监测磁力？  
Lieutenant Uhura, you are monitoring the magnetic force?

502
00:36:02,855 --> 00:36:03,564
是的，长官
Yes, sir.

503
00:36:03,564 --> 00:36:05,704
一定不要开小差
Please do not take your eyes off it.

504
00:36:05,704 --> 00:36:06,304
是的，长官
Aye, sir.

505
00:36:06,454 --> 00:36:09,965
拉达上尉，装备分离仓抛弃系统
Lieutenant Radha, arm the pod jettison system.

506
00:36:10,068 --> 00:36:10,746
是的，长官
Aye, sir.

507
00:36:11,121 --> 00:36:13,201
有问题我会立即抛弃
I'll jettison at the first sign of trouble.

508
00:36:13,390 --> 00:36:15,654
我下令再执行
Not until my order.

509
00:36:16,075 --> 00:36:16,875
是的，长官
Yes, sir.

510
00:36:17,676 --> 00:36:20,033
曲速11.9
Warp 11.9.

511
00:36:26,717 --> 00:36:28,832
斯科特先生，你的情况如何？  
Mr. Scott, what is your situation?

512
00:36:30,033 --> 00:36:31,429
很难说
It's hard to see.

513
00:36:32,092 --> 00:36:36,138
有太多的干扰，任何接近磁流的尝试
There's so much disturbance that any attempt to get at the flow

514
00:36:36,138 --> 00:36:38,324
都会破坏磁场
would rupture the magnetic field.

515
00:36:40,803 --> 00:36:44,705
你有8分41秒
You have 8 minutes, 41 seconds.

516
00:36:45,018 --> 00:36:49,183
我知道时间，我不需要报时的布谷鸟钟
I know what time it is. I don't need a bloomin' cuckoo clock.

517
00:36:51,605 --> 00:36:55,517
舰长，我又遇到了那种奇怪的磁性扫描，从0到超出范围
Captain, I'm getting that strange magnetic sweep again, from zero to off the scale.

518
00:36:55,517 --> 00:36:56,402
是的
Yes.

519
00:36:57,736 --> 00:37:00,471
就像一扇门…打开…
Like a door... opening...

520
00:37:08,664 --> 00:37:09,834
你这次来找谁？  
Who have you come for this time?

521
00:37:10,286 --> 00:37:11,996
找你，詹姆斯·T·柯克
For you, James T. Kirk.

522
00:37:12,545 --> 00:37:13,934
企业号的指挥官
Commander of the Enterprise.

523
00:37:29,018 --> 00:37:29,969
躲在我们身后，吉姆
Keep behind us, Jim.

524
00:37:33,958 --> 00:37:34,954
你为什么要杀我们？  
Why do you wanna kill us?

525
00:37:35,077 --> 00:37:36,017
为了防御
For defense.

526
00:37:37,007 --> 00:37:39,965
你是詹姆斯·T·柯克舰长，企业号的指挥官
You are Captain James T. Kirk, commander of the Enterprise.

527
00:37:40,098 --> 00:37:41,130
那么你为什么要杀我？
Then why do you wanna kill me?

528
00:37:41,433 --> 00:37:42,033
你是入侵者
You are an invader.

529
00:37:45,914 --> 00:37:49,417
我们在这执行和平任务，是你杀了我们的人
We're here on a peaceful mission. It's you who have killed our people.

530
00:37:49,513 --> 00:37:51,950
我们无意伤害，我们想平静地离开
We mean no harm to you. We want to leave peacefully.

531
00:37:52,316 --> 00:37:54,775
舰长，没有生命形式显示
Captain, I'm getting no life-form register.

532
00:37:55,314 --> 00:37:56,038
机器人？  
An android?

533
00:37:56,228 --> 00:37:58,605
那会给出机械读数，我什么都没读到
That would give a mechanical reading. I'm getting nothing.

534
00:38:07,431 --> 00:38:08,152
你是谁？  
Who are you?

535
00:38:09,981 --> 00:38:13,062
我是洛西拉，指挥官
I am Losira, Commander.

536
00:38:13,062 --> 00:38:14,201
什么的指挥官？
Commander of what?

537
00:38:14,437 --> 00:38:15,854
这个站
Of this station.

538
00:38:16,065 --> 00:38:18,888
站？哪里有站？
Station? Station, where?

539
00:38:23,447 --> 00:38:25,037
杀死我的感觉怎么样？  
How do you feel about killing me?

540
00:38:25,731 --> 00:38:26,512
感觉？
Feel?

541
00:38:28,577 --> 00:38:30,959
杀戮…是错误的
Killing... is wrong.

542
00:38:31,676 --> 00:38:32,354
躲在我们中间！
Stay between us!

543
00:38:32,498 --> 00:38:34,849
你不能进入这个站！
You must not penetrate this station!

544
00:38:35,249 --> 00:38:36,666
拜托，我必须碰你！
Please, I must touch you!

545
00:38:38,295 --> 00:38:39,521
你要杀我？
You want to kill me?

546
00:38:40,624 --> 00:38:41,224
不
No.

547
00:38:43,008 --> 00:38:44,279
那为什么要这样做，如果你不想？  
Then why do it, if you don't want to?

548
00:38:45,296 --> 00:38:45,896
我…被派来
I am... sent.

549
00:38:49,765 --> 00:38:50,543
被谁？
By whom?

550
00:38:54,478 --> 00:38:55,912
我们保卫这个地方  
We defend this place.

551
00:38:56,795 --> 00:38:57,395
这个星球上还有其他人吗？
Are there others on this planet?

552
00:39:00,697 --> 00:39:06,119
他们…已经…不在了
They... are... no more.

553
00:39:11,370 --> 00:39:12,813
你一个人多久了？
How long have you been alone?

554
00:39:15,102 --> 00:39:15,883
你孤独吗？
Are you lonely?

555
00:39:32,788 --> 00:39:33,809
她一定在某个地方  
She must be somewhere.

556
00:39:33,938 --> 00:39:34,975
她没有显示
She's not registering.

557
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:45,988
还有这种能量激增，完全超出范围
And there's this power surge, right off the scale.

558
00:39:47,152 --> 00:39:48,692
就像关门一样
Like a door closing.

559
00:39:50,653 --> 00:39:51,901
应该就在这附近
It must be near here.

560
00:39:56,290 --> 00:39:58,107
能量水平仍然不变？  
Is the power level still holding?

561
00:39:58,159 --> 00:39:59,226
超出范围
Right off the scale.

562
00:39:59,801 --> 00:40:01,865
自从她消失以来，它一直处于峰值
It's remained at a peak since she disappeared.

563
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:07,776
入口在这里
The entrance is here.

564
00:40:19,587 --> 00:40:21,123
你认为我们是被邀请进来的？
You think we're being invited in?

565
00:40:22,641 --> 00:40:23,612
无疑看起来像，
It certainly looks like it.

566
00:40:24,556 --> 00:40:27,133
邀请并没有让我完全放松
And the invitation doesn't exactly relax me.

567
00:40:27,696 --> 00:40:29,454
我宁愿在企业号上
I'd rather be on the Enterprise.

568
00:40:30,321 --> 00:40:31,358
我同意
I agree.

569
00:40:31,909 --> 00:40:33,737
我们被带到这里，为什么？
We've been led here. Why?

570
00:40:36,121 --> 00:40:36,964
我不知道
I don't know.

571
00:40:38,633 --> 00:40:42,595
但是无论这个星球上存在什么文明都在那里面
But whatever civilization exists on this planet is in there.

572
00:40:43,669 --> 00:40:47,560
而且没有企业号，先生们，食物和水的唯一来源
And without the Enterprise, gentlemen, the only source of food and water

573
00:40:48,383 --> 00:40:50,661
也在那里面
is in there.

574
00:40:52,448 --> 00:40:53,233
我们走
Let's go.

575
00:41:13,650 --> 00:41:14,961
电脑读出
Computer read-out.

576
00:41:15,122 --> 00:41:17,381
[计算机] 对比分析完成
[Computer] Comparison analysis complete.

577
00:41:17,782 --> 00:41:19,200
继续
Continue.

578
00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:26,202
传送系数M7重组反相.0009
Transporter factor M7 reassembled out-phase .0009.

579
00:41:26,463 --> 00:41:28,419
还剩57秒，长官  
57 seconds to go, sir.

580
00:41:28,758 --> 00:41:29,734
了解
Understood.

581
00:41:29,862 --> 00:41:30,735
史波克先生 -   
Mr. Spock

582
00:41:31,428 --> 00:41:32,028
我是史波克
Spock here.

583
00:41:32,198 --> 00:41:34,554
我要试着切断磁流
I'm going to try to cut through the magnetic flow.

584
00:41:34,805 --> 00:41:39,643
但如果探头不能精确匹配磁流
But if the probe doesn't precisely match the magnetic flow,

585
00:41:39,719 --> 00:41:41,254
会爆炸
there will be an explosion.

586
00:41:45,530 --> 00:41:47,784
现在…开始
Starting right... now.

587
00:41:54,417 --> 00:41:56,475
磁力指示器跳跃  
Magnetic force indicator jumping, Mr. Spock.

588
00:41:56,598 --> 00:41:58,164
斯科特先生，放轻松
Mr. Scott, ease off.

589
00:42:03,837 --> 00:42:05,921
磁力已降至正常  
Magnetic force has dropped to normal, sir.

590
00:42:06,014 --> 00:42:07,323
曲速13.2，长官
Warp 13.2, sir.

591
00:42:07,462 --> 00:42:13,010
计算机，在反相情况下，逆转磁场会实现闭合吗？
Computer, for out-phase condition, will reverse field achieve closure?

592
00:42:13,010 --> 00:42:20,100
[电脑] 是的，如果M7系数保持不变
[Computer] Affirmative, if M7 factor maintained.

593
00:42:21,435 --> 00:42:25,032
斯科特先生，翻转你的磁性探头极性
Mr. Scott, reverse polarity on your magnetic probe.

594
00:42:25,208 --> 00:42:26,477
翻转极性？  
Reverse polarity?

595
00:42:26,477 --> 00:42:27,909
没错，斯科特先生  
That is correct, Mr. Scott.

596
00:42:27,909 --> 00:42:31,200
这需要做一些工作，它有什么目的…
That will take some doing. What purpose could it...

597
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:32,858
请开始，我会解释
Please commence. I'll explain.

598
00:42:32,858 --> 00:42:35,306
你的“感觉”是正确的
You were correct in your "feel".

599
00:42:35,466 --> 00:42:38,207
我们经历了一次传送
The Enterprise was put through a molecular transporter

600
00:42:38,207 --> 00:42:40,548
然后被反相重组了
and reassembled slightly out of phase.

601
00:42:40,779 --> 00:42:43,189
翻转极性应该会封上切口
Reverse polarity should seal the incision.

602
00:42:43,638 --> 00:42:45,767
我只希望你是对的
No time for theory, just hope you're right.

603
00:42:46,282 --> 00:42:47,930
[拉达] 20秒，史波克先生
[Radha] 20 seconds, Mr. Spock.

604
00:42:48,069 --> 00:42:49,286
我正在尽我所能
I'm doing the best I can.

605
00:42:49,506 --> 00:42:49,989
等等！
Wait!

606
00:42:53,947 --> 00:42:54,881
卡住了！
It's stuck!

607
00:43:04,492 --> 00:43:06,661
卡住了！按按钮！
It's stuck! Push the button!

608
00:43:06,730 --> 00:43:08,347
请继续  
Please continue.

609
00:43:08,362 --> 00:43:10,690
别傻了！按按钮！
Don't be a fool! Push the button!

610
00:43:10,776 --> 00:43:11,956
这是你最后的机会！
It's your last chance!

611
00:43:12,125 --> 00:43:13,753
不要感情用事，按按钮
Don't be sentimental. Push it!

612
00:43:13,932 --> 00:43:15,293
反正我会死
I'm gonna die anyway.

613
00:43:15,591 --> 00:43:17,064
请继续
Please continue.

614
00:43:24,451 --> 00:43:27,329
松开了！但是没时间了，按按钮！
It's loose! But there's no time. Push the button!

615
00:43:28,189 --> 00:43:31,834
9秒…8秒…7秒…
9 seconds... 8 seconds... 7 seconds...

616
00:43:31,983 --> 00:43:35,987
6秒…5秒…4秒…
6 seconds... 5 seconds... 4 seconds...

617
00:43:35,992 --> 00:43:39,185
3秒…2秒…1…
3 seconds... 2 seconds... 1...

618
00:43:39,930 --> 00:43:41,307
史波克先生，现在
Mr. Spock, now.

619
00:43:51,450 --> 00:43:53,344
曲速14.1…
Warp 14.1...

620
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:56,003
曲速14
Warp 14.

621
00:43:57,155 --> 00:44:00,075
磁力稳定
Magnetic forces steady.

622
00:44:03,832 --> 00:44:05,959
曲速13.9并且在下降
Warp 13.9 and dropping.

623
00:44:07,082 --> 00:44:09,608
斯科特先生，你已经完成了你的任务
Mr. Scott, you have accomplished your task.

624
00:44:10,085 --> 00:44:12,575
你至少可以说声谢谢
You might at least say thank you.

625
00:44:14,413 --> 00:44:17,534
为什么，斯科特先生？在你们人类身上…
For what purpose, Mr. Scott? What is it in you humans...

626
00:44:17,534 --> 00:44:18,710
算了
Never mind.

627
00:44:18,838 --> 00:44:21,898
有什么东西需要在这样的情况下表现出压倒性的情绪呢？
That requires an overwhelming display of emotion in a situation such as this?

628
00:44:22,764 --> 00:44:26,093
两个人采取唯一合理的行动方案
Two men pursue the only reasonable course of action indicated

629
00:44:26,467 --> 00:44:30,527
然而你觉得其他的东西是必要的
and yet you feel that something else is necessary.

630
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:56,709
你来找谁？
Who have you come for?

631
00:45:01,636 --> 00:45:04,473
围成圆圈
Form a circle.

632
00:45:07,142 --> 00:45:10,256
你看？你最好告诉我们
You see? You'd better tell us.

633
00:45:13,356 --> 00:45:16,234
告诉我们，你来找谁？
Tell us. Who have you come for?

634
00:45:17,527 --> 00:45:18,538
你来找谁？
Who have you come for?

635
00:45:26,166 --> 00:45:27,773
你是一位很坚决的女性，找我？  
You're a very determined woman. For me?

636
00:45:28,456 --> 00:45:30,443
我找詹姆斯T.柯克
I am for James T. Kirk.

637
00:45:31,833 --> 00:45:32,815
先生们，我需要你们的帮助
Gentlemen, I need your help.

638
00:45:33,744 --> 00:45:34,565
拜托
Please.

639
00:45:35,712 --> 00:45:38,975
我必须碰你，我求你了，这是我的生存方式
I must touch you. I beg it. It is my existence.

640
00:45:39,382 --> 00:45:41,290
我们已经看到了你触摸的后果
We've seen the results of your touch.

641
00:45:43,852 --> 00:45:46,937
但你是我匹配的人，詹姆斯·柯克，我必须碰你
But you are my match, James Kirk. I must touch you.

642
00:45:47,891 --> 00:45:51,673
然后我会像你一样活着，甚至复刻你的细胞结构
Then I will live as one, even to the structure of your cells,

643
00:45:51,933 --> 00:45:53,324
染色体的排列
the arrangement of chromosomes.

644
00:45:54,961 --> 00:45:56,214
这就是你杀人的方式
That is how you kill.

645
00:45:59,751 --> 00:46:00,639
你永远都碰不到我
You'll never reach me.

646
00:46:03,299 --> 00:46:03,889
小心！  
Watch out!

647
00:46:03,889 --> 00:46:04,895
我找麦考伊
I am for McCoy.

648
00:46:08,899 --> 00:46:11,918
那台计算机一定在编写这些复制品
That computer must be programming these replicas.

649
00:46:11,918 --> 00:46:12,069
那台计算机一定在编写这些复制品
她们碰到我们后与我们的染色体模式相匹配
她们碰到我们后与我们的染色体模式相匹配

650
00:46:12,069 --> 00:46:14,462
她们碰到我们后与我们的染色体模式相匹配
The women match our chromosome patterns after they touch us.

651
00:46:14,865 --> 00:46:16,436
我告诉你，那是一件很痛苦的事
It's a very painful affair. I can tell you.

652
00:46:17,765 --> 00:46:18,825
我找苏鲁  
I am for Sulu.

653
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:19,906
换位置
Shift positions.

654
00:46:20,769 --> 00:46:22,645
我们不能再互相保护了
Captain, we can no longer protect each other.

655
00:46:38,896 --> 00:46:41,649
史波克！电脑！破坏它！
Spock! The computer! Destroy it!

656
00:46:54,456 --> 00:46:56,966
史波克先生，很高兴见到你
Mr. Spock, I certainly am glad to see you.

657
00:46:56,966 --> 00:46:58,799
我以为你和企业号已经被摧毁了
I thought you and the Enterprise had been destroyed.

658
00:46:58,917 --> 00:47:01,253
我对你也有同样的担忧
I had the same misgivings about you, Captain.

659
00:47:01,376 --> 00:47:04,564
我们刚刚返回并读取了你的生命形式读数
We returned and picked up your life-form readings only a moment ago.

660
00:47:04,564 --> 00:47:05,360
从哪里返回？  
Returned from where?

661
00:47:06,222 --> 00:47:09,382
从大脑把企业号送去的地方：
From where this brain had the power to send the Enterprise:

662
00:47:09,718 --> 00:47:13,271
横跨银河系990.7光年
990.7 light years across the galaxy.

663
00:47:13,851 --> 00:47:15,530
这是多么了不起的文化
What a remarkable culture this is.

664
00:47:15,586 --> 00:47:18,281
曾是，史波克先生，它的防御是由计算机运行的
Was, Mr. Spock. Its defenses were run by computer.

665
00:47:18,718 --> 00:47:20,294
我猜到了，舰长
I surmised that, Captain.

666
00:47:20,531 --> 00:47:22,795
它的行为非常合乎逻辑
Its moves were immensely logical.

667
00:47:23,466 --> 00:47:24,971
但是什么人创造了这个？
But what people created this?

668
00:47:25,109 --> 00:47:26,655
这里有代表吗？
Are there any representatives here?

669
00:47:26,655 --> 00:47:28,883
有其中一个的复制品
There were replicas of one of them.

670
00:47:29,550 --> 00:47:31,768
但是创造他们的能量已经被摧毁了
But the power to recreate them has been destroyed.

671
00:47:32,461 --> 00:47:34,720
真是个损失，舰长
That is a loss, Captain.

672
00:47:34,930 --> 00:47:37,536
如果你和我们一起，你就不会这么想了
You wouldn't have thought so if you'd been among us.

673
00:47:42,497 --> 00:47:45,203
我的卡兰丹同伴，欢迎
My fellow Kalandans, welcome.

674
00:47:45,844 --> 00:47:48,791
一种疾病摧毁了我们，当心它
A disease has destroyed us. Beware of it.

675
00:47:50,249 --> 00:47:53,587
在你长途跋涉之后，很抱歉只给你一个录音欢迎
After your long journey, I'm sorry to give you only a recorded welcome.

676
00:47:54,418 --> 00:47:56,723
但我们守卫前哨站的人
But we who have guarded the outpost for you

677
00:47:56,830 --> 00:47:59,202
已经死了，到你占领星球时
will be dead by the time you take positions on this planet.

678
00:48:00,953 --> 00:48:03,658
我是我们先进部队中最后一个还活着的人
I am the last of our advanced force left alive.

679
00:48:04,829 --> 00:48:08,458
医生发现我们生病的原因时已经太晚了
Too late, the physicians discovered the cause of our sickness.

680
00:48:09,282 --> 00:48:11,082
在创造这个星球的过程中
In creating this planet,

681
00:48:11,343 --> 00:48:14,090
我们意外地产生了一种致命的生物
we have accidentally produced a deadly organism.

682
00:48:15,404 --> 00:48:19,460
我一直在等待来自家乡的补给船寻求医疗援助
I have awaited the regular supply ship from home for medical assistance,

683
00:48:20,194 --> 00:48:22,709
但我现在怀疑它是否会及时到达
but I doubt now whether it will arrive in time.

684
00:48:24,172 --> 00:48:26,519
我会将前哨站控制设置为自动
I will set the outpost controls on automatic.

685
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:32,250
计算机将抵御除我们自己以外的所有生命形式
The computer will defend against all life-forms but our own.

686
00:48:34,599 --> 00:48:37,684
我的卡兰丹同伴
My fellow Kalandans,

687
00:48:37,686 --> 00:48:40,955
我，洛西拉，祝你一切顺利
I, Losira, wish you well.

688
00:48:43,434 --> 00:48:47,254
先前的船只可能通过他们的人民传播这种疾病
The previous ships probably spread the disease all through their people.

689
00:48:47,741 --> 00:48:50,211
她等的补给船一直没有来
The supply ship she waited for never came.

690
00:48:50,541 --> 00:48:56,446
几千年来，她一直在等待迎接死去的人
All these thousands of years she's been waiting to greet people who were dead.

691
00:48:56,920 --> 00:48:59,207
为了防卫工作
To do the job of defense,

692
00:48:59,631 --> 00:49:02,734
计算机投影了唯一可用图像的复制品
the computer projected a replica of the only image available 

693
00:49:03,271 --> 00:49:04,364
洛西拉的
Losira's.

694
00:49:05,191 --> 00:49:06,562
电脑太完美了
The computer was too perfect.

695
00:49:07,583 --> 00:49:10,836
它把洛西拉的个性投射到复制品中
It projected so much of Losira's personality into the replica

696
00:49:11,264 --> 00:49:15,422
它对杀戮感到后悔，内疚
that it felt regret, guilt, at killing.

697
00:49:15,746 --> 00:49:18,478
这为我们赢得了摧毁它所需的时间
That bought us the time we needed to destroy it.

698
00:49:20,032 --> 00:49:23,878
她一定是…一个了不起的女人
She must have been... a remarkable woman.

699
00:49:23,982 --> 00:49:26,318
而且很漂亮
And beautiful.

700
00:49:26,484 --> 00:49:28,115
美丽是短暂的，医生
Beauty is transitory, Doctor.

701
00:49:29,694 --> 00:49:33,171
然而，她显然是非常聪明的
However, she was, evidently, highly intelligent.

702
00:49:33,780 --> 00:49:35,280
柯克呼叫企业号，传送五个人上船
Kirk to Enterprise. Five to beam up.

703
00:49:35,459 --> 00:49:36,537
我不同意你的看法，史波克先生
I don't agree with you, Mr. Spock.

704
00:49:36,537 --> 00:49:37,497
真的吗，舰长？
Indeed, captain?

705
00:49:37,882 --> 00:49:42,679
美…会留存下来
Beauty... survives.
