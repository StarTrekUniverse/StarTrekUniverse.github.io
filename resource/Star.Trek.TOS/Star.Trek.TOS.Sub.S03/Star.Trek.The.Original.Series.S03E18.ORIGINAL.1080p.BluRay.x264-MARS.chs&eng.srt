2
00:00:08,602 --> 00:00:11,146
企业号正在前往阿尔法记忆
The Enterprise is en route to Memory Alpha,

3
00:00:11,647 --> 00:00:16,109
一颗由联邦建立的小行星，专门作为中央图书馆
It is a planetoid set up by the Federation solely as a central library

4
00:00:16,204 --> 00:00:18,402
包含联邦成员的
containing the total cultural history

5
00:00:18,402 --> 00:00:22,470
所有文化历史和科学知识
and scientific knowledge of all Federation members.

6
00:00:22,901 --> 00:00:25,515
与我们同行的是专家米拉·罗曼上尉
With us is specialist Lieutenant Mira Romaine.

7
00:00:25,756 --> 00:00:29,626
她在船上监督新设计的设备的转移
She is on board to supervise the transfer of newly designed equipment...

8
00:00:29,626 --> 00:00:32,554
直接从企业号到阿尔法记忆
directly from the Enterprise to Memory Alpha.

9
00:00:33,176 --> 00:00:36,104
你是这艘船上
You're the sanest, the smartest,

10
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:39,432
最理智、最聪明、最漂亮的女人
the nicest woman that has ever come aboard this ship.

11
00:00:40,369 --> 00:00:41,855
还有吗？
Anything else?

12
00:00:43,589 --> 00:00:47,234
其他的我会…我会暂时保密
Anything else I'll... I'll keep to myself for the moment.

13
00:00:48,205 --> 00:00:50,432
[柯克] 当斯科提这个年纪的男人坠入爱河时
[Kirk] When a man of Scotty's years falls in love,

14
00:00:51,687 --> 00:00:54,222
他生命的孤独突然向他显露出来
the loneliness of his life is suddenly revealed to him.

15
00:00:55,011 --> 00:00:58,070
他的整个心脏一度只为这艘飞船的引擎而跳动
His whole heart once throbbed only to the ship's engines.

16
00:00:58,896 --> 00:01:00,496
他本来只能和飞船说话
He could talk only to the ship.

17
00:01:01,795 --> 00:01:03,767
现在他眼里只有那个女人
Now he can see nothing but the woman.

18
00:01:04,329 --> 00:01:07,463
我不认为斯科特先生会选择聪明的类型
I didn't think Mr. Scott would go for the brainy type.

19
00:01:08,214 --> 00:01:10,374
我认为他没有注意到她有头脑
I don't think he's even noticed she has a brain.

20
00:01:13,844 --> 00:01:15,046
斯科特先生
Mr. Scott.

21
00:01:17,036 --> 00:01:18,123
斯科特先生？
Mr. Scott?

22
00:01:18,725 --> 00:01:19,504
嗯？
Hmm?

23
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:23,111
一旦我们进入阿尔法记忆的可视范围内
As soon as we're within viewing range of Memory Alpha,

24
00:01:23,111 --> 00:01:26,485
你和罗曼上尉将前往紧急手动监视器
you and Lieutenant Romaine will go to the emergency manual monitor.

25
00:01:26,587 --> 00:01:29,319
你要准备直接转移设备到阿尔法记忆
You will prepare for direct transfer of equipment to Memory Alpha.

26
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:30,933
是的，舰长
Aye, Captain.

27
00:01:30,976 --> 00:01:31,851
我们准备好了，长官
We're ready, sir.

28
00:01:32,137 --> 00:01:37,804
上尉，请允许我为你即将到来的首次联邦任务表达祝贺
Lieutenant, may I offer my congratulations on what will be your first assignment for the Federation?

29
00:01:37,897 --> 00:01:39,068
是的，祝你好运，上尉
Yes. Good luck, Lieutenant.

30
00:01:39,301 --> 00:01:40,092
谢谢
Thank you.

31
00:01:46,334 --> 00:01:48,459
舰长，我接收到一个高强度读数
Captain, I'm picking up a high-intensity reading.

32
00:01:49,014 --> 00:01:50,263
是阿尔法记忆吗？
Is that Memory Alpha?

33
00:01:51,387 --> 00:01:51,975
不，长官
No, sir.

34
00:01:58,431 --> 00:01:59,528
抱歉
Excuse me.

35
00:02:03,196 --> 00:02:04,401
放大倍数8
Magnification 8.

36
00:02:10,542 --> 00:02:11,492
那是什么？
What is that?

37
00:02:11,674 --> 00:02:13,332
一场风暴的迹象，舰长
Indications are a storm, Captain,

38
00:02:13,719 --> 00:02:16,443
虽然我从未见过如此强烈
although I've never seen one of such great intensity

39
00:02:16,443 --> 00:02:17,903
或奇怪的构造
or strange conformation.

40
00:02:19,055 --> 00:02:19,919
读数？
Readings?

41
00:02:20,145 --> 00:02:22,914
所有传感器读数都处于最大刻度
All sensor readings are at maximum calibration.

42
00:02:23,432 --> 00:02:27,463
舰长，它正以曲速2.6靠近并且还在加速
Captain, it's approaching at warp factor 2.6 and accelerating.

43
00:02:27,631 --> 00:02:28,674
检查一下
Check that.

44
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:31,457
没有任何自然现象的运动速度可以超过光速
No natural phenomenon can move faster than the speed of light.

45
00:02:32,764 --> 00:02:34,507
它绝对超过光速，舰长
It is definitely doing so, Captain,

46
00:02:34,692 --> 00:02:37,394
所以它不可能是一种自然现象
therefore it cannot be a phenomenon of nature.

47
00:02:51,185 --> 00:02:52,499
开启护盾，黄色警报
Deflectors on. Condition Yellow.

48
00:02:52,499 --> 00:02:53,583
黄色警报，长官
Condition Yellow, sir.

49
00:02:53,583 --> 00:02:54,696
护盾已启动，舰长
Shields activated, Captain.

50
00:03:33,237 --> 00:03:36,070
[柯克] 宇宙，最后的边疆
[Kirk] Space, the final frontier.

51
00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:45,980
这些是星舰企业号的航程
These are the voyages of the starship Enterprise.

52
00:03:46,571 --> 00:03:50,209
它的五年任务：探索未知的新世界
Its five-year mission: To explore strange new worlds,

53
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:53,746
寻找新生命和新文明
to seek out new life and new civilizations,

54
00:03:54,663 --> 00:03:57,543
勇踏前人未至之境
to boldly go where no man has gone before.

55
00:03:58,459 --> 00:04:01,636
星际旅行：原初
第三季第十八集

56
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:34,390
泽塔之光
The Lights of Zetar

57
00:04:58,649 --> 00:05:00,313
苏鲁先生，带我们离开这鬼地方！
Mr. Sulu, get us the devil out of here!

58
00:05:01,097 --> 00:05:03,401
全面扫描舰桥受到的干扰
Full scan on the disturbance that penetrated the bridge!

59
00:05:04,114 --> 00:05:06,171
上尉，所有甲板，损坏报告
Lieutenant, all decks, damage report.

60
00:05:08,035 --> 00:05:09,254
米拉！
Mira!

61
00:05:11,232 --> 00:05:13,450
[柯克] 麦考伊医生来舰桥，紧急情况，紧急情况
[Kirk] Dr. McCoy to the bridge. Emergency. Emergency.

62
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:14,502
米拉！米拉！
Mira! Mira!

63
00:05:19,734 --> 00:05:21,861
[外星人沙哑的说话声]
[Alien Croaking]

64
00:05:22,042 --> 00:05:23,625
你在说什么？
What's that you're saying?

65
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:40,490
她受伤是因为摔倒还是骚乱？
Was she hurt by the fall or the action of the disturbance?

66
00:05:41,685 --> 00:05:43,356
我不知道，你注意到了吗，斯科提？
I don't know. Did you notice, Scotty?

67
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:46,868
嗯，骚乱结束后，她就倒下了
Well, after the disturbance was over, she just collapsed.

68
00:05:55,135 --> 00:05:56,415
医生，她怎么样？
How's she doing, Doctor?

69
00:05:57,333 --> 00:05:59,125
我想她现在要醒了
Well, I think she's coming around now.

70
00:05:59,518 --> 00:06:03,550
小心，慢点，你摔得不轻
Easy now. Easy. You had quite a fall.

71
00:06:05,141 --> 00:06:06,878
我…我很好
I'm... I'm fine.

72
00:06:09,706 --> 00:06:12,417
好不好我说了算，你想走到医务室吗？
You let me be the judge of that. Do you feel like walking to sickbay?

73
00:06:12,481 --> 00:06:14,038
我很好，医生，真的，我很好
I'm fine, Doctor. Really, I am.

74
00:06:15,717 --> 00:06:16,761
其他人好吗？
Is everybody else all right?

75
00:06:16,761 --> 00:06:17,780
是的，很好
Aye, they are.

76
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:19,483
你只要按照麦考伊医生的命令做
You just do what Dr. McCoy ordered.

77
00:06:19,725 --> 00:06:20,821
为什么？我觉得…
Why? I feel...

78
00:06:20,821 --> 00:06:22,979
去医务室，上尉，那是命令
Get to sick bay, Lieutenant. That's an order.

79
00:06:23,292 --> 00:06:24,128
是的，长官
Yes, sir.

80
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:26,340
舰长，我也去医务室可以吗？
Captain, would it be all right if I went to Sickbay?

81
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:28,045
不，暂时留在你的岗位上
No. Stay at your post for the moment.

82
00:06:28,084 --> 00:06:28,645
舰长
Captain.

83
00:06:28,694 --> 00:06:29,654
乌乎拉上尉
Lieutenant Uhura,

84
00:06:29,654 --> 00:06:30,023
是的，长官
Yes, sir.

85
00:06:30,023 --> 00:06:30,578
损坏报告？
damage report?

86
00:06:30,924 --> 00:06:32,195
所有电台都可使用，长官
All stations are operative, sir.

87
00:06:33,027 --> 00:06:33,687
史波克先生？
Mr. Spock?

88
00:06:33,791 --> 00:06:36,034
部分设备暂时出现故障
Some equipment was temporarily out of order.

89
00:06:36,034 --> 00:06:37,805
我的传感器不起作用
My sensors were inoperative.

90
00:06:37,999 --> 00:06:39,283
曲速引擎有任何损坏吗？
Any damage to the warp engines?

91
00:06:39,744 --> 00:06:40,489
没有，舰长
None, Captain.

92
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:43,868
好的，从那场…风暴的行动来看
Good. From the action of that ... storm,

93
00:06:44,368 --> 00:06:45,914
我们需要所有能获得的速度
we'll need all the speed we can get.

94
00:06:46,306 --> 00:06:48,767
舰长，那不是风暴
Captain, it was not a storm.

95
00:06:49,818 --> 00:06:55,770
舰长，在干扰中，阿尔法记忆在呼叫
Captain, during the disturbance, Memory Alpha was hailing.

96
00:06:56,455 --> 00:06:59,649
我想回应，但我的手无法移动
I wanted to respond, but I couldn't make my hand move.

97
00:06:59,815 --> 00:07:00,551
[契科夫] 舰长
[Cehkov] Captain.

98
00:07:02,855 --> 00:07:05,415
瘫痪的不是手，是眼睛
It was not hands that were paralyzed. It was eyes.

99
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:08,465
我不能让眼睛向下看设置新的航线
I could not force my eyes to look down and set a new course.

100
00:07:08,465 --> 00:07:10,307
[苏鲁] 不，是言语能力受到了影响
[Sulu] No, no, it was speech that was affected.

101
00:07:10,359 --> 00:07:11,601
我发不出声音
I couldn't utter a sound.

102
00:07:17,057 --> 00:07:19,627
史波克先生，解释一下？
Mr. Spock. Explanation?

103
00:07:20,384 --> 00:07:22,379
只看结果，不看原因
Only of the result, not of the cause.

104
00:07:22,588 --> 00:07:25,746
在每种情况下，大脑的不同区域受到影响
In each case, a different area of the brain was affected.

105
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:29,333
我们的自主神经功能处于某种形式的压力
Our voluntary nerve functions were under some form of pressure.

106
00:07:31,356 --> 00:07:32,565
或者攻击之下
Or attack.

107
00:07:32,853 --> 00:07:36,053
攻击也许是更精确的表述，舰长
Attack might be a more precise formulation, Captain.

108
00:07:40,973 --> 00:07:44,685
罗曼上尉似乎最容易受到影响
And Lieutenant Romaine seems most susceptible.

109
00:08:00,259 --> 00:08:01,868
读数一致吗，护士？
Are the readings corresponding, Nurse?

110
00:08:02,102 --> 00:08:03,709
一切看起来都很正常，医生
Everything appears normal, Doctor.

111
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:04,864
谢谢
Thank you.

112
00:08:14,993 --> 00:08:16,361
你在做什么，护士？
What's that you're doing, Nurse?

113
00:08:16,646 --> 00:08:18,978
在电脑里记下你的反应
Recording your responses in this computer.

114
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:21,522
为什么？我没有值得注意的反应
Why? I haven't had a single response worth noting.

115
00:08:21,689 --> 00:08:22,690
上尉，拜托
Lieutenant, please.

116
00:08:22,768 --> 00:08:23,778
那，我有吗？
Well, have I?

117
00:08:25,472 --> 00:08:28,183
上尉，这艘飞船上有430人
Lieutenant, there are 430 people aboard this ship.

118
00:08:28,962 --> 00:08:31,778
你是唯一一个昏倒的人，我想知道为什么
You're the only one that passed out and I want to know why.

119
00:08:32,033 --> 00:08:33,338
我也想知道为什么
I want to know why, too.

120
00:08:34,071 --> 00:08:35,550
你是医生，你告诉我
You're the doctor. You tell me.

121
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:37,482
这对我来说是一种全新的体验
This whole thing is a new experience for me.

122
00:08:37,573 --> 00:08:39,498
这对我们所有人来说都是一种全新的体验
This whole thing is a new experience for all of us.

123
00:08:39,953 --> 00:08:42,171
你们都习惯了新的体验
All of you are accustomed to new experiences.

124
00:08:42,171 --> 00:08:43,364
这是你们工作的一部分
It's part of your work.

125
00:08:44,946 --> 00:08:46,003
我没有
I'm not.

126
00:08:46,797 --> 00:08:48,707
她可能有些问题，麦考伊医生
She might have something there, Dr. McCoy.

127
00:08:48,999 --> 00:08:50,821
这是她的首次深空旅行
This is her first deep space trip.

128
00:08:50,821 --> 00:08:52,222
你知道它对人们有什么影响
You know how that affects people.

129
00:08:52,404 --> 00:08:55,963
如果我们继续，斯科提，可能会得出这样的判定
If we can get on with this, Scotty, we might make that determination.

130
00:08:59,252 --> 00:09:00,270
那么，现在告诉我
Now, then, tell me.

131
00:09:00,432 --> 00:09:02,324
你昏倒前有什么感觉？
What did you feel before you passed out?

132
00:09:03,357 --> 00:09:04,193
没有
Nothing.

133
00:09:04,602 --> 00:09:05,341
没有？
Nothing?

134
00:09:07,397 --> 00:09:09,193
绝对没有
Absolutely nothing.

135
00:09:09,433 --> 00:09:10,179
上尉…
Lieutenant...

136
00:09:10,302 --> 00:09:12,611
医生，我没有什么可以告诉你的了!
Doctor, there is nothing more I can tell you!

137
00:09:12,941 --> 00:09:14,913
上尉，你完全不合作！
Lieutenant, you're being completely uncooperative.

138
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:17,453
你会把它放在我的记录里吗？
Are you putting that into my record? It's not true.

139
00:09:17,746 --> 00:09:20,306
我会把真相放在你的记录里，要是我能知道的话
I'll put the facts into your record if I can get them.

140
00:09:22,934 --> 00:09:24,374
好了，米拉
Come on, now, Mira.

141
00:09:24,374 --> 00:09:26,229
我们必须帮助医生
We must help the doctor.

142
00:09:26,955 --> 00:09:27,981
告诉我们发生了什么
Tell us what happened.

143
00:09:32,013 --> 00:09:33,913
也许你可以向她解释一下
Perhaps you can explain to her

144
00:09:33,913 --> 00:09:36,241
她希望在星际舰队中从事的任何职业
that any career she hopes for in Starfleet

145
00:09:36,241 --> 00:09:39,322
都需要纪律和合作
requires discipline and cooperation.

146
00:09:40,184 --> 00:09:42,434
嗯，我相信这就是上尉想要的
Well, I'm sure that's what the lieutenant wants.

147
00:09:42,564 --> 00:09:44,153
她只是不理解
She just didn't understand.

148
00:09:45,301 --> 00:09:46,390
是吧，姑娘？
Did you, now, lass?

149
00:09:50,456 --> 00:09:52,589
对待病人的态度真不错，斯科提
With a bedside manner like that, Scotty,

150
00:09:52,868 --> 00:09:54,425
你入错行了
you're in the wrong business.

151
00:09:59,859 --> 00:10:02,466
记录被发送后，我会被遣返，不是吗？
When the record of this is forwarded, I'll be sent back, won't I?

152
00:10:02,654 --> 00:10:05,403
才不会，太荒唐了
You will not. That's ridiculous.

153
00:10:06,182 --> 00:10:09,119
习惯太空旅行需要一个过程
This getting used to space travel, that takes some doing.

154
00:10:09,301 --> 00:10:10,589
不是每个人都能接受它
Not everybody takes to it.

155
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:11,856
那你呢？
Did you?

156
00:10:12,809 --> 00:10:14,677
呃，我，那是不同的
Well, me, that's different.

157
00:10:14,677 --> 00:10:16,418
我几乎是为它而生的
I was practically born to it.

158
00:10:18,192 --> 00:10:19,268
我想继续
I want to continue.

159
00:10:19,696 --> 00:10:20,578
你会的
You will.

160
00:10:21,265 --> 00:10:24,611
你通过了星际舰队的初步考试
You passed your Starfleet preliminary examinations.

161
00:10:26,862 --> 00:10:31,771
这只是习惯了你所谓的太空腿
And this is just getting used to what you might call your space legs.

162
00:10:36,784 --> 00:10:38,216
我希望这就是全部
I hope that's all it is.

163
00:10:39,209 --> 00:10:41,355
舰长，我已经绘制了风暴的路径
Captain, I've plotted the storm's path.

164
00:10:42,172 --> 00:10:42,820
莱姆利先生
Mr. Lemli.

165
00:10:46,232 --> 00:10:47,270
主屏幕投影
Main screen projection.

166
00:10:50,026 --> 00:10:53,905
在目前的过程中，它将像击中我们一样击中阿尔法记忆小行星
On its present course, it will hit the Memory Alpha planetoid as it did us.

167
00:10:54,543 --> 00:10:58,255
上尉，尝试警告阿尔法记忆那个现象的接近
Lieutenant, try and warn Memory Alpha of the proximity of that phenomenon.

168
00:10:58,471 --> 00:11:00,427
给我一个ETA的影响
Give me an ETA for its possible impact.

169
00:11:00,654 --> 00:11:01,296
我不能，长官
I cannot, sir.

170
00:11:01,296 --> 00:11:03,105
它具有改变速度的能力
It has the ability to change speed.

171
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:06,977
长官，无法建立与小行星的联系
Sir, I'm unable to establish contact with the planetoid.

172
00:11:07,314 --> 00:11:09,565
我在所有频率上呼叫，没有反应
I'm hailing on all frequencies. No response.

173
00:11:10,193 --> 00:11:11,750
影响不大，舰长
It is of little consequence, captain.

174
00:11:11,841 --> 00:11:13,891
阿尔法记忆没有护盾
Memory Alpha has no protective shields.

175
00:11:14,843 --> 00:11:15,615
没有护盾？
No shields?

176
00:11:15,926 --> 00:11:16,637
没有，舰长
None, Captain.

177
00:11:16,853 --> 00:11:18,771
图书馆综合体组装时
When the library complex was assembled,

178
00:11:18,948 --> 00:11:22,398
屏蔽行为被认为与其纯粹的学术目的相悖
shielding was considered inappropriate to its totally academic purpose.

179
00:11:22,735 --> 00:11:26,243
由于记忆星球上的信息对每个人都是免费提供的
Since the information on the Memory planet is freely available to everyone,

180
00:11:26,581 --> 00:11:28,759
特殊保护被认为是不必要的
special protection was deemed unnecessary.

181
00:11:29,352 --> 00:11:30,050
好极了
Wonderful.

182
00:11:30,679 --> 00:11:33,195
我希望风暴知道这个理由
I hope the storm is aware of that rationale.

183
00:11:33,416 --> 00:11:35,484
正在靠近小行星
Completing approach to planetoid.

184
00:11:35,549 --> 00:11:37,085
它已经超过了阿尔法记忆，舰长
It is already over Memory Alpha, Captain!

185
00:11:37,495 --> 00:11:39,200
它的速度令人难以置信
Its speed is incredible.

186
00:11:39,855 --> 00:11:41,079
它正在撞击小行星
It's hitting the planetoid.

187
00:11:44,161 --> 00:11:45,860
我们在轨道范围内吗？
Are we within orbit range, Mr. Chekov?

188
00:11:45,977 --> 00:11:46,975
正在降落
Making final approach.

189
00:11:47,396 --> 00:11:48,869
上尉，试着警告他们…
Lieutenant, try and warn them ...

190
00:11:48,869 --> 00:11:51,230
抱歉，长官，我无法突破干扰
I'm sorry, sir. I can't break through this interference.

191
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:03,362
史波克先生，有多少人在阿尔法记忆上？
Mr. Spock, how many people are on Memory Alpha?

192
00:12:03,648 --> 00:12:06,534
它因使用该复合体的各个联邦行星的
It varies with the number of scholars, researchers, and scientists

193
00:12:06,534 --> 00:12:09,465
学者，研究人员和科学家的数量而异
from various Federation planets who are using the complex.

194
00:12:10,022 --> 00:12:13,011
[契科夫] 舰长，我们在轨道范围内
[Chekov] Captain, we are within orbit range.

195
00:12:18,161 --> 00:12:18,861
锁定轨道
Lock into orbit.

196
00:12:19,114 --> 00:12:19,714
是的，长官
Aye, sir.

197
00:12:20,294 --> 00:12:21,884
[苏鲁] 它正在离开阿尔法记忆，舰长
[Sulu] It is leaving Memory Alpha, Captain.

198
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:25,558
传感器没有检测到阿尔法记忆有能量产生
Sensors give no readings of generated energy from Memory Alpha.

199
00:12:26,332 --> 00:12:27,052
有生命读数吗？
Any life readings?

200
00:12:27,979 --> 00:12:28,627
没有
None.

201
00:12:34,704 --> 00:12:36,377
让我们看看下面发生了什么
Let's find out what's going on down there.

202
00:12:40,462 --> 00:12:41,934
柯克呼叫轮机部，斯科特先生，报告
Kirk to engineering. Mr. Scott, report.

203
00:12:43,517 --> 00:12:45,040
柯克呼叫轮机部，斯科特先生？
Kirk to engineering. Mr. Scott?

204
00:12:45,436 --> 00:12:46,412
该死他到底在哪儿？
Where the devil is he?

205
00:12:46,999 --> 00:12:48,283
斯科提，到舰桥报告
Scotty, report to the bridge,

206
00:12:48,283 --> 00:12:49,586
到舰桥报告
report to the bridge.

207
00:12:51,344 --> 00:12:53,868
传送室，待命，我会带一支登陆小队过来
Transporter room, stand by. I'm taking a landing party down there.

208
00:12:53,951 --> 00:12:54,551
是的，长官
Aye, aye, sir.

209
00:12:54,807 --> 00:12:55,546
我是斯科特
Scott here.

210
00:12:56,983 --> 00:12:59,048
斯科提，你去哪儿了？现在在哪里？
Scotty, where've you been? Where are you?

211
00:12:59,229 --> 00:13:00,150
在医务室
In the Sickbay.

212
00:13:00,617 --> 00:13:01,214
你生病了吗？
Are you sick?

213
00:13:01,622 --> 00:13:05,701
哦不，我只是在查看那个女孩
Oh no. I was just checking on the lass.

214
00:13:05,883 --> 00:13:08,282
她会没事的，她没毛病
She's going to be fine. There's nothing wrong with that.

215
00:13:08,561 --> 00:13:11,116
好的，听到你的预测，我松了口气，斯科特先生
Well, I'm relieved to hear your prognosis, Mr. Scott.

216
00:13:11,116 --> 00:13:13,677
医生和你在一起还是我该去轮机部找他？
Is the doctor there with you or will I find him in engineering?

217
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:18,068
我是麦考伊，吉姆
McCoy here, Jim.

218
00:13:18,755 --> 00:13:19,734
医生，女孩怎么样？
Doctor, how's the girl?

219
00:13:19,961 --> 00:13:21,252
我认为她的状态很好
I think she's in good shape.

220
00:13:21,569 --> 00:13:23,488
嗯，斯科特先生似乎同意你的看法
Well, Mr. Scott seems to agree with you.

221
00:13:24,864 --> 00:13:26,712
你们两个立刻到传送室见我
The two of you meet me in the transporter room on the double.

222
00:13:47,302 --> 00:13:51,974
[柯克] 舰长日志，补充，星历，5725.6
[Kirk] Captain's log, supplemental, stardate, 5725.6.

223
00:13:53,436 --> 00:13:55,524
风暴已经清除了阿尔法记忆
The storm has cleared Memory Alpha.

224
00:13:55,524 --> 00:13:57,636
它正以令人难以置信的速度远去
It is heading away at incredible speed.

225
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:01,132
我们一直无法与小行星取得联系
We have been unable to make contact with the planetoid.

226
00:14:01,762 --> 00:14:04,116
它的沉默是不祥的
Its silence is ominous.

227
00:14:05,102 --> 00:14:07,061
我们正传送下去调查
We are beaming down to investigate.

228
00:14:09,544 --> 00:14:12,566
不知怎的，我觉得传送到黑暗中令人不安
Somehow I find transporting into darkness unnerving.

229
00:14:12,744 --> 00:14:14,092
斯科提，你能不能给我们弄亮些？
Scotty, can you get us some more light?

230
00:14:23,143 --> 00:14:25,380
恐怕这灯只能这样了，舰长
I'm afraid this light will have to do, Captain.

231
00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:27,449
发电机不工作
The generator is inoperative.

232
00:14:27,844 --> 00:14:28,901
损坏报告，史波克
Damage report.

233
00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:30,866
银河系的灾难，舰长
Disaster for the galaxy, Captain.

234
00:14:31,255 --> 00:14:33,836
中枢大脑受损，记忆核心烧毁
The central brain is damaged. The memory core is burned out.

235
00:14:33,836 --> 00:14:36,332
银河系的损失可能无法挽回
The loss to the galaxy may be irretrievable.

236
00:14:37,987 --> 00:14:38,778
舰长！
Captain!

237
00:15:04,996 --> 00:15:07,849
附近有一个非常微弱的生命读数，舰长
Getting a very faint life reading in the immediate vicinity, Captain.

238
00:15:08,037 --> 00:15:09,308
找到他，让他活着
Locate him and keep him alive.

239
00:15:09,438 --> 00:15:11,636
我们需要更多有关这个敌人的信息
We need more information about this enemy.

240
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:15,728
这边，舰长！
Over here, Captain!

241
00:15:21,714 --> 00:15:24,894
[咆哮]
[GROWLS]

242
00:15:27,291 --> 00:15:28,354
老骨头，你能做点什么吗？
Bones, can you do something?

243
00:15:29,548 --> 00:15:30,718
没有，吉姆
Not a thing, Jim.

244
00:15:37,608 --> 00:15:41,378
罗曼上尉昏倒时发出了一样含混不清的声音
The same garbled sounds Lieutenant Romaine made when she fainted.

245
00:15:42,186 --> 00:15:42,971
你确定吗？
Are you sure?

246
00:15:43,172 --> 00:15:44,262
我确定
Absolutely sure.

247
00:15:46,706 --> 00:15:47,517
柯克呼叫企业号
Kirk to Enterprise.

248
00:15:47,731 --> 00:15:48,331
我是苏鲁
Sulu here.

249
00:15:48,464 --> 00:15:50,143
立即把罗曼上尉传送下来
Beam down Lieutenant Romaine immediately.

250
00:16:01,174 --> 00:16:05,169
史波克，你以前见过这样的东西吗？
Spock, have you ever seen anything like that before?

251
00:16:05,824 --> 00:16:06,520
没有
Negative.

252
00:16:14,805 --> 00:16:15,758
老骨头？
Bones?

253
00:16:16,815 --> 00:16:17,620
她死了
She's dead.

254
00:16:18,158 --> 00:16:19,143
她死于什么？
What did she die of?

255
00:16:19,831 --> 00:16:21,517
严重的脑出血…
Severe brain hemorrhaging ...

256
00:16:21,569 --> 00:16:23,462
由于神经系统扭曲
due to distortion of all neural systems,

257
00:16:24,078 --> 00:16:26,601
自主神经系统溶解
dissolution of autonomic nervous system.

258
00:16:26,951 --> 00:16:29,000
所有基本的人格因素，舰长
All basic personality factors, Captin.

259
00:16:29,798 --> 00:16:31,354
攻击是彻底的
The attack was thorough.

260
00:16:32,852 --> 00:16:34,240
其他人是怎么死的？
What did the others die of?

261
00:16:34,564 --> 00:16:37,729
每个都有不同的大脑中枢被摧毁，原因不明
Each had a different center of brain destroyed, cause unknown.

262
00:16:38,099 --> 00:16:40,965
你说，一个不同的大脑中枢
A different center of the brain, you say.

263
00:16:41,442 --> 00:16:42,152
是的，舰长
Yes, Captain.

264
00:16:42,469 --> 00:16:44,823
等我们回到船上，我可以用船上的电脑
I can be more detailed when we return to the ship

265
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:46,250
更详细地解释
and use the ship's computers.

266
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:52,878
米拉！
Mira!

267
00:16:54,907 --> 00:16:56,596
舰长有几个问题
The captain has some questions.

268
00:16:59,161 --> 00:16:59,842
是的，长官
Yes, Captain.

269
00:16:59,894 --> 00:17:03,474
上尉，当你昏迷时，你在说话
Lieutenant, when you were unconscious, you were speaking.

270
00:17:04,173 --> 00:17:05,043
我说了什么？
What did I say?

271
00:17:05,335 --> 00:17:07,656
我不知道，我不熟悉这些话
I don't know. The words were unfamiliar to me.

272
00:17:07,843 --> 00:17:08,999
听起来像什么？
What did it sound like?

273
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:12,358
听起来和技术员的遗言一模一样
They sounded exactly like the last words spoken by the technician.

274
00:17:12,617 --> 00:17:13,590
什么技术员？
What technician?

275
00:17:13,979 --> 00:17:16,580
我们在那儿发现一个奄奄一息的人
We found one person in there barely alive.

276
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:18,000
其他人都死了，我们…
The rest were dead and we...

277
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:19,666
上尉
Lieutenant.

278
00:17:28,784 --> 00:17:29,335
上尉？
Lieutenant?

279
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:31,600
我们必须回到船上
We must get back to the ship.

280
00:17:32,383 --> 00:17:34,854
为什么？告诉我为什么？
Why? Tell me, why?

281
00:17:35,022 --> 00:17:36,734
那个风暴，它回来了
That storm, it's returning.

282
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:37,999
你怎么知道？
How do you know?

283
00:17:38,401 --> 00:17:41,371
我知道，如果我们留下来，你会被杀的
I know. You'll be killed if we stay.

284
00:17:41,559 --> 00:17:46,541
上尉，我向你保证，那个无法解释的现象正在远离这个星球
Lieutenant, I assure you, that unexplained phenomenon was headed away from the planet.

285
00:17:46,708 --> 00:17:48,589
它可能正在寻找其他受害者
It is probably seeking other victims.

286
00:17:48,589 --> 00:17:50,305
我和你说它会杀了我们
I tell you it will kill us.

287
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:58,173
企业号呼叫柯克舰长
Enterprise to Captain Kirk.

288
00:17:58,527 --> 00:17:59,266
我是柯克
Kirk here.

289
00:17:59,581 --> 00:18:00,398
舰桥，长官
Bridge, sir.

290
00:18:00,462 --> 00:18:03,843
风暴再次出现在长距离扫描仪上并且正在快速接近
The storm has reappeared on the long-range scanner and is closing fast.

291
00:18:07,693 --> 00:18:08,633
它的航线？
What's its course?

292
00:18:09,269 --> 00:18:10,637
回到这个方向
Coming back in this direction.

293
00:18:13,627 --> 00:18:14,580
把我们传送上去
Beam us up.

294
00:18:26,168 --> 00:18:28,536
苏鲁先生，我是舰长，让企业号离开这里
Mr. Sulu, this is the captain. Get the Enterprise out of here.

295
00:18:28,827 --> 00:18:30,299
等等，舰长，我们把米拉弄丢了
Wait, Captain, we've lost Mira.

296
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:34,417
推迟命令，苏鲁先生
Delay that order, Mr. Sulu!

297
00:18:34,417 --> 00:18:35,052
让她稳定下来
Stabilize her!

298
00:18:35,218 --> 00:18:39,097
有东西正在干扰传送信号，她停留在传送中
Something's interfering with the transporter signal. She's suspended in transit.

299
00:18:39,339 --> 00:18:40,341
让我
Let me.

300
00:19:04,863 --> 00:19:06,911
好了，苏鲁先生，带我们离开这里
All right, Mr. Sulu, get us out of here.

301
00:19:07,872 --> 00:19:10,688
斯科特先生，检查传送装置控制器的紧急手动监视器
Mr. Scott, check emergency manual monitor for transporter control.

302
00:19:26,445 --> 00:19:28,163
舰长，它正在改变航线
Captain, it's changing course.

303
00:19:29,454 --> 00:19:30,990
绘制新航线，契科夫先生
Plot the new course, Mr. Chekov.

304
00:19:31,246 --> 00:19:33,468
当前航线是126，标记20
Present course is 126, mark 20.

305
00:19:33,578 --> 00:19:34,218
绘制它
Plot it.

306
00:19:34,856 --> 00:19:38,020
目前的课程将把它带到我们的右舷，长官
Present course will bring it across our starboard side, sir.

307
00:19:38,364 --> 00:19:42,501
史波克先生，你说过那个现象不是风暴
Mr. Spock, you made a statement that phenomenon is not a storm.

308
00:19:43,001 --> 00:19:43,716
解释
Explain.

309
00:19:44,369 --> 00:19:47,999
太空中没有已知的条件支持这种现象
No known conditions in space would support that phenomenon.

310
00:19:48,506 --> 00:19:49,082
它是什么？
What is it?

311
00:19:49,082 --> 00:19:51,379
船上的传感器有点问题
I'm having difficulty with the ship's sensors.

312
00:19:51,483 --> 00:19:54,258
他们似乎受到这种现象的选择性攻击
They seem to be under selective attack by the phenomenon

313
00:19:54,258 --> 00:19:56,969
就像阿尔法记忆上不幸的居住者一样
as the unfortunate occupants of Memory Alpha were.

314
00:19:57,157 --> 00:19:59,984
那就不能用演绎推理的方法了
Then deductive reasoning will have to be substituted.

315
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:02,719
飞船的传感器目前正在运行
Ship's sensors are operating at the moment.

316
00:20:03,181 --> 00:20:06,800
也许这个难以捉摸的生物现在会揭示一些关于它自己的东西
Perhaps the elusive creature will now reveal something about itself.

317
00:20:07,092 --> 00:20:11,171
但我看到那些人死了，就在他们的位置上
But I saw those men dead, in their exact positions.

318
00:20:11,579 --> 00:20:12,941
听我说
Listen to me.

319
00:20:13,641 --> 00:20:17,435
我告诉过你太空旅行会在你的大脑中玩什么奇怪的把戏
I've told you what strange tricks a space trip can play on your mind.

320
00:20:17,915 --> 00:20:19,387
现在就是这样
Now, that's all it is.

321
00:20:19,666 --> 00:20:20,370
不，斯科提
No, Scotty.

322
00:20:22,526 --> 00:20:25,333
在此之前，你有没有预见过未来的事情？
Have you ever had visions of the future events before this?

323
00:20:26,496 --> 00:20:27,156
从没有过
Never.

324
00:20:27,687 --> 00:20:29,672
如果你问我，没人有过
If you ask me, nobody ever has.

325
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:32,668
预见未来，纯粹是胡说八道
That seeing of the future, it's pure bunk.

326
00:20:33,089 --> 00:20:34,088
你知道的，不是吗？
You know that, don't you?

327
00:20:35,171 --> 00:20:36,241
我一直相信
I've always believed it.

328
00:20:36,429 --> 00:20:37,703
那你是完全正确的
And you were perfectly right.

329
00:20:40,514 --> 00:20:41,732
那么是什么，斯科提？
Then what is it, Scotty?

330
00:20:42,447 --> 00:20:43,608
是什么让我害怕？
What's frightening me?

331
00:20:43,608 --> 00:20:46,195
自从那场暴风雨袭击
Ever since that storm hit,

332
00:20:46,228 --> 00:20:50,395
我有了这种奇怪的想法，这种恐惧感
I've had such strange thoughts, such feelings of terror.

333
00:20:51,428 --> 00:20:57,012
太空，太空，这就是全部原因
Space. Space. That's all it is.

334
00:21:00,066 --> 00:21:01,346
那我就不用报了吧？
Then I don't have to report it?

335
00:21:01,979 --> 00:21:04,703
嗯，如果你想在医务室度过余下的旅行
Well, if you want to spend the rest of the trip in sick bay.

336
00:21:05,578 --> 00:21:06,707
但这有什么好处呢？
But what good would that do?

337
00:21:06,856 --> 00:21:09,787
麦考伊医生无法治愈它，就像他无法治愈感冒一样
Dr. McCoy can no more cure it than he can a cold.

338
00:21:18,392 --> 00:21:20,133
舰长，它直冲我们而来
Captain, it's heading straight for us.

339
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:21,635
激活盾牌
Activate shields.

340
00:21:22,147 --> 00:21:23,034
护盾激活
Shields activated.

341
00:21:23,639 --> 00:21:26,499
契科夫先生，改航向143，标记3
Mr. Chekov, change course to 143, mark 3.

342
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:28,749
143，标记3
143, mark 3.

343
00:21:29,222 --> 00:21:30,477
风暴的路线，苏鲁先生？
Storm's course, Mr. Sulu?

344
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:32,938
143，标记3
143, mark 3.

345
00:21:34,274 --> 00:21:35,435
采取规避动作
Take evasive action.

346
00:21:35,843 --> 00:21:36,706
规避动作
Evasive action.

347
00:21:37,704 --> 00:21:41,595
右满舵，217，标记5
Hard starboard, 217, mark 5.

348
00:21:41,861 --> 00:21:44,032
217，标记5
217, mark 5.

349
00:21:59,791 --> 00:22:00,589
还跟着我们，长官
Still with us, sir.

350
00:22:01,264 --> 00:22:05,991
左满舵，117，标记2
Hard port, 117, mark 2.

351
00:22:06,737 --> 00:22:08,529
117，标记2
117, mark 2.

352
00:22:12,404 --> 00:22:13,423
还跟着我们，长官
Still with us, sir.

353
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:17,527
还在接近吗？
Is it closing?

354
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:19,888
没有，舰长，保持距离
Negative, Captain. Maintaining its distance.

355
00:22:20,471 --> 00:22:23,487
然而，它跟随我们执行的每个飞行动作
However, it is matching each maneuver we execute

356
00:22:24,317 --> 00:22:27,897
我正在接收越来越大的能量
and I am receiving increasing magnitude of energy.

357
00:22:52,558 --> 00:22:54,951
你的分析，史波克？它是什么？
Your analysis, Spock? What is it?

358
00:22:55,243 --> 00:22:58,407
不是它是什么，舰长，而是他们是谁？
Not what is it, Captain. What are they?

359
00:23:01,151 --> 00:23:03,563
里面有十个不同的生命单位
There are ten distinct life units within it,

360
00:23:03,563 --> 00:23:05,489
都充满活力和活力
all powerfully alive and vital.

361
00:23:08,537 --> 00:23:09,931
他们是谁？他们从哪里来？
Who are they? Where are they from?

362
00:23:10,372 --> 00:23:13,654
如果不进行分析编程，就无法确定
Impossible to determine without programming for analysis.

363
00:23:13,796 --> 00:23:15,113
显然，我们快不过他们
It's clearly we can't outrun them. What about shields?

364
00:23:15,204 --> 00:23:16,222
我们能抵御他们吗？
Can we shield against them?

365
00:23:16,513 --> 00:23:19,853
我认为企业号的盾牌不会被证明是有效的防御
I do not believe Enterprise's shields would prove effective defence.

366
00:23:20,002 --> 00:23:21,980
一定有我们能用的防御
There must be some defense we can use.

367
00:23:22,168 --> 00:23:25,261
我们正在与一个由生命单位组成的团体打交道
We are dealing with a community of life units.

368
00:23:25,385 --> 00:23:28,458
它们的攻击以脑电波的形式
Their attack is in the form of brain waves

369
00:23:28,458 --> 00:23:30,889
针对大脑，它们是相容的
directed against the brain, which is most compatible.

370
00:23:31,467 --> 00:23:33,304
也许我们可以避免另一次攻击
Maybe we can avoid another attack.

371
00:23:33,368 --> 00:23:35,644
乌乎拉上尉，打开所有通道
Lieutenant Uhura, open all channels.

372
00:23:35,644 --> 00:23:37,080
接入通用翻译器
Tie in the universal translator.

373
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:40,040
史波克先生说它是活的
Mr. Spock says it's alive.

374
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:42,846
也许我可以和它谈谈
Maybe I can talk to it.

375
00:23:44,048 --> 00:23:46,544
所有频道都打开了，翻译器已接入
All channels open. Translator tied in.

376
00:23:51,895 --> 00:23:54,528
我是联邦星舰企业号的詹姆斯柯克舰长
This is Captain James Kirk of the USS Enterprise.

377
00:23:55,396 --> 00:23:56,693
我们希望你没有恶意
We wish you no harm.

378
00:24:10,798 --> 00:24:13,729
我们之间的身体接触对我这样的生命形式是致命的
Physical contact between us is fatal to our life-forms.

379
00:24:13,787 --> 00:24:17,173
请不要再靠近我们的飞船了
Please, do not come any closer to our ship.

380
00:24:22,289 --> 00:24:24,137
也许它不明白
Perhaps it did not understand.

381
00:24:24,403 --> 00:24:26,712
舰长，记录到速度变化
Captain, change in velocity recorded.

382
00:24:29,662 --> 00:24:32,534
[苏鲁] 他们掠过我们的右舷并在我们前面机动飞行
[Sulu] They are passing our star board side and maneuvering in front of us.

383
00:24:33,125 --> 00:24:34,341
切换到前向扫描仪
Switching to forward scanner.

384
00:24:46,234 --> 00:24:48,992
舰长，记录到速度变化
Captain, change in velocity recorded.

385
00:24:49,670 --> 00:24:51,420
它加速了它的接近
It has accelerated its approach.

386
00:24:56,955 --> 00:24:57,915
帮我，斯科提
Help, Scotty.

387
00:24:59,035 --> 00:24:59,635
怎么了？
What?

388
00:25:00,379 --> 00:25:02,523
抱紧我，又在发生了
Hold me. It's happening again.

389
00:25:09,987 --> 00:25:10,734
不！
No!

390
00:25:12,209 --> 00:25:12,755
米拉…
Mira...

391
00:25:16,505 --> 00:25:18,452
也许它理解另一种语言
Perhaps it understands another kind of language.

392
00:25:20,477 --> 00:25:21,362
红色警报
Condition Red Alert.

393
00:25:23,412 --> 00:25:24,464
[警报声] 准备发射相位炮
[Sirens Blaring] Prepare for phaser firing.

394
00:25:25,993 --> 00:25:26,750
米拉…
Mira...

395
00:25:27,531 --> 00:25:28,862
不，斯科提！不！
No, Scotty! No!

396
00:25:32,265 --> 00:25:33,765
[柯克] 锁定相位炮追踪控制
[Kirk] Lock in phaser tracking controls.

397
00:25:34,787 --> 00:25:35,683
已锁定，长官
Locked in, sir.

398
00:25:36,999 --> 00:25:38,125
调整相位器
Adjust phasers.

399
00:25:38,744 --> 00:25:40,812
对其航线开火，不要击中它
Fire across its course. Do not hit it.

400
00:25:43,365 --> 00:25:43,985
已锁定，长官
Locked in, sir.

401
00:25:44,211 --> 00:25:44,704
开火
Fire.

402
00:25:53,752 --> 00:25:54,866
反应，苏鲁先生？
Reaction, Mr. Sulu?

403
00:25:55,974 --> 00:25:58,265
没有，长官，他们仍在接近我们
None, sir. They're still approaching us.

404
00:26:07,639 --> 00:26:10,342
向船首开炮没有足够的震慑力
Apparently a shot across the bow is insufficiently convincing.

405
00:26:13,833 --> 00:26:16,805
准备将相位炮锁定到团体的中心
Prepare to lock phasers into the heart of the community.

406
00:26:21,813 --> 00:26:22,465
已锁定，长官
Locked in, sir.

407
00:26:22,574 --> 00:26:23,144
开火
Fire.

408
00:26:25,454 --> 00:26:26,285
斯科提！
Scotty!

409
00:26:28,173 --> 00:26:28,941
米拉！
Mira!

410
00:26:30,852 --> 00:26:31,378
米拉
Mira.

411
00:26:32,169 --> 00:26:33,890
[苏鲁] 相位枪似乎已经阻止了他们的接近
[Sulu] The phasers seem to have stopped their approach.

412
00:26:34,229 --> 00:26:35,042
他们保持不动
They're holding position.

413
00:26:36,062 --> 00:26:37,150
锁定以进行再一次攻击
Lock in for another blast.

414
00:26:38,078 --> 00:26:38,777
已锁定，长官
Locked in, sir.

415
00:26:40,005 --> 00:26:40,742
斯科提[通过对讲机] 舰长！
Scotty [Over Intercome] Captain!

416
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:46,782
舰长，相位炮的射击正在杀死米拉！
Captain, the phaser shots, they're killing Mira!

417
00:26:47,570 --> 00:26:48,544
杀死罗曼上尉？
Killing Lieutenant Romaine?

418
00:26:48,858 --> 00:26:51,670
当你发射相位炮时，他们把她吓坏了，她瘫倒了
When you fired the phasers, they stunned her and she crumpled.

419
00:26:51,768 --> 00:26:53,112
再开一枪，你就会杀了她
Another shot and you'll kill her.

420
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:56,778
马上带她去病房
Get her to Sickbay at once.

421
00:26:59,707 --> 00:27:00,672
准备好开火了，舰长
Ready for firing, Captain.

422
00:27:05,105 --> 00:27:05,897
取消那个命令
Cancel that order.

423
00:27:15,246 --> 00:27:18,432
对那个外星生物的再一次攻击将杀死罗曼上尉
Another attack on that alien life-form will kill Lieutenant Romaine.

424
00:27:18,515 --> 00:27:19,375
看起来是这样
It appears so.

425
00:27:20,005 --> 00:27:22,207
如果要她活下来，我们就不能攻击
If she is to survive, we can't attack.

426
00:27:22,335 --> 00:27:23,122
不直接攻击
Not directly.

427
00:27:23,663 --> 00:27:27,064
计算机能否根据你积累的数据提供防御？
Can the computer supply a defense based on the data you've been accumulating?

428
00:27:27,354 --> 00:27:28,052
不能，舰长
Negative, Captain.

429
00:27:28,199 --> 00:27:30,392
我还无法为此收集到足够的数据
I have not been able to gather sufficient data for that.

430
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:34,392
舰长，只有一种可能的防御
Captain, there is only one possible defense.

431
00:27:35,022 --> 00:27:38,734
如果我们能找到一个对外星生物致命的环境
If we can find an environment which is deadly to the alien form.

432
00:27:39,343 --> 00:27:41,712
而将 女孩与其致命影响隔离开来
And yet isolate the girl from its deadly effects.

433
00:27:48,855 --> 00:27:50,099
柯克舰长呼叫麦考伊医生
Captain Kirk to Dr. McCoy.

434
00:27:50,409 --> 00:27:51,009
是的，舰长
Yes, Captain.

435
00:27:51,490 --> 00:27:53,253
女孩身体够好可以接受询问吗？
Is the girl well enough to be questioned?

436
00:27:53,697 --> 00:27:55,325
麦考伊[通过对讲机] 我可以在几分钟内让她准备好
McCoy [Over Intercom] I can have her ready in a few minutes.

437
00:27:56,112 --> 00:28:00,388
尽快让上尉和斯科特先生去简报室
Have the lieutenant and Mr. Scott in the briefing room as quickly as possible.

438
00:28:00,496 --> 00:28:03,210
带上所有可用的档案材料
Bring all available biographical material with you.

439
00:28:03,667 --> 00:28:04,311
通话完毕
Kirk out.

440
00:28:04,901 --> 00:28:05,771
史波克先生，跟我来
Mr. Spock, come with me.

441
00:28:17,785 --> 00:28:19,972
对她宽容些，吉姆，她的状态很糟糕
Go easy on her, Jim. She's in a bad state.

442
00:28:19,972 --> 00:28:20,665
我尽量
I'll try.

443
00:28:24,495 --> 00:28:25,248
罗曼上尉
Lieutenant Romaine.

444
00:28:35,634 --> 00:28:37,426
我不是有意不合作的，医生
I didn't mean to be uncooperative, Doctor.

445
00:28:37,994 --> 00:28:39,808
当然，我告诉舰长了
Of course you didn't. I told the captain.

446
00:28:39,891 --> 00:28:41,616
我们必须得知道正在发生的事情
We must get to understand what's happening.

447
00:28:42,231 --> 00:28:43,383
我会告诉你我所知道的一切
I'll tell you everything I know.

448
00:28:45,259 --> 00:28:49,291
飞船的调查程序有时会让新船员感到困惑
Ship's investigative procedures are sometimes confusing to a new crewman.

449
00:28:49,499 --> 00:28:50,558
不要生我们的气
Don't let us upset you.

450
00:28:51,242 --> 00:28:52,706
我绝对信任你们所有人
I trust all of you implicitly.

451
00:28:56,556 --> 00:28:57,260
我想帮忙
I want to help.

452
00:28:57,711 --> 00:29:00,788
这项调查是由两个事件促成的
This investigation has been prompted by two events.

453
00:29:01,235 --> 00:29:03,091
首先是你在舰桥上昏倒的时候
First is the time you passed out on the bridge

454
00:29:03,896 --> 00:29:07,553
其次是我们向正在攻击我们的那支部队
and the second is when we fired our main phasers into that force

455
00:29:07,553 --> 00:29:09,812
发射主相位炮并重伤你的时候
that is attacking us and seriously injured you.

456
00:29:10,363 --> 00:29:11,832
你不必担心伤害我
You mustn't worry about hurting me.

457
00:29:12,667 --> 00:29:14,136
好的，那我们开始吧
Now, this is how we'll proceed.

458
00:29:15,193 --> 00:29:20,455
史波克先生拥有所有我们能获取的有关攻击者的信息
Mr. Spock has all the information available to us about our attackers.

459
00:29:21,859 --> 00:29:25,837
麦考伊医生可以查阅星际舰队关于你的详尽文件
Dr. McCoy has access to Starfleet's exhaustive files on you.

460
00:29:25,952 --> 00:29:29,105
两者比较可能会揭示一些不太可能的联系
A comparison of the two may turn up some improbable connection,

461
00:29:29,105 --> 00:29:32,500
这可以保护你和我们自己
which may protect you and ourselves.

462
00:29:33,118 --> 00:29:34,008
好吗，各位？
All right, gentlemen?

463
00:29:35,483 --> 00:29:36,699
麦考伊医生，你可以继续吗？
Dr. McCoy, will you proceed?

464
00:29:43,002 --> 00:29:46,958
罗曼，米拉，上尉，出生地，3号火星殖民地
Romaine, Mira, Lieutenant, place of birth, Martian Colony number 3.

465
00:29:47,101 --> 00:29:49,267
父母，莉迪亚·罗曼，已故
Parents, Lydia Romaine, deceased,

466
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:53,521
雅克·罗曼，星际舰队轮机长，退休
Jacques Romaine, chief engineer of Starfleet, retired.

467
00:29:54,268 --> 00:29:57,150
史波克先生，你准备好讲讲攻击者的历史背景了吗？
Mr. Spock, are you prepared with the background history of the attackers?

468
00:29:57,472 --> 00:29:58,134
是的，舰长
I am, Captain.

469
00:29:58,393 --> 00:30:01,029
我已将所有可获得的数据输入了主计算机
I have fed all obtainable data to the main computer.

470
00:30:01,121 --> 00:30:03,614
它应该准备好了提供任何可能的结论
It should be ready to supply whatever conclusions are possible.

471
00:30:03,955 --> 00:30:04,495
谢谢
Thank you.

472
00:30:06,026 --> 00:30:08,413
苏鲁先生，我们的朋友现在状态怎样？
Mr. Sulu, what is the status of our friends up there?

473
00:30:08,749 --> 00:30:09,863
状态不变
Status unchanged.

474
00:30:09,950 --> 00:30:11,890
他们仍然和我们一起，并保持相同的距离
They're still with us and keeping the same distance.

475
00:30:12,077 --> 00:30:13,359
继续规避机动
Continue evasive maneuvers.

476
00:30:13,985 --> 00:30:15,582
请随时通知我，通话完毕
Keep me informed. Kirk out.

477
00:30:16,784 --> 00:30:20,702
医生，你有罗曼上尉的病历吗？
Doctor, do you have a medical record of Lieutenant Romaine available?

478
00:30:20,992 --> 00:30:21,608
是的，舰长
Yes, Captain.

479
00:30:22,218 --> 00:30:25,320
我想检查一下她的心理资料中的一些项目
I'd like a few items from her psychological profile checked.

480
00:30:30,126 --> 00:30:31,734
有心身疾病史吗？
Any history of psychosomatic illness?

481
00:30:35,189 --> 00:30:37,398
青少年常规发病率为偶尔
Occasional in teenage routine incidence.

482
00:30:38,049 --> 00:30:41,377
是否有任何非自愿或无意识的心灵感应能力的证据？
Any evidence of involuntary or unconscious telepathic abilities?

483
00:30:45,819 --> 00:30:46,308
没有
None.

484
00:30:46,776 --> 00:30:51,338
任何病态或不寻常的移情反应？
Any pathological or unusual empathic responses?

485
00:30:54,592 --> 00:30:56,113
不，舰长，没有移情作用
No, Captain, not empathic.

486
00:30:57,029 --> 00:31:00,632
然而，对新的学习情境能作出极其灵活和顺从的响应
However, an extremely flexible and pliant response

487
00:31:00,632 --> 00:31:02,805
这一特质非常明显
to new learning situations is highly marked.

488
00:31:04,825 --> 00:31:05,446
继续，博士
Go ahead, Doctor.

489
00:31:05,649 --> 00:31:07,176
在我们的相位炮中那个东西后
After our phasers hit that thing,

490
00:31:07,176 --> 00:31:10,305
我对罗曼上尉进行了标准的斯坦曼分析
I gave Lieutenant Romaine a standard Steinman analysis.

491
00:31:10,372 --> 00:31:11,695
结果可能很有趣
The results might be interesting.

492
00:31:11,756 --> 00:31:12,473
嗯哼，继续
Mm-hm. Go ahead.

493
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:19,836
我们的斯坦曼与星际舰队的记录比较显示
A comparison of our Steinman with Starfleet records shows

494
00:31:19,836 --> 00:31:23,139
罗曼上尉的指纹，声音分析
that Lieutenant Romaine's fingerprints, voice analysis,

495
00:31:23,678 --> 00:31:26,723
所有外部特征都和以前一样
all external factors remain the same as before.

496
00:31:27,897 --> 00:31:30,818
然而，根据两幅超脑电图
However, according to two hyperencephalograms,

497
00:31:31,235 --> 00:31:33,087
她的脑电波模式改变了
her brainwave pattern has been altered.

498
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:38,028
这不可能
That's impossible.

499
00:31:38,598 --> 00:31:39,575
据我所知就是这样
That's what I was taught.

500
00:31:40,292 --> 00:31:43,066
但BCP与指纹一样始终不变
But the BCP is just as consistent as fingerprints.

501
00:31:43,371 --> 00:31:44,058
让我们看看
Let's see it.

502
00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:54,943
麦考伊医生，根据你的记录
Dr. McCoy, according to your records,

503
00:31:54,943 --> 00:31:58,362
罗曼上尉没有表现出异常的心灵感应能力
Lieutenant Romaine showed no abnormal telepathic powers.

504
00:31:58,683 --> 00:32:02,487
没错，史波克，但表现出非凡的顺从性
That's right, Spock, but exceptional pliancy was indicated.

505
00:32:03,929 --> 00:32:05,084
这可能是一个因素
That might be a factor.

506
00:32:05,552 --> 00:32:08,924
你确定这是正确的幻灯片？
And you're sure this is the correct slide?

507
00:32:09,659 --> 00:32:12,844
是的，史波克先生，那是磁带卡座D
Yes, Mr. Spock. That is tape deck D.

508
00:32:13,022 --> 00:32:15,709
米拉·罗曼上尉的脑回路模式
brain circuitry pattern of Lieutenant Mira Romaine.

509
00:32:15,966 --> 00:32:20,001
先生们，它也恰好是磁带H
Gentlemen, it also happens to be tape H,

510
00:32:20,497 --> 00:32:23,576
从外星生命单位那里获得的脉冲追踪
the impulse tracking obtained from the aliens life units.

511
00:32:24,930 --> 00:32:27,805
查佩尔护士每一步都盯着，不会有错误
Nurse Chapel followed this every step of the way. There can be no error.

512
00:32:28,492 --> 00:32:29,224
检查，史波克
Check it, Spock.

513
00:32:37,895 --> 00:32:42,232
正如我所说，舰长，这是上次屏蔽运行期间获得的跟踪
As I said, Captain, this is the tracking obtained during the last shielded run.

514
00:32:46,892 --> 00:32:49,319
电脑，进行详细对比
Computer, run a detailed comparison,

515
00:32:49,411 --> 00:32:53,023
脑回路模式，磁带D和磁带H
brain circuitry patterns, tape D and tape H.

516
00:32:54,286 --> 00:32:58,789
[计算机] 比较磁带D上米拉·罗曼上尉的脑回路模式
[Computer] Comparison tape D's brain circuitry patterns of Lieutenant Mira Romaine

517
00:32:58,850 --> 00:33:02,453
和磁带H，外星生命单元的脑回路模式
and tape H, brain circuitry patterns of alien life unit.

518
00:33:02,544 --> 00:33:03,285
相同
Identical.

519
00:33:03,832 --> 00:33:04,636
相同
Identical.

520
00:33:08,554 --> 00:33:09,373
真有趣
Fascinating.

521
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:14,065
没有错误
There has been no error.

522
00:33:14,381 --> 00:33:16,049
麦考伊医生是对的，舰长
Dr. McCoy is correct, Captain.

523
00:33:16,753 --> 00:33:19,128
思想的同一性正在发生
There is an identity of minds taking place

524
00:33:19,128 --> 00:33:22,380
在外星人和罗曼上尉的思想之间
between the alien beings and the mind of Lieutenant Romaine.

525
00:33:23,616 --> 00:33:27,264
他们的想法…正在变成她的想法
Their thoughts... are becoming hers.

526
00:33:34,862 --> 00:33:35,814
舰桥呼叫柯克舰长
Bridge to Captain Kirk,

527
00:33:36,175 --> 00:33:38,236
外星人不再保持距离了
the alien is no longer maintaining its distance.

528
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:40,683
继续规避动作，随时通知我，通话完毕
Continue evasive action. Keep me informed. Kirk out.

529
00:33:50,174 --> 00:33:53,950
米拉一直试图告诉我，她提前看到了事情
Mira has tried to tell me all along that she was seeing things in advance.

530
00:33:55,547 --> 00:33:56,494
你怎么不上报？
Why didn't you report it?

531
00:33:57,318 --> 00:33:59,750
没人会报告太空病，我能想到的只有这个
You don't report space sickness. That's all I thought it was.

532
00:34:01,445 --> 00:34:02,274
她看到了什么？
What did she see?

533
00:34:02,676 --> 00:34:03,943
对船的第一次攻击
The first attack on the ship.

534
00:34:05,714 --> 00:34:09,307
对阿尔法记忆的攻击和…
The attack on Memory Alpha and...

535
00:34:10,625 --> 00:34:12,178
我们差点失去她的时候
the time we nearly lost her.

536
00:34:14,456 --> 00:34:16,802
那些都是攻击者实施的行为
Those were all acts carried out by our attacker.

537
00:34:17,046 --> 00:34:17,652
还有…
And...

538
00:34:24,623 --> 00:34:25,244
还有…
And...

539
00:34:27,666 --> 00:34:28,434
是的，斯科提
Yes, Scotty.

540
00:34:31,707 --> 00:34:32,328
还有什么？
What else?

541
00:34:34,689 --> 00:34:37,604
我一时想，还有别的什么
I thought for a moment there was something else,

542
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:40,372
但我想我错了
but I guess I was wrong.

543
00:34:40,795 --> 00:34:41,950
他错了吗，上尉？
Was he wrong, Lieutenant?

544
00:34:42,505 --> 00:34:44,228
是的，还有一次
Yes, there was one other time.

545
00:34:44,932 --> 00:34:45,721
你看见什么了？
What did you see?

546
00:34:46,532 --> 00:34:47,644
我看到了斯科提
I saw Scotty.

547
00:34:48,290 --> 00:34:48,921
在哪里？
Where?

548
00:34:51,384 --> 00:34:52,259
我不知道
I don't know.

549
00:34:52,433 --> 00:34:53,237
他在做什么？
What was he doing?

550
00:35:01,826 --> 00:35:02,879
他快死了
He was dying.

551
00:35:08,319 --> 00:35:10,103
现在我明白发生了什么
Now I understand what's been happening.

552
00:35:12,670 --> 00:35:16,830
我一直在通过另一个思维看
I've been seeing through... another mind.

553
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:23,895
我被各种想法所淹没，而不是我自己的想法，它们控制着我
I've been flooded with thoughts, not my own, that control me.

554
00:35:23,895 --> 00:35:26,806
哦，斯科提，斯科提，我宁愿死也不愿伤害你
Oh, Scotty, Scotty! I'd rather die than hurt you.

555
00:35:27,055 --> 00:35:28,156
我宁愿死
I'd rather die.

556
00:35:29,014 --> 00:35:30,294
现在好了
All right, now.

557
00:35:31,510 --> 00:35:34,710
你在说什么死不死的话？
What's all this talk of dying?

558
00:35:36,169 --> 00:35:39,472
他们三番五次地对我们发号施令
They've called the turn on us three out of four times.

559
00:35:40,372 --> 00:35:43,344
任何人都不该遭受这些
That's a better average than anybody deserves.

560
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:47,461
现在轮到我们报仇了，我们要与他们战斗
It's our turn now. We'll fight them.

561
00:35:47,958 --> 00:35:52,117
所以别再说什么死亡的事情了
So let's not hear anything more about dying.

562
00:35:53,516 --> 00:35:54,725
[通讯器哔哔声]
[Communicator Bleeps]

563
00:35:54,864 --> 00:35:55,466
我是柯克
Kirk here.

564
00:35:55,953 --> 00:35:58,767
苏鲁[通过对讲机] 我是苏鲁，舰长，按照命令执行了所有的规避策略
Sulu [Over Intercom] Sulu, Captain. All evasion tactics carried out as ordered.

565
00:35:59,424 --> 00:36:00,523
你取得了什么成功？
What success did you have?

566
00:36:00,650 --> 00:36:01,668
没用，舰长
It's been useless, Captain.

567
00:36:03,474 --> 00:36:06,352
以他们现在的力量，这一次他们会突破护盾的，舰长
At their present force, they will get through the shields this time, Captain.

568
00:36:09,123 --> 00:36:10,049
曲速8，苏鲁先生
Warp 8, Mr. Sulu.

569
00:36:10,415 --> 00:36:11,056
是的，长官
Yes, sir.

570
00:36:12,552 --> 00:36:13,678
他们很快就会到的
They'll be here very soon.

571
00:36:15,539 --> 00:36:18,343
他们可能会像摧毁阿尔法记忆一样摧毁你我
They may destroy you and us as they did Memory Alpha.

572
00:36:19,259 --> 00:36:22,195
你特别容易受到他们的意志的影响
You are especially susceptible to their will.

573
00:36:22,511 --> 00:36:25,885
但我们有一次生存的机会
But we have one chance to survive.

574
00:36:26,790 --> 00:36:27,610
不要反抗
Don't resist.

575
00:36:28,648 --> 00:36:31,654
让他们开始通过你发挥作用
Let them begin to function through you.

576
00:36:33,690 --> 00:36:38,112
如果我们能控制那一刻，我们就有机会
If we can control that moment, we have a chance.

577
00:36:38,112 --> 00:36:38,723
你想试试吗？
Will you try?

578
00:36:44,168 --> 00:36:45,192
告诉我该怎么做
Tell me what to do.

579
00:36:47,771 --> 00:36:49,012
柯克舰长呼叫医学实验室
Captain Kirk to medical lab.

580
00:36:49,475 --> 00:36:50,947
男人[通过对讲机] 这里是医学实验室，长官
Man [Over Intercom] Medical lab here, sir.

581
00:36:51,338 --> 00:36:52,793
准备反重力测试装置
Prepare the antigrav test units.

582
00:36:53,134 --> 00:36:53,898
我们走
Let's go.

583
00:37:06,588 --> 00:37:08,328
注意，所有人员，注意
Attention, all personnel. Attention.

584
00:37:08,944 --> 00:37:10,544
外星力量已经渗透进了这艘船
Alien force has penetrated the ship.

585
00:37:10,756 --> 00:37:11,952
采取防御措施
Take defensive action.

586
00:37:14,847 --> 00:37:18,083
[苏鲁通过广播] 所有人员注意，外星人已经渗透进了飞船
[Sulu On PA] Attention, all personnel. Attention, the alien being has penetrated the ship.

587
00:37:18,495 --> 00:37:19,647
采取防御措施
Take defensive action.

588
00:37:21,991 --> 00:37:25,670
战斗部署，安全条件3，入侵者警报
General quarters, security condition 3, intruder alert.

589
00:37:26,215 --> 00:37:31,737
重复，战斗部署，安全条件3，入侵者警报
Repeat, general quarters, security condition 3, intruder alert.

590
00:37:44,407 --> 00:37:47,348
一旦她进入重力室，所有舱门警戒
As soon as she has entered the gravity chamber, secure all ports.

591
00:37:56,166 --> 00:37:57,403
别碰我，斯科提
Don't touch me, Scotty.

592
00:37:57,988 --> 00:37:58,708
离远点
Stay away.

593
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:09,370
[低吼]
[Growls]

594
00:38:18,953 --> 00:38:20,251
我们让她落入了敌手
We've lost her to them.

595
00:38:24,114 --> 00:38:25,156
呆着别动！
Stay where you are!

596
00:38:25,227 --> 00:38:26,789
这种状态下她可以杀了我们所有人
She could kill us all in this state.

597
00:38:27,064 --> 00:38:30,724
她会的，除非我们能完成舰长的计划
She will unless we are able to complete what the captain has planned.

598
00:38:31,501 --> 00:38:34,254
留在我们身边，米拉，请留下
Stay with us, Mira. Please stay.

599
00:38:36,005 --> 00:38:36,747
我正在努力
I'm trying.

600
00:38:40,203 --> 00:38:41,521
我想和你在一起
I want to be with you.

601
00:38:43,231 --> 00:38:44,831
他们太强了
They are too strong.

602
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:48,180
不要迷失在他们面前，坚持住
Don't lose yourself to them. Hold on.

603
00:39:00,622 --> 00:39:02,926
我是米拉·罗曼
I am Mira Romaine.

604
00:39:06,368 --> 00:39:09,086
我将成为我选择成为的人
I will be who I choose to be.

605
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:13,228
我将会…
I will...

606
00:39:13,375 --> 00:39:14,475
离远点，斯科提！
Stay away, Scotty!

607
00:39:16,856 --> 00:39:18,093
他们和我在一起
They are with me.

608
00:39:20,123 --> 00:39:21,784
他们会杀了你
They will kill you.

609
00:39:23,685 --> 00:39:24,769
别让他们这么做
You won't let them.

610
00:39:36,819 --> 00:39:38,803
她无法阻止我们
She cannot stop us.

611
00:39:39,507 --> 00:39:41,150
你无法阻止它
You cannot prevent it.

612
00:39:44,034 --> 00:39:45,968
米拉，米拉！
Mira. Mira!

613
00:39:47,708 --> 00:39:48,466
舰长
Captain.

614
00:39:49,733 --> 00:39:50,838
说话的不是米拉
That's not Mira talking.

615
00:39:50,950 --> 00:39:53,387
我们现在必须直接对付他们
Captain, we must deal with them directly now.

616
00:39:53,565 --> 00:39:56,944
当她还保留着部分自我时，我们可以与他们交谈
While she still retains partial identity, we can speak to them.

617
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:59,304
他们会用她的声音回答
They will answer using her voice.

618
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:13,243
我是星舰企业号的詹姆斯柯克舰长
I'm Captain James Kirk of the spaceship Enterprise.

619
00:40:16,019 --> 00:40:17,043
你们听得懂吗？
Do you understand?

620
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:20,731
是的，我们能听懂
Yes, we understand you.

621
00:40:21,532 --> 00:40:25,366
有个人我们已经寻找了一千年
We have searched for a millennium for one

622
00:40:25,366 --> 00:40:30,556
通过他，我们能看，能说，能听，能过上自己的生活
through whom we can see and speak and hear and live out our lives.

623
00:40:31,694 --> 00:40:32,841
你是谁？
Who are you?

624
00:40:33,485 --> 00:40:35,674
我们来自泽塔
We are from Zetar.

625
00:40:36,039 --> 00:40:38,939
那是所有类人生命都被摧毁的行星之一
That is one of the planets where all humanoid life was destroyed.

626
00:40:40,676 --> 00:40:42,407
你不可能来自泽塔
You can't be from Zetar.

627
00:40:43,077 --> 00:40:45,816
那里的所有生命很久以前就被毁灭了
All life was destroyed there long ago.

628
00:40:46,413 --> 00:40:49,883
是的，所有的物质生命都被摧毁了
Yes, all corporeal life was destroyed.

629
00:40:50,155 --> 00:40:51,065
那你是什么？
Then what are you?

630
00:40:51,415 --> 00:40:57,830
泽塔最后100人的欲望、希望、思想和意志
The desires, the hopes, the mind and the will of the last 100 of Zetar.

631
00:40:58,397 --> 00:41:01,703
我们生命的力量无法被消灭
The force of our life could not be wiped out.

632
00:41:01,889 --> 00:41:03,375
万物皆灭
All things die.

633
00:41:03,919 --> 00:41:05,737
在适当的时候
At the proper time.

634
00:41:06,453 --> 00:41:08,450
我们的星球正在死亡
Our planet was dying.

635
00:41:08,821 --> 00:41:10,957
我们决心活下去
We were determined to live on.

636
00:41:11,448 --> 00:41:17,256
在我们计划离开的关键时刻，一场突如其来的最终灾难将我们击垮
At the peak of our plans to go, a sudden final disaster struck us down.

637
00:41:18,015 --> 00:41:21,378
但我们生命的力量幸存了下来
But the force of our lives survived.

638
00:41:21,862 --> 00:41:26,050
终于，我们找到了一个可以让我们度过余生的人
At last we have found someone through whom we can live it out.

639
00:41:27,288 --> 00:41:31,527
你所占据的人的身体有自己的生活要过
The body of the one you inhabit has its own life to lead.

640
00:41:32,197 --> 00:41:34,492
她会接受我们的
She will accept ours.

641
00:41:34,877 --> 00:41:35,852
她不会
She will not.

642
00:41:36,608 --> 00:41:38,917
她在为自己的身份而战
She is fighting for her own identity.

643
00:41:39,202 --> 00:41:41,981
她的头脑会接受我们的想法
Her mind will accept our thoughts.

644
00:41:42,379 --> 00:41:45,253
我们的生命将得到满足
Our lives will be fulfilled.

645
00:41:46,519 --> 00:41:49,143
她会像阿尔法记忆上的人那样吗？
Will she learn the way the people on Memory Alpha learned?

646
00:41:49,683 --> 00:41:51,255
我们不想杀人
We did not wish to kill.

647
00:41:51,596 --> 00:41:52,595
但你确实杀人了
But you did kill.

648
00:41:53,092 --> 00:41:57,391
不，反抗我们杀了那些人
No. Resisting us killed those people.

649
00:41:58,094 --> 00:41:59,935
我们没有杀死他们
We did not kill them.

650
00:42:00,323 --> 00:42:02,890
你的生存代价太高了
The price of your survival is too high.

651
00:42:03,814 --> 00:42:05,669
我们只想要那个女孩
We only want the girl.

652
00:42:05,809 --> 00:42:06,784
你们得不到她
You can't have her.

653
00:42:07,461 --> 00:42:10,518
你们有权拥有自己的生活，而不是别人的
You're entitled to your own life, but not another's.

654
00:42:17,291 --> 00:42:20,395
[米拉的声音] 生命被赋予了我
[Mira's Voice] Life was given to me.

655
00:42:22,996 --> 00:42:27,473
这是我的，我想活下去
It is mine. I want to live it out.

656
00:42:28,767 --> 00:42:30,498
我将会…
I... will...

657
00:42:32,930 --> 00:42:37,602
女孩的生命读数正在接近泽塔人的，她快不行了
The girl's life reading is becoming a match to the Zetarians. She's losing.

658
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:41,795
[外星人的声音] 不要反抗我们
[Alien Voice] Do not fight us.

659
00:42:42,246 --> 00:42:43,971
他们不会接受自己的死亡
They will not accept their own deaths.

660
00:42:48,402 --> 00:42:49,629
强迫他们接受
They'll be forced to accept it.

661
00:42:50,524 --> 00:42:53,058
你们都会死
You will all die.

662
00:42:53,569 --> 00:42:56,216
舰长，如果我们不能完成计划
Captain, if we cannot complete the plan,

663
00:42:56,369 --> 00:42:57,742
他们就会实施他们的威胁
they will carry out their threat.

664
00:42:58,141 --> 00:42:59,745
我们必须让她进压力室
We must get her into the pressure chamber.

665
00:43:00,441 --> 00:43:05,629
吉姆，你意识到杀死泽塔人所需的压力也可能会杀死这个女孩
Jim, you realize the pressure needed to kill the Zetars might kill the girl, too.

666
00:43:10,047 --> 00:43:11,691
米拉不会杀我
Mira will not kill me.

667
00:43:36,806 --> 00:43:38,516
[呐喊]
[Shouts]

668
00:43:47,393 --> 00:43:50,311
我告诉过你她不会杀我
I told you she wouldn't kill me.

669
00:43:50,557 --> 00:43:51,591
封锁压力室
Secure the chamber.

670
00:43:57,150 --> 00:43:58,989
中和重力
Neutralize gravity.

671
00:44:09,223 --> 00:44:10,815
泽塔人变得更强大了
The Zetars grow stronger.

672
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:13,754
失重状态已成为他们的自然状态
The weightless state has become their natural condition.

673
00:44:15,233 --> 00:44:16,329
给装置加压
Pressurize the unit.

674
00:44:22,132 --> 00:44:23,624
将压力增加到两个大气压
Bring pressures to two atmospheres

675
00:44:23,817 --> 00:44:25,747
并每秒增加一个大气压
and increase one atmosphere per second.

676
00:44:45,674 --> 00:44:46,828
继续增加压力
Continue increasing pressure.

677
00:45:06,284 --> 00:45:08,042
压力，史波克，压力
Pressure, Spock. Pressure.

678
00:45:12,481 --> 00:45:15,259
压力非常大，舰长
The pressure is dangerously high, Captain.

679
00:45:17,043 --> 00:45:18,071
这可能会伤害她
It may damage her.

680
00:45:21,056 --> 00:45:22,091
继续，史波克
Continue, Spock.

681
00:46:08,034 --> 00:46:08,933
压力
Pressure.

682
00:46:20,890 --> 00:46:22,963
我们做到了，吉姆，他们走了
We've done it, Jim. They're gone.

683
00:46:29,613 --> 00:46:31,583
好了，米拉，他们走了
It's all right, Mira. They're gone.

684
00:46:34,190 --> 00:46:35,231
他们走了
They're gone.

685
00:46:44,916 --> 00:46:47,732
非常非常渐进地降低压力，史波克
Reduce the pressure very very gradually, Spock.

686
00:46:48,558 --> 00:46:51,054
我们可能会消耗斯科特先生的耐心，医生
We may tax Mr. Scott's patience, Doctor.

687
00:47:05,911 --> 00:47:08,346
完全静止地躺着，尽量不要移动
Lie perfectly still. Try not to move at all.

688
00:47:09,048 --> 00:47:11,401
深呼吸，有规律地呼吸
Take deep, regular breaths.

689
00:47:12,451 --> 00:47:13,307
别憋着
Don't hold it.

690
00:47:14,461 --> 00:47:15,949
继续深呼吸
Continue to breathe deeply.

691
00:47:16,723 --> 00:47:17,808
吸气
In...

692
00:47:18,262 --> 00:47:19,157
呼气
out.

693
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:20,590
吸气
In...

694
00:47:21,426 --> 00:47:22,103
呼气
out.

695
00:47:22,547 --> 00:47:23,270
就这样
That's it.

696
00:47:23,812 --> 00:47:25,672
你将在那里再待20分钟，
You'll be in there another 20 minutes, 

697
00:47:25,756 --> 00:47:27,240
所以请尽量放松
so why don't you Just try to relax?

698
00:47:32,557 --> 00:47:34,453
现在我们拥有世界上所有的时间
Now we have all the time in the world.

699
00:47:58,461 --> 00:48:01,393
老骨头，你能判断对罗曼上尉的长期影响吗？
Bones, are you able to judge the long-range effects on Lieutenant Romaine??

700
00:48:02,009 --> 00:48:05,967
当涉及到人的个性时，预测是危险的
When the personality of a human is involved, exact predictions are hazardous.

701
00:48:06,613 --> 00:48:08,647
特别是在涉及人类的情况下
Particularly where humans are involved.

702
00:48:08,865 --> 00:48:12,616
然而，尽管星际舰队对上尉的判断是顺从
However, despite Starfleet judgment of the pliancy of the lieutenant,

703
00:48:12,961 --> 00:48:15,562
她还是进行了英勇的斗争，以保持自己的身份
she put up a valiant struggle to retain her identity 

704
00:48:15,593 --> 00:48:16,875
我觉得这很令人鼓舞
and I find that encouraging.

705
00:48:17,290 --> 00:48:18,938
麦考伊医生是对的
Dr. McCoy is correct.

706
00:48:19,893 --> 00:48:21,624
虽然真相让人难以接受
While the truth was difficult to accept,

707
00:48:21,624 --> 00:48:24,047
但当它被揭露时，她反应良好
when it was revealed, she reacted well.

708
00:48:24,530 --> 00:48:28,948
我会说这次经历会加强她的整个自我意识结构
I would say her struggle in this would strengthen her entire ego structure.

709
00:48:29,167 --> 00:48:33,518
你们有人会把斯科提对的她坚定不移的信念视为一个因素吗？
Would either of you credit Scotty's steadfast belief in her as a factor?

710
00:48:33,876 --> 00:48:36,975
你是说…爱是动力？
You mean... love as motivation?

711
00:48:40,297 --> 00:48:43,881
人类确实对这种特殊的情感要求很高
Humans do claim a great deal for that particular emotion.

712
00:48:45,020 --> 00:48:47,700
我想这是可能的，然而…
I suppose it is possible. However...

713
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:49,796
没有然而，史波克先生
There are no howevers about it, Mr. Spock..

714
00:48:49,796 --> 00:48:53,321
它就是，而且也将是她康复的一个因素
It was a factor and it will be a factor in the girl's recovery.

715
00:48:54,168 --> 00:48:56,337
我是否可以认为你们俩都同意
Do I take it both of you agree

716
00:48:56,682 --> 00:48:59,870
罗曼上尉不需要回星际基地进一步治疗？
that Lieutenant Romaine need not return to star base for further treatment?

717
00:49:00,215 --> 00:49:02,467
嗯，我有理由相信工作是一种更好的治疗方法
Well, I should think work would be a better therapy.

718
00:49:02,977 --> 00:49:04,058
合理
Logical.

719
00:49:07,448 --> 00:49:08,921
柯克舰长呼叫斯科特先生
Captain Kirk to Mr. Scott.

720
00:49:09,219 --> 00:49:09,968
我是斯科特，长官
Scott here, sir.

721
00:49:10,294 --> 00:49:12,005
斯科特先生，罗曼上尉怎么样？
Mr. Scott, how's Lieutenant Romaine?

722
00:49:12,191 --> 00:49:13,305
漂亮，舰长
Beautiful, Captain.

723
00:49:13,425 --> 00:49:14,340
好的，斯科特先生
Yes, Mr. Scott.

724
00:49:14,380 --> 00:49:17,657
我能否理解为她可以工作了？
Do I take it you say that she is fit for duty?

725
00:49:17,955 --> 00:49:19,315
当然，舰长
Positively, Captain.

726
00:49:19,474 --> 00:49:20,345
谢谢
Thank you.

727
00:49:21,378 --> 00:49:22,260
柯克呼叫舰桥
Kirk to bridge.

728
00:49:22,473 --> 00:49:23,222
我是苏鲁，舰长
Sulu, Captain.

729
00:49:23,428 --> 00:49:25,670
苏鲁先生，设定到阿尔法记忆的航线
Mr. Sulu, set course for Memory Alpha.

730
00:49:25,696 --> 00:49:27,527
罗曼上尉有很多工作要做
Lieutenant Romaine has a lot of work to do.

731
00:49:27,527 --> 00:49:28,071
是的，长官
Yes, sir.

732
00:49:28,678 --> 00:49:32,359
嗯，这是企业号上首次
Well, this is an Enterprise first.

733
00:49:34,519 --> 00:49:37,975
麦考伊医生，史波克先生和轮机长斯科特
Dr. McCoy, Mr. Spock and Engineer Scott

734
00:49:38,081 --> 00:49:40,624
达成一致意见
find themselves in complete agreement.

735
00:49:41,358 --> 00:49:42,920
我能承受这种压力吗？
Can I stand the strain?
