9
00:00:33,221 --> 00:00:36,641
<i>传感器无法准确定位</i>

10
00:00:36,808 --> 00:00:40,395
- <i>我要检查电路</i>  - 你试试

乌乎拉，求救信号的位置
Uhura, does the location of the distress call

12
00:00:43,398 --> 00:00:45,817
与这个区域完全对应吗？

13
00:00:45,984 --> 00:00:48,820
是的，先生，我仍在接收可视通讯
Yes, sir. I'm still receiving visual contact.

14
00:00:48,987 --> 00:00:51,072
我可以看到他们，但我看不到你
I can see them but I can't see you.

15
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:56,911
- <i>是同一个区域吗？</i>  - 坐标一致，舰长
- <i>Is it the same area?</i> - Coordinates correspond, Captain.

00:01:12,302 --> 00:01:17,849
这是一个荒芜的世界，几乎没有任何植被，没有动物
This is a barren world. There's hardly any vegetation, no animal life.

21
00:01:18,016 --> 00:01:20,852
我们应该有一些解释
We should have some explanation.

22
00:01:21,144 --> 00:01:23,479

But there is an insect life.

23
00:01:23,646 --> 00:01:28,735
- 我的三录仪没显示  - 我听到了

29
00:01:48,546 --> 00:01:51,174
而其他建筑物则早已废弃
while others are long abandoned.

30
00:01:51,341 --> 00:01:55,803
- 没有存在生命的迹象？  - 读数显示有生命形式

31
00:01:55,970 --> 00:01:58,848
但不寻常且断断续续

32
00:01:59,015 --> 00:02:01,893
它们没有可辨别的形式或位置

33
00:02:02,143 --> 00:02:05,730

51
00:04:08,478 --> 00:04:12,148

61
00:04:52,688 --> 00:04:56,025
我假设这个求救信号是预先录制的
I assume this distress call was pre-recorded.

62
00:04:56,192 --> 00:04:59,320
我们收到的是一条延迟的录音消息
What we received was a delayed taped message.

63
00:04:59,487 --> 00:05:01,948
这就是为什么我们收到它
That's why we received it

64
00:05:02,114 --> 00:05:04,700
而我们的传感器只收到登陆小队
while our sensors picked up only the landing party.

65
00:05:04,867 --> 00:05:08,204
当我们传送下去时，我们找不到那些人
When we beamed down, we couldn't find those people.

他们原来在那里，现在不在了，但康普顿不是
They were there, now they're not. Nor is Compton.

67
00:05:12,083 --> 00:05:14,627
似乎是某种力量或媒介
It would seem that some force or agent

68
00:05:14,794 --> 00:05:17,296
我们的仪器只能部分识别
only partly discernible to our instruments

69
00:05:17,463 --> 00:05:19,799

当我们继续调查时，我希望这艘船处于待命状态
I want the ship on standby alert while we continue the investigation.

71
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:30,643
现在我有读数表明护盾不起作用
Now I have readings that the deflectors are inoperative.

72

斯科提，帮忙
Scotty, assist.

73
00:05:37,692 --> 00:05:41,028
自从我们传送上来后，就出现了故障
Ever since we beamed up we've had malfunctions.

74
00:05:41,195 --> 00:05:44,949
我要一份调查和说明报告

- What do you read so far? - <i>Can we discuss it here?</i>

79
00:05:57,295 --> 00:06:00,214
我来了，史波克先生，你指挥
On my way. Mr. Spock, you have the conn.

80
00:06:04,093 --> 00:06:06,429
- 怎么了？  - 告诉他
- What is it? - Tell him.

81
00:06:06,595 --> 00:06:10,850
有人打开了所有的医疗用品柜
Somebody's opened all the medical supply cabinets.

82
00:06:11,017 --> 00:06:13,269
- 有什么丢了吗？  - 没有
- Anything missing? - No.

83
00:06:13,436 --> 00:06:17,440
就好像有人拿起所有东西研究了一番
It's just as though someone had picked up everything.

84
00:06:17,606 --> 00:06:21,319
- 躺下  - 这与其他干扰相吻合
- Lie down. - That fits with other disturbances.

85
00:06:29,452 --> 00:06:33,289
老骨头，其他人的读数是什么？
Bones, what did your readings show up on the other men?

86
00:06:33,456 --> 00:06:34,874
一切正常
All normal.

87
00:06:35,041 --> 00:06:38,502
发生在康普顿身上的事情对其他人都没有影响
Whatever happened to Compton had no effect on anyone else.

88
00:06:39,837 --> 00:06:43,841
他们中有人报告在传送后有什么不寻常的经历吗？
Any of them report any unusual experience since beaming up?

89
00:06:44,008 --> 00:06:46,177
不，没有人提到
No, there's no mention of it.

骨头，会不会有什么东西让我产生幻觉？
Bones, could something be making me hallucinate?

93
00:07:10,576 --> 00:07:13,371
你是什​​么意思？
What do you mean?

94
00:07:13,537 --> 00:07:18,834
之前有过两次，什么东西触碰了我，但周围什么都没有
Twice before, something touched me, and there was nothing there.

95
00:07:20,503 --> 00:07:22,797
刚刚又发生了
And it's just happened again.

96
00:07:22,963 --> 00:07:26,258
是我的想象吗？
Could I be imagining it?

97
00:07:26,425 --> 00:07:29,470
身体上，你没有任何问题
Physically, there's nothing wrong with you.

98
00:07:29,637 --> 00:07:32,348
但是我是不是出现幻觉了？
But am I hallucinating?

99
00:07:32,515 --> 00:07:34,975
我猜不是
I'd say no.

100
00:07:38,312 --> 00:07:40,731
那我们一定传送了什么东西上船
Then we did beam something aboard.

- <i>Alien substances being introduced.</i> - Meet me on the double.

112
00:08:24,733 --> 00:08:28,654
- 史波克？  - 这是一个陌生的力场

113
00:08:29,947 --> 00:08:34,785
有一个和星球表面类似的外星人存在
There's an alien presence similar to that on the planet's surface.

114
00:08:34,952 --> 00:08:39,540
- 但它没有确切的位置  - 相位枪击晕模式，搜索这个区域
- But it has no exact location. - Phasers on stun. Sweep the area.

115
00:08:54,472 --> 00:08:59,143
看来他们打算只让我们两个人进去
It seems that they intend to allow only the two of us to enter.

116
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:01,937
我建议谨慎行事
I should advise caution.

117
00:09:19,246 --> 00:09:22,416

不知道，舰长，但它显然是外星来源的装置

<i>数据不足以确定最终目的</i>
<i>Data insufficient for determination of end purpose.</i>

140
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:04,476
这和康普顿的失踪有关系吗？
Is there a connection between this and Compton's disappearance?

141
00:11:04,643 --> 00:11:09,648
- <i>数据不足</i>  - 我们有能力抵抗吗？
- <i>Data insufficient.</i> - Are we capable of resisting?

142
00:11:09,815 --> 00:11:13,068
- <i>没有</i>  - 你的建议？
- <i>Negative.</i> - Your recommendations?

143
00:11:13,235 --> 00:11:18,324
<i>如果无法抵抗，可以谈判条件</i>
<i>If incapable of resistance, negotiate for terms.</i>

144
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:22,703
- 我们不会谈判，你同意吗？  - 是的
- We will not negotiate. You concur? - Aye.

145
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:25,664
你的建议，舰长？
Your recommendations, Captain?

146
00:11:26,457 --> 00:11:31,170
在喝咖啡还是电路也损坏了？
Is that coffee available or have those circuits been damaged as well?

147
00:11:32,921 --> 00:11:37,092
我的建议？让他们采取下一步行动
My recommendation? Make them take the next step.

148
00:13:07,641 --> 00:13:09,184
史波克？
Spock?

149
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:14,648
舰长
Captain.

150
00:13:25,325 --> 00:13:27,870
介意解释一下吗…
Would you mind explaining...

151
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:35,836
- 你是谁？  - 迪拉，敌人
- Who are you? - Deela. The enemy.

152
00:13:43,302 --> 00:13:45,763
- 你是敌人？  - 是的
- You're the enemy? - Yes.

153
00:13:45,929 --> 00:13:48,766
你亲自传送我上船的
You beamed me aboard yourself.

154
00:13:48,932 --> 00:13:52,352
漫长得出奇的过程，但我搞定了
Ridiculously long process, but I've taken care of it.

155
00:13:52,519 --> 00:13:55,856
- 你对我的人做了什么？  - 没有什么
- What have you done with my men? - Nothing.

156
00:13:57,399 --> 00:14:00,319
史波克先生？
Mr. Spock?

157
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:05,657
斯科提？
Scotty?

158
00:14:05,824 --> 00:14:09,661
- 这是没什么？  - 他们没有任何问题
- This is nothing? - There's nothing wrong with them.

159
00:14:09,828 --> 00:14:12,831
他们一如往常
They are just as they have always been.

160
00:14:12,998 --> 00:14:15,584
不一样的是你
It's you who are different.

161
00:14:15,751 --> 00:14:18,045
上尉
Lieutenant.

162
00:14:18,212 --> 00:14:20,672
苏鲁
Sulu.

163
00:14:20,839 --> 00:14:22,132
这是没问题？
This is nothing?

164
00:14:22,299 --> 00:14:26,303
在他们的耳朵里，你听起来像一只昆虫
To their ears you sound like an insect.

165
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:31,767
这就是你的描述，舰长，坦率地说，很准确
That's your description, Captain. Accurate, if unflattering.

166
00:14:31,934 --> 00:14:35,395
真的，他们没有任何问题
Really, there is nothing wrong with them.

167
00:14:35,562 --> 00:14:39,441
- 你做了什么？  - 改变了你
- What have you done? - Changed you.

168
00:14:39,608 --> 00:14:41,652
你现在和我一样
You are like me now.

169
00:14:41,819 --> 00:14:48,200
由于加速，你的船员无法看到你或我们中的任何人
Your crew cannot see you or any of us because of the acceleration.

170
00:14:48,367 --> 00:14:51,119
我们眨眼之间就移动了
We move in the wink of an eye.

171
00:14:51,286 --> 00:14:54,790
对此有科学的解释
There is a scientific explanation for it.

172
00:14:54,957 --> 00:14:59,419
但真正重要的是你能看到我
But all that really matters is that you can see me,

173
00:14:59,586 --> 00:15:02,214
和我说话
and talk to me,

174
00:15:02,381 --> 00:15:06,635
而且…我们可以从那里继续
and... we can go on from there.

175
00:15:08,554 --> 00:15:14,768
- 为什么？  - 因为我喜欢你，你没有猜到吗？
- Why? - Because I like you. Didn't you guess?

176
00:15:14,935 --> 00:15:18,730
还是说你习惯被隐形的女人亲吻？
Or are you used to being kissed by invisible women?

177
00:15:26,029 --> 00:15:28,115
迪拉
Deela.

178
00:15:33,203 --> 00:15:35,998
这就是你破坏我的​​飞船的原因吗？
Is this why you sabotaged my ship?

179
00:15:36,164 --> 00:15:42,880
它没有被破坏，我们不得不做出一些改变来调整它
It has not been sabotaged. We had to make some changes to adjust it to us.

180
00:15:43,046 --> 00:15:45,591
- 你说“我们”  - 是的，当然
- You said "we". - Yes, of course.

181
00:15:45,757 --> 00:15:49,219
我的首席科学家和他的团队
My chief scientist and his crew.

182
00:15:49,386 --> 00:15:52,055
我是他们的女王
I am their queen.

183
00:15:52,222 --> 00:15:55,601
你将成为他们的国王
You are going to be their king.

184
00:15:55,767 --> 00:15:58,145
您将享受生活在斯卡罗斯的乐趣
You'll enjoy living on Scalos.

185
00:16:00,272 --> 00:16:02,900
我的飞船？我的船员怎么办？
What about my ship? My crew?

186
00:16:03,066 --> 00:16:07,404
一会儿他们就会意识到你消失了
In a few of their moments, they will realize that you've vanished.

187
00:16:07,571 --> 00:16:11,325
他们会找你，但他们不会找到你
They will look for you, but they will not find you.

188
00:16:11,742 --> 00:16:14,703
你的速度超出了他们的视觉能力
You're accelerated beyond their power to see.

189
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:17,039
所以他们会在没有你的情况下继续前进
So they'll go on without you.

190
00:16:17,205 --> 00:16:21,710
不要那么固执，你永远不能回到他们身边
Don't be so stubborn. You cannot go back to them, ever.

191
00:16:24,463 --> 00:16:27,841
前景有那么可怕吗？
Is it so dreadful a prospect?

192
00:16:30,177 --> 00:16:33,764
这不会杀死你，但眩晕效果不是很愉快
This won't kill you, but the stun effect is not very pleasant.

193
00:16:33,931 --> 00:16:37,559
[笑]但这行不通
[LAUGHS] But that won't work.

194
00:16:37,726 --> 00:16:39,937
你继续，试试
You go ahead. Try.

195
00:16:42,439 --> 00:16:44,942
直接指着我
Point it right at me.

196
00:16:49,529 --> 00:16:53,116
对于这种粗糙的武器，我的反应太快了
My reactions are much too fast for such a crude weapon.

197
00:16:53,283 --> 00:16:56,620
而且我也很擅长自卫
And I am quite good at self-defense, too.

198
00:16:59,206 --> 00:17:02,209
这个也可以设定为击晕和摧毁
This can be set for stun and destroy, too.

199
00:17:06,546 --> 00:17:09,800
请接受已经发生的事情
Please. Accept what has happened.

200
00:17:09,967 --> 00:17:12,427
你无法改变它
There is nothing you can do to change it.

201
00:17:23,563 --> 00:17:28,318
如果我同意和你走，你会让飞船恢复正常
If I agree to go with you, will you set this ship to rights,

202
00:17:28,485 --> 00:17:30,988
拿走生命支持系统中的那个装置吗？
take out that device in life-support?

203
00:17:31,154 --> 00:17:35,826
别傻了，过一阵你就感觉好多了
Don't be silly. You'll feel better about it all in a while.

204
00:17:35,993 --> 00:17:40,998
总是这样，他们一开始很不高兴
It always happens this way. They are very upset at first.

205
00:17:41,164 --> 00:17:46,837
然后慢慢平息，然后…学会喜欢它
Then it wears off, then they... they learn to like it.

206
00:17:47,004 --> 00:17:50,007
你也会的
You will, too.

207
00:17:57,806 --> 00:18:01,601
他正在向你走来，对他温柔点
He's on his way to you. Be gentle with him.

208
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:06,940
舰长…柯克舰长！他走了
Captain... Captain Kirk! He's gone.

209
00:18:08,275 --> 00:18:14,197
- 你看到发生了什么吗？  - 他喝了咖啡，放下杯子
- Did you see what happened? - He drank his coffee and set it down.

210
00:18:14,406 --> 00:18:18,493
- 然后他消失了  - 苏鲁先生，你确认了吗？
- And then he vanished. - Mr. Sulu, do you verify?

211
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:22,831
是的，他在那里，然后突然他就不在那里了
Yes. He was there, then all of a sudden he wasn't there.

212
00:18:28,545 --> 00:18:32,049
- 你成功了  - 康普顿，他们加速了你
- You've made it. - Compton. They've accelerated you.

213
00:18:32,215 --> 00:18:36,053
他们把什么东西接入了生命支持系统
They've hooked something into life-support.

214
00:18:36,219 --> 00:18:39,222
- 我们必须把它弄走  - 禁止进入
- We must get rid of it. - Entry is forbidden.

215
00:18:39,389 --> 00:18:42,225
- 谁的命令？  - 指挥官
- By whose order? - The commander.

216
00:18:42,434 --> 00:18:45,812
我是你的指挥官，我命令你让我进去
I am your commander. I order you to let me in.

217
00:18:45,979 --> 00:18:49,566
- 抱歉，你已经不是了  - 谁是？迪拉？
- I'm sorry. You are no longer. - Who is? Deela?

218
00:18:49,733 --> 00:18:52,569
你替她工作吗？
Is that who you're working for?

219
00:18:53,987 --> 00:18:57,657
一开始我拒绝了，但后来我控制不住自己
At first I refused, but then I couldn't help myself.

220
00:18:57,824 --> 00:19:02,746
我遇见了这个女孩，她是他们中的一员，我从来不知道有像她这样的人
I met this girl. She's one of them. I've never known anyone like her.

221
00:19:02,913 --> 00:19:05,749
我给他们展示了这艘船的操作
I showed them the operation of the ship.

222
00:19:06,374 --> 00:19:08,168
舰桥控制，生命支持系统
Bridge controls, life-support.

223
00:19:08,335 --> 00:19:11,421
她解释说他们想知道
She explained that they wanted to know.

224
00:19:11,588 --> 00:19:17,928
一开始我不明白，但现在我明白了，你也会明白的，长官
I didn't understand at first, but I do now. So will you, sir.

225
00:19:18,095 --> 00:19:21,264
好吧，康普顿
All right, Compton.

226
00:19:24,851 --> 00:19:26,686
击晕
Stun.

227
00:19:38,907 --> 00:19:42,285
你被命令阻止他，你为什么不服从？
You were ordered to stop him. Why did you disobey?

228
00:19:42,452 --> 00:19:45,080
我试图阻止他
I tried to stop him.

229
00:19:46,498 --> 00:19:49,626
- 你伤害了他  - 他必须被制服
- You hurt him. - He had to be subdued.

230
00:19:49,793 --> 00:19:52,504
他是我的…舰长
He was my... captain.

231
00:19:54,297 --> 00:19:56,633
细胞损伤
Cell damage.

232
00:19:57,926 --> 00:20:00,804
另一个对你很安全
Another will be secured for you.

233
00:20:04,808 --> 00:20:08,145
我得到一个与星球上相似的读数
I'm getting a reading similar to that on the planet.

234
00:20:08,311 --> 00:20:11,606
- 苏鲁先生，你喝咖啡了吗？  - 是的
- Mr. Sulu, did you drink your coffee? - Yes.

235
00:20:11,773 --> 00:20:14,442
- 其他人呢？  - 我喝了一些
- Did anyone else? - I had some.

236
00:20:14,609 --> 00:20:20,657
- 我可以吗？  - 是咖啡吗？我们也会消失吗？
- May I? - Was it the coffee? Will we go, too?

237
00:20:20,824 --> 00:20:24,578
在分析完这些之前我不会知道
I won't know until these have been analyzed.

238
00:20:24,744 --> 00:20:28,123
- 那就太迟了  - 记住舰长的话
- Then it'll be too late. - Recall the captain's words.

239
00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:32,335
“让他们采取下一步行动”，他们已经采取了
"Make them take the next step." They have taken it.

240
00:20:32,544 --> 00:20:36,131
我们必须确定有效的对策
And we must determine effective counter measures.

241
00:20:36,298 --> 00:20:40,051
斯科特先生，你来指挥，我去实验室
Mr. Scott, you have the conn. I shall be in the lab.

242
00:20:45,015 --> 00:20:48,310
我讨厌他们受损后的发生的事情
I hate what happens when they're damaged.

243
00:20:48,476 --> 00:20:50,687
你必须控制你的脾气
You must control your temper.

244
00:20:50,854 --> 00:20:53,565
我不希望这种情况发生在这个人身上
I do not want that to happen to this one.

245
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:59,362
如果他们是一个如此顽固的物种，也许他们能坚持更长时间
If they are so stubborn a species, perhaps they will last longer.

246
00:21:01,448 --> 00:21:05,368
- 可能吧  - 但愿如此
- It may be. - I hope so.

247
00:21:05,535 --> 00:21:10,832
他们都这么快就走了，我想长期留着这个，他很漂亮
They all go so soon. I want to keep this one a long time. He's pretty.

248
00:21:12,709 --> 00:21:18,048
- 他是低等的，迪拉  - 我不这么认为
- He is inferior, Deela. - I don't think so.

249
00:21:18,215 --> 00:21:21,218
你不能让自己迷恋上他
You cannot allow yourself to feel attached.

250
00:21:21,384 --> 00:21:25,388
我可以随心所欲
I can allow myself anything I want.

251
00:21:25,555 --> 00:21:30,477
雷尔，别这样，我嫉妒你的所作所为吗？
Rael, don't be like that. Am I jealous of what you do?

252
00:21:30,644 --> 00:21:33,897
- 我履行我的职责  - 我也是
- I do my duty. - So do I.

253
00:21:34,064 --> 00:21:37,484
有时我允许自己享受它
And sometimes I allow myself to enjoy it.

254
00:21:39,319 --> 00:21:41,238
你好
Hello.

255
00:21:47,869 --> 00:21:50,538
那个设备在我的船上做什么？
What is that device doing on my ship?

256
00:21:51,748 --> 00:21:54,042
迪拉会解释的
Deela will explain it.

257
00:21:57,671 --> 00:22:01,383
我会告诉你一切，你会同意的
I will tell you everything, and you'll approve of it.

258
00:22:01,549 --> 00:22:04,844
同意？我们是你的俘虏
Approve of it? We're your prisoners.

259
00:22:05,011 --> 00:22:08,181
并不是，你可以自由地去任何你想去的地方
Hardly. You're free to go anywhere you want to.

260
00:22:17,274 --> 00:22:19,276
去吧，舰长
Go ahead, Captain.

261
00:22:19,442 --> 00:22:24,447
它尚未完全连接，但它处于运行状态
It is not yet completely linked, but it is in operating order.

262
00:22:24,656 --> 00:22:29,786
如果你愿意，研究它，我建议你不要碰它
Study it if you wish. I suggest that you do not touch it.

263
00:22:51,099 --> 00:22:56,438
他告诉你不要碰它，看看你的手，几乎被冻僵了
He told you not to touch it. Look at your hands. They're almost frozen.

264
00:22:56,604 --> 00:22:57,731
会好的
It will pass.

265
00:22:57,981 --> 00:23:01,818
它有自己的自卫机制
It has its own self-defense mechanism.

266
00:23:01,985 --> 00:23:04,654
你应该听我的
You should have heeded me.

267
00:23:10,243 --> 00:23:14,998
在你与康普顿的斗争中，他的一些细胞被损坏了
In your struggle with Compton, some of his cells were damaged.

268
00:23:21,838 --> 00:23:25,967
新加速人的对细胞损伤很敏感
Those newly accelerated are sensitive to cell damage.

269
00:23:26,134 --> 00:23:29,346
他们会很快衰老并死亡
They age very rapidly and die.

270
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:40,357
- 他还那么年轻  - 曾经
- He was so young. - Was.

271
00:23:40,523 --> 00:23:45,362
- 这就是你为我们计划的？  - 我们都会死，即使在斯卡罗斯
- This is what you have planned for us? - We all die. Even on Scalos.

272
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:50,950
你为什么要骗他？
Why did you lie to him?

273
00:23:51,117 --> 00:23:55,622
- 他没有伤害那个人，是你  - 也许他现在会少一些暴力
- He did not damage that one. You did. - Perhaps he will be less violent now.

274
00:23:55,789 --> 00:23:59,501
- 为什么让他感觉更糟？  - 你为什么在乎？
- Why make him feel worse? - Why do you care?

275
00:23:59,667 --> 00:24:03,713
雷尔，他不是我们中的一员，他只是暂时的
Rael, he's not one of us. He's temporary.

276
00:24:04,881 --> 00:24:06,841
他去了实验室
He's gone to the laboratory.

277
00:24:07,008 --> 00:24:10,553
他正在尝试与瓦肯人交流
He's trying to communicate with the Vulcan.

278
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,973
他的物种能够产生很多感情
His species is capable of much affection.

279
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:19,396
- 我已经注意到了  - 我想知道他们是否会向我们展示它
- I have noted that. - I wonder if they'll show it to us.

280
00:24:21,147 --> 00:24:24,192
哦，雷尔，别生闷气了
Oh, Rael, stop sulking.

281
00:24:24,359 --> 00:24:29,406
接受现实吧，我们一辈子都得接受现实
Accept it. We've had to accept it all our lives.

282
00:24:29,572 --> 00:24:32,867
不要让事情变得更糟
Don't make it worse.

283
00:24:39,874 --> 00:24:42,585
回去工作
Go back to work.

284
00:24:49,050 --> 00:24:51,344
柯克呼叫史波克
Kirk to Spock.

285
00:24:51,511 --> 00:24:57,392
我已将所有可查明的事实输入计算机库
I have fed all the ascertainable facts into the computer banks.

286
00:25:02,772 --> 00:25:05,775
去吧，你不会有任何成就
Go ahead. You won't accomplish anything,

287
00:25:05,942 --> 00:25:09,195
但它可能具有历史价值
but it may be historically valuable.

288
00:25:10,530 --> 00:25:13,116
超加速是关键
Hyperacceleration is the key.

289
00:25:13,324 --> 00:25:16,744
我只数到了五，但他们已经接管了这艘船
I have counted only five but they have taken over the ship,

290
00:25:16,911 --> 00:25:21,749
由于这种加速，我们处于他们的控制之下
and we are under their control due to this acceleration.

291
00:25:21,916 --> 00:25:26,129
他们能够加速其他人达到他们的级别
They are able to speed others up to their level,

292
00:25:26,296 --> 00:25:28,298
正如康普顿和我
as they did Compton and me.

293
00:25:28,465 --> 00:25:31,968
据推测，这是一种奴役方式
Presumably, this is enslavement.

294
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:36,890
那些被如此对待的人
Those so treated

295
00:25:37,056 --> 00:25:40,977
存在于这种加速的级别
exist at this accelerated level,

296
00:25:41,144 --> 00:25:45,982
最终变得…温顺
becoming... docile eventually.

297
00:25:47,942 --> 00:25:51,946
- 但是当…  - 受伤时
- But when... - Damaged.

298
00:25:52,113 --> 00:25:57,994
…受伤时，他们衰老得非常快
...damaged, they age incredibly fast,

299
00:25:58,161 --> 00:26:00,955
仿佛加速的生活…
as though accelerated living...

300
00:26:01,122 --> 00:26:05,418
- 耗尽了他们  - …耗尽了他们
- Burns them out. - ...burns them out.

301
00:26:05,585 --> 00:26:09,005
康普顿被耗尽了
Compton was burned out.

302
00:26:09,172 --> 00:26:12,759
连接到生命支持系统的装置
The device attached to the life-support systems

303
00:26:12,926 --> 00:26:16,513
产生一种极度的，麻木的寒冷
produces an extreme, numbing cold.

304
00:26:16,679 --> 00:26:20,016
我认为他们正在把<i>企业号</i>变成
I believe they are turning the <i>Enterprise</i>

305
00:26:20,183 --> 00:26:23,394
一个巨大的深度冷冻的…
into a gigantic deep-freeze...

306
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:29,651
目的只有斯卡洛人知道
for purposes only the Scalosians know.

307
00:26:29,817 --> 00:26:32,111
相当正确
Quite correct.

308
00:26:32,278 --> 00:26:38,868
该装置有一个防护罩，不允许任何物理接触
The unit has a protective shield which does not allow any physical contact.

309
00:26:39,035 --> 00:26:45,208
我不知道如何摧毁它，但摧毁它势在必行
I don't know how to destroy it, but its destruction is imperative.

310
00:26:45,416 --> 00:26:49,837
装置将被激活，当他们听到这些时
The unit will be activated. By the time they hear this,

311
00:26:50,004 --> 00:26:52,674
已经太晚了
it will be too late.

312
00:27:04,394 --> 00:27:09,190
你有非凡的推理能力，你说得很对
You have remarkable reasoning powers. You were quite right.

313
00:27:09,357 --> 00:27:12,819
- 你为什么这么做？  - 你真的想知道吗？
- Why are you doing this? - Do you really want to know?

314
00:27:12,986 --> 00:27:16,573
很快这对你就不重要了，你会很高兴的
Soon it won't matter to you at all. You'll be happy about it.

315
00:27:16,739 --> 00:27:20,493
- 就像康普顿一样  - 我想知道
- Just as Compton was. - I want to know.

316
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:26,541
你太固执了，很明显，我们这样做是因为我们必须这样做
You are so stubborn. It's obvious that we're doing it because we must.

317
00:27:26,708 --> 00:27:33,214
很久以前--在我们的历史中--我们曾经像你们一样
A long time ago -- it is in our history -- we used to be like you.

318
00:27:33,381 --> 00:27:37,552
然后我们的国家几乎被火山爆发摧毁了
Then our country was almost destroyed by volcanic eruptions.

319
00:27:37,719 --> 00:27:41,264
水被污染了，辐射被释放了
The water was polluted. Radiation was released.

320
00:27:41,472 --> 00:27:44,934
那改变了我们，它加速了我们
That changed us. It accelerated us.

321
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:50,356
孩子们死了，大多数女人都不能再有孩子了
Children died. Most of the women could not have any more.

322
00:27:50,523 --> 00:27:53,109
因为所有的男人都变得不育了
All of our men had become sterile.

323
00:27:53,276 --> 00:27:56,904
所以我们不得不与其他人交配
So we had to mate outside our own people.

324
00:27:57,071 --> 00:28:00,283
每当有宇宙飞船驶过时，我们都会请求帮助
Whenever a spaceship came by, we called for help.

325
00:28:00,491 --> 00:28:03,202
但是加速他们耗尽了他们
But accelerating them burned them out.

326
00:28:03,369 --> 00:28:07,790
你明白吗？我需要解释每个细节吗？
Don't you see? Do I have to go into every detail?

327
00:28:10,043 --> 00:28:12,629
我们要带你一起下来
We are going to take you down with us.

328
00:28:12,795 --> 00:28:14,714
也许再带一两个你的船员
Perhaps one or two others of your crew.

329
00:28:15,256 --> 00:28:16,924
我们必须这么做
We have to.

330
00:28:17,091 --> 00:28:21,929
我们会善待你的，我不会伤害你的，我确实喜欢你
We'll be kind to you. I wouldn't hurt you. I do like you.

331
00:28:24,474 --> 00:28:26,100
我的船员呢？
What about my crew?

332
00:28:26,267 --> 00:28:28,227
他们将停留在假死状态
They will stay in suspended animation.

333
00:28:28,394 --> 00:28:31,397
它不会对他们造成任何伤害
It will do them no harm.

334
00:28:31,564 --> 00:28:35,652
我们正在保存他们以备不时之需
We are saving them for when we need them.

335
00:28:35,818 --> 00:28:39,614
你不会永远活下去，你知道的，舰长
You will not last for ever. You know that, Captain.

336
00:28:39,781 --> 00:28:42,450
我们有生存的权利
We have the right to survive.

337
00:28:42,617 --> 00:28:46,621
- 不是通过杀死他人  - 你也会这样做
- Not by killing others. - You would do the same.

338
00:28:46,788 --> 00:28:50,833
当你知道有麻烦时，你就冲入了生命支持系统
You charged into life-support when you knew there was trouble.

339
00:28:51,042 --> 00:28:54,629
- 你会杀了我的人民  - 你入侵了我的船
- You would have killed my people. - You invaded my ship.

340
00:28:54,796 --> 00:28:57,256
- 没有区别！  - 有！
- There is no difference! - There is!

341
00:28:57,423 --> 00:29:01,302
你们的问题…在你们自身
Your trouble... is in you.

342
00:29:01,469 --> 00:29:07,100
不是我们想这样，我们正在以我们知道的唯一方式处理它
We did not ask for it. We are handling it the only way we know how.

343
00:29:07,266 --> 00:29:09,852
我们的父母和他们的父母所做的方式
The way our parents and their parents did.

344
00:29:10,061 --> 00:29:15,024
他们解决了什么问题吗？你们有没有试过其他方式？
Did they solve anything? Have you tried any other way?

345
00:29:15,191 --> 00:29:19,362
迪拉，让你的科学家摧毁那个单位
Deela, have your scientists destroy that unit.

346
00:29:19,529 --> 00:29:23,449
我向你保证，我们将使用我们所拥有的一切技能来帮助你
I promise you, we'll use every skill we have to help you.

347
00:29:23,616 --> 00:29:29,497
我们会把你们带到另一个星球，我们会召集最聪明的人来提供帮助
We'll move you to another planet. We'll call in the most brilliant minds to help.

348
00:29:29,664 --> 00:29:32,458
- 我们会的…  - 我们尝试过其他方法
- We'll do... - We have tried other ways.

349
00:29:32,625 --> 00:29:36,003
我们已经试过转变到你们的级别
We have tried to make the transition to your level.

350
00:29:36,170 --> 00:29:40,508
我们中的一些人，就是这样，那些作出尝试的人都死了
Some of us, that is. Those who made the attempt died.

351
00:29:42,009 --> 00:29:46,180
我们被困住了，舰长，就像你现在被困住了一样
We are trapped, Captain, just as you are trapped now.

352
00:29:47,849 --> 00:29:51,853
我对要发生的事情感到抱歉，但我无法改变它
I'm sorry for what's going to happen, but I cannot change it.

353
00:29:52,019 --> 00:29:54,313
你不能改变我
You cannot change me.

354
00:29:56,899 --> 00:29:59,161
雷尔[通过无线电]：<i>去传送室，迪拉</i>
RAEL [OVER RADIO]: <i>Go to the transporter room, Deela.</i>

355
00:29:59,329 --> 00:30:01,070
<i>给我发信号并传送下去</i>
<i>Signal me and beam down.</i>

356
00:30:01,237 --> 00:30:05,658
- 和舰长？  - <i>是的</i>
- With the captain? - <i>Yes.</i>

357
00:30:05,825 --> 00:30:08,244
<i>我会激活我们的装置并跟上你</i>
<i>I'll activate our unit and follow you.</i>

358
00:30:08,411 --> 00:30:11,914
<i>我给大家留出足够的时间下船</i>
<i>I'm allowing enough time for all of us to get off the ship.</i>

359
00:30:12,123 --> 00:30:16,753
- <i>请不要拖延</i>  - 是什么让你认为我会拖延？
- <i>Please don't delay.</i> - What makes you think I would?

360
00:30:17,837 --> 00:30:21,424
- 舰长逃走了  - 去追他！
- The captain's gone. - Go after him!

361
00:30:23,092 --> 00:30:27,221
毫无疑问，我想让你看看这个
There's no question about it. I want you to take a look at this.

362
00:30:27,388 --> 00:30:30,933
它存在于舰长的咖啡和斯卡罗斯的水中
It's in the captain's coffee and the Scalosian water.

363
00:30:31,142 --> 00:30:33,770
其他杯子里没有任何痕迹
There's no trace in the other cups.

364
00:30:44,655 --> 00:30:46,699
- 你为什么跑？  - 我惊慌失措
- Why did you run? - I panicked.

365
00:30:46,866 --> 00:30:51,454
- 我不相信  - 我想离开
- I don't believe that. - I'd like to leave.

366
00:30:51,630 --> 00:30:53,715
你可以启动了
You can activate.

367
00:30:53,886 --> 00:30:55,972
雷尔[通过无线电]：<i>立刻把他传送下去</i>
RAEL [OVER RADIO]: <i>Beam him down at once.</i>

368
00:31:02,465 --> 00:31:04,717
舰长
Captain.

369
00:31:21,734 --> 00:31:25,780
- 你对传送装置做了什么？  - 它之前可以用
- What did you do to the transporter? - It was working before.

370
00:31:25,947 --> 00:31:28,241
再试一次
Try it again.

371
00:31:31,619 --> 00:31:34,914
- 传送装置不工作  - 他对它做了什么？
- The transporter isn't working. - What did he do to it?

372
00:31:35,081 --> 00:31:37,166
<i>没有什么，他没有那个时间</i>
<i>Nothing. He didn't have time.</i>

373
00:31:37,333 --> 00:31:41,420
一定是…你们怎么说的？故障
It must be a... what do you call it? A malfunction.

374
00:31:42,213 --> 00:31:44,924
你最好不要激活这个装置
You'd better not activate the unit yet.

375
00:31:47,802 --> 00:31:50,429
你有什么看法，舰长？
What would you say it is, Captain?

376
00:31:50,596 --> 00:31:54,350
技术人员报告说断电了，一定是这样
The technicians reported a loss of power. That must be it.

377
00:31:54,517 --> 00:31:59,981
- 舰长说…  - <i>我听到了，我不相信他</i>
- The captain says... - <i>I heard him. I don't believe him.</i>

378
00:32:00,147 --> 00:32:03,526
检查所有可能的原因
Check into all possible causes.

379
00:32:05,611 --> 00:32:08,656
如果我本性多疑，舰长
If I had a suspicious nature, Captain,

380
00:32:08,823 --> 00:32:12,785
我会说你破坏了传送装置以争取时间
I would say that you sabotaged the transporter to buy time.

381
00:32:12,952 --> 00:32:15,663
是的，当然
Yes, of course.

382
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:20,626
我很高兴我们都是无辜的，我鄙视狡猾的人，你呢？
I'm glad we're both innocents. I despise devious people, don't you?

383
00:32:20,793 --> 00:32:24,714
我自己也相信诚实的关系
I believe in honest relationships myself.

384
00:32:24,881 --> 00:32:29,051
护士，确定我们是否可以找到反作用剂
Nurse, determine whether we can find counter agents.

385
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:31,345
[嗡嗡声]
[BUZZING]

386
00:32:32,263 --> 00:32:34,724
医生，你刚才…
Doctor, did you just...

387
00:32:34,891 --> 00:32:39,770
自从我们传送到斯卡罗斯，我就一直听到这种嗡嗡声
I've been hearing that whine ever since we beamed down to Scalos.

388
00:32:41,898 --> 00:32:46,152
我知道它是什么，我们从斯卡罗斯带来了它
I know what it is. We brought it with us from Scalos.

389
00:32:46,319 --> 00:32:49,864
对不起，医生，我应该在舰桥上
Excuse me, Doctor. I shall be on the bridge.

390
00:32:50,031 --> 00:32:55,912
你的宿舍很像你--简朴而高效
Your quarters are quite like you -- austere and efficient,

391
00:32:56,078 --> 00:32:58,164
有自己的格调，英俊
and in their own way, handsome.

392
00:32:58,331 --> 00:33:02,501
一个房间能反映它的居住者
A room should reflect its occupant.

393
00:33:02,668 --> 00:33:06,756
的确，我可以梳洗一下吗？
Absolutely. May I freshen up?

394
00:33:06,923 --> 00:33:10,092
这匆匆忙忙的事情让我的头发都乱了
All this rushing about has left me windblown.

395
00:33:10,259 --> 00:33:14,513
我很高兴看到你让自己舒服点
I'm glad to see you allow yourself some comforts.

396
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:17,183
你结婚了吗，舰长？
Are you married, Captain?

397
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:21,020
没有家庭？没有牵挂？
No family? No attachments?

398
00:33:21,187 --> 00:33:26,609
我知道，你嫁给了你的事业，你从不看其他女人
I know. You're married to your career and you never look at another woman.

399
00:33:26,817 --> 00:33:30,947
嗯，如果她足够漂亮，我会看的
Well, if she's pretty enough, I'll look.

400
00:33:31,113 --> 00:33:35,034
我想知道你什么时候会对我说些好话
I wondered when you'd say something nice to me.

401
00:33:36,702 --> 00:33:39,789
我现在更好看了吗？
Am I more presentable now?

402
00:33:41,958 --> 00:33:43,918
一点点
A bit.

403
00:33:44,835 --> 00:33:50,091
在你看不见我的时候吻你是件很愉快的事
It was quite delightful kissing you when you couldn't see me.

404
00:33:50,257 --> 00:33:54,553
- 但是现在…  - 但是现在…
- But now... - But now...

405
00:34:07,441 --> 00:34:10,236
不，我不会允许你拿走它的
No. I wouldn't allow you to take that,

406
00:34:10,403 --> 00:34:13,155
无论我们多么信任对方
no matter how much we trust each other.

407
00:34:14,991 --> 00:34:19,120
但如果你没有尝试，我会失望的
But I would have been disappointed if you hadn't tried.

408
00:34:19,286 --> 00:34:21,998
我是不是…太粗鲁了？
Was I... too crude?

409
00:34:22,164 --> 00:34:28,421
只是别再试了，你太容易受到皮肤损伤了
Just don't try it again. You're far too vulnerable to skin damage.

410
00:34:28,587 --> 00:34:31,841
我只要…抓一下你
All I have to do is... scratch you.

411
00:34:32,008 --> 00:34:34,677
是的，我知道
Yes, I know.

412
00:34:34,885 --> 00:34:36,929
我们之间的区别在于
The difference between us is that

413
00:34:37,096 --> 00:34:40,182
你会认同我们的思维方式
you will come around to our way of thinking.

414
00:34:41,350 --> 00:34:45,104
但早一点比晚一点好
But it's better sooner than later.

415
00:34:56,032 --> 00:35:00,453
在我的显示器上重播斯卡罗斯人的求救信号
Replay the Scalosian distress call on my viewer.

416
00:35:01,370 --> 00:35:06,459
<i>致所有在斯卡罗斯星球范围内经过的太空旅行者</i>
<i>To any and all space travelers passing within range of the planet Scalos.</i>

417
00:35:06,625 --> 00:35:09,378
<i>我向您发出紧急求助请求</i>
<i>I send you an urgent appeal for help.</i>

418
00:35:09,545 --> 00:35:15,634
<i>我们是曾经繁荣的文明中最后幸存的成员</i>
<i>We are the last surviving members of what was once a thriving civilization.</i>

419
00:35:20,014 --> 00:35:22,224
- <i>康普顿？</i>  - <i>发生了什么？</i>
- <i>Compton?</i> - <i>What happened?</i>

420
00:35:22,433 --> 00:35:28,981
<i>我正看着他，我正看着他，然后他就消失了</i>
<i>I was looking at him. I was looking right at him then he just wasn't there.</i>

421
00:35:31,942 --> 00:35:35,237
 <i>我们在这个地区避难</i>
<i>We have taken shelter in this area.</i>

422
00:35:35,404 --> 00:35:39,033
<i>我们无法解释发生了什么</i>
<i>We have no explanation for what has been happening.</i>

423
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,368
[声音变慢]
[VOICE SLOWS DOWN]

424
00:35:48,209 --> 00:35:51,754
<i>我们在这个地区避难，我们无法解释…</i>
<i>We have taken shelter here. We have no explanation...</i>

425
00:35:51,962 --> 00:35:54,882
<i>我们现在有五个人，我们曾经是一个拥有90万…</i>
<i>We are now five. We were once a nation of 900,000...</i>

426
00:35:56,759 --> 00:35:58,886
[声音加快]
[VOICE SPEEDS UP]

427
00:36:08,062 --> 00:36:10,105
[嗡嗡声]
[BUZZING]

428
00:36:16,111 --> 00:36:18,697
<i>有昆虫</i>
<i>There is insect life.</i>

429
00:36:18,864 --> 00:36:21,784
<i>我的三录仪没显示</i>
<i>My tricorder doesn't register it.</i>

430
00:36:21,951 --> 00:36:25,704
<i>这是一个贫瘠的世界，有限的植被，没有动物</i>
<i>This is a barren world, limited vegetation, no animal life.</i>

431
00:36:46,517 --> 00:36:48,978
- 麦考伊呼叫史波克  - <i>我是史波克</i>
- McCoy to Spock. - <i>Spock here.</i>

432
00:36:49,144 --> 00:36:53,649
我在电脑里找到了一盘磁带，我只能听到嗡嗡声
I found a tape in the computer. All I get is a whine.

433
00:36:53,816 --> 00:36:56,402
<i>马上把它带到舰桥</i>
<i>Bring it to the bridge at once.</i>

434
00:36:58,779 --> 00:37:02,741
<i>连接到生命支持系统的装置</i>

435
00:37:02,908 --> 00:37:06,745
<i>产生一种极度的，麻木的寒冷</i>
<i>produces an extreme, numbing cold.</i>

436
00:37:06,912 --> 00:37:10,291
<i>我认为他们正在把企业号变成</i>
<i>I believe they are turning the Enterprise</i>

437
00:37:10,457 --> 00:37:13,836
<i>一个巨大的深度冷冻的</i>
<i>into a gigantic deep-freeze.</i>

438
00:37:14,003 --> 00:37:19,675
<i>该装置有一个防护罩，不允许任何物理接触</i>
<i>The unit has a protective shield which does not allow any physical contact.</i>

439

<i>我不知道如何摧毁它，但摧毁它势在必行</i>
<i>I don't know how to destroy it, but its destruction is imperative.</i>

440
00:37:27,433 --> 00:37:30,019
迪拉[录音]：<i>装置将被激活</i>
DEELA [ON TAPE]: <i>The unit will be activated.</i>

441
00:37:30,185 --> 00:37:34,189
<i>当他们听到这些时，已经太晚了</i>
<i>By the time they hear this, it will be too late.</i>

442
00:37:34,356 --> 00:37:37,192
乌乎拉，通知其他船员
Uhura, notify the rest of the crew.

443
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:41,488
我们能切开墙壁，绕过力场获取那个装置吗？
Can we cut through the wall, bypass the force field and get at the unit?

444
00:37:41,655 --> 00:37:44,491
我们无法在我们的级别上应付他们
We cannot cope with them on our level.

445
00:37:44,658 --> 00:37:46,660
以他们的级别呢？
What about on theirs?

446
00:37:46,827 --> 00:37:50,873
这是一个合乎逻辑的建议，在传送室待命
That is a logical suggestion. Stand by in the transporter room.

447
00:38:00,466 --> 00:38:05,179
其他地方没有什么问题，有足够的能量传送下去
There's nothing wrong elsewhere. Sufficient energy for beaming down.

448
00:38:05,346 --> 00:38:07,723
这是唯一的损坏？
This is the only damage?

449
00:38:08,724 --> 00:38:11,977
去找其他人，把他们带到这里来
Go get the others and bring them up here.

450
00:38:17,232 --> 00:38:19,151
迪拉
Deela.

451
00:38:21,570 --> 00:38:23,656
迪拉？
Deela?

452
00:38:27,409 --> 00:38:29,161
迪拉？
Deela?

453
00:38:56,021 --> 00:38:57,648
雷尔！
Rael!

454
00:39:11,537 --> 00:39:13,789
雷尔，住手
Rael, stop.

455
00:39:20,796 --> 00:39:22,881
现在
Now.

456
00:39:33,684 --> 00:39:35,811
现在，住手
Now, stop it.

457
00:39:37,438 --> 00:39:39,982
- 他伤害了你吗？  - 没有
- Did he damage you? - No.

458
00:39:40,774 --> 00:39:44,236
你真幸运，雷尔
How very fortunate for you, Rael.

459
00:39:44,403 --> 00:39:49,074
不要再做那样的事了，是可鄙的
Don't do anything like that again. It's contemptible.

460
00:39:49,241 --> 00:39:52,286
那就别折磨我了，你知道我的感受
Then don't torment me. You know how I feel.

461
00:39:52,453 --> 00:39:56,498
我不在乎你的感受，我不想知道那个部分
I don't care about your feelings. I don't want to know that aspect.

462
00:39:56,665 --> 00:39:59,334
你无权质疑我的所作所为
You have no right to question what I do.

463
00:40:02,004 --> 00:40:05,758
让我有尊严地喜欢我选择的男人
Allow me the dignity of liking the man I select.

464
00:40:11,638 --> 00:40:17,019
- 传送装置修好了吗？  - 不，我还有更多工作要做
- Is the transporter repaired? - No. I have more work to do.

465
00:40:17,936 --> 00:40:20,981
你不认为你最好去修吗？
Don't you think you'd better do it?

466
00:40:47,382 --> 00:40:51,887
他爱我，我小时候很崇拜他
He loves me. I adored him when I was a child.

467
00:40:52,054 --> 00:40:54,640
我想我仍然爱他
I suppose I still do.

468
00:40:54,807 --> 00:40:57,476
你表现得比他好
You behaved better than he did.

469
00:40:57,643 --> 00:41:00,395
- 但愿如此  - 你说什么？
- I hope so. - What did you say?

470
00:41:00,562 --> 00:41:03,232
我说但愿我表现得不错
I said I hoped I behaved correctly.

471
00:41:05,651 --> 00:41:08,821
现在没有什么困扰你了吗？
And nothing bothers you now?

472
00:41:12,908 --> 00:41:18,497
- 我们为什么在这里？  - 我们的离开被推迟了，记得吗？
- Why are we here? - Our leaving was delayed, remember?

473
00:41:18,664 --> 00:41:23,919
- 你破坏了传送zhu装置ang zhi  - 哦，是的，那是我错了
- You damaged the transport. - Oh, yes. That was wrong of me.

474
00:41:25,212 --> 00:41:27,840
是的，确实如此
Yes, it certainly was.

475
00:41:28,006 --> 00:41:32,094
- 但我们要去斯卡罗斯？  - 你想要去吗？
- But we are going to Scalos? - Do you want to?

476
00:41:32,261 --> 00:41:35,430
- 哦，是的  - 你不担心你的船员吗？
- Oh, yes. - Aren't you worried about your crew?

477
00:41:35,597 --> 00:41:38,767
- 他们会没事的  - 哦
- They'll be all right. - Oh.

478
00:41:38,934 --> 00:41:42,771
- 怎么了？  - 没有什么
- What's the matter? - Nothing.

479
00:41:44,356 --> 00:41:49,111
你已经完全接受了，不是吗？你甚至喜欢它
You've completely accepted the situation, haven't you? You even like it.

480
00:41:49,278 --> 00:41:52,447
- 我表现得不对吗？  - 不
- Am I behaving incorrectly? - No.

481
00:41:53,907 --> 00:41:58,704
我更喜欢以前的你，固执，易怒，有主见，像雷尔
I liked you better before. Stubborn, irritating and independent. Like Rael.

482
00:41:58,871 --> 00:42:02,416
这些都是不受欢迎的品质
Those are undesirable qualities.

483
00:42:02,583 --> 00:42:06,628
也许这就是我喜欢你的原因，因为你和他一样
Maybe that's why I liked you. Because you were like him.

484
00:42:09,089 --> 00:42:13,093
雷尔，你不必担心舰长
Rael, you don't have to worry about the captain.

485
00:42:14,219 --> 00:42:16,972
他适应了
He's made the adjustment.

486
00:42:18,432 --> 00:42:20,475
完成的
Finished.

487
00:42:29,443 --> 00:42:32,613
它最有效地抵消了物质
It counteracts the substance most effectively.

488
00:42:32,779 --> 00:42:37,826
在实验室条件下，但它会在人体中起作用吗？
Under laboratory conditions. But will it work in the human body?

489
00:42:37,993 --> 00:42:42,956
- 我们怎么把它交给舰长？  - 通过喝下斯卡罗斯的水
- And how do we get it to the captain? - By drinking the Scalosian water.

490
00:42:43,123 --> 00:42:46,126
但你不知道这会对你有什么影响
But you don't know what that will do to you.

491
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:50,964
有点刺激
It is somewhat stimulating.

492
00:42:54,635 --> 00:42:58,472
医生，你似乎走得很慢
You seem to be moving very slowly, Doctor.

493
00:42:58,639 --> 00:43:00,682
[嗡嗡声]
[BUZZING]

494
00:43:06,271 --> 00:43:08,649
真有趣
Fascinating.

495
00:43:13,779 --> 00:43:15,906
他消失了
He's gone.

496
00:43:17,866 --> 00:43:20,369
就像康普顿一样
Just like Compton.

497
00:43:34,466 --> 00:43:37,177
我传送其他人下去了
I've beamed the others down.

498
00:43:37,281 --> 00:43:39,062
迪拉[通过无线电]：<i>已经修好了吗？</i>
DEELA [OVER RADIO]: <i>Is it repaired already?</i>

499
00:43:39,454 --> 00:43:41,046
你为什么不告诉我？
Why didn't you tell me?

500
00:43:42,057 --> 00:43:44,559
这本来是一种入侵
It would have been an intrusion.

501
00:43:44,726 --> 00:43:47,354
当你准备好时给我发信号
Signal me when you are ready.

502
00:43:47,521 --> 00:43:50,232
- 你会在哪里？  - <i>生命支持系统</i>
- Where will you be? - <i>In life-support.</i>

503
00:43:50,399 --> 00:43:53,151
- <i>我必须激活我们的装置</i>  - <i>等等</i>
- <i>I have to activate our unit.</i> - <i>Wait.</i>

504
00:43:53,318 --> 00:43:56,405
抱歉
I'm sorry.

505
00:43:56,571 --> 00:43:58,824
我知道
I know.

506
00:44:04,579 --> 00:44:07,833
来吧，舰长，是时候离开你漂亮的船了
Come, Captain. It's time to leave your pretty ship.

507
00:44:14,756 --> 00:44:19,094
装置已启动，迪拉，立刻传送下来
The unit is activated, Deela. Beam down at once.

508
00:44:19,261 --> 00:44:22,514
你的船员会没事的，你自己也是这么说的
You crew will be all right. You said so yourself.

509
00:44:27,769 --> 00:44:30,272
抱歉
I'm sorry.

510
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:34,985
- 他离开了，带着武器  - 我准备好了
- He's broken away. He's armed. - I'm ready for him.

511
00:45:15,025 --> 00:45:18,945
你很聪明，舰长，你耍了我
You are very clever, Captain. You tricked me.

512
00:45:19,112 --> 00:45:22,532
我早该知道你永远不会适应
I should have known that you would never adjust.

513
00:45:23,825 --> 00:45:25,911
我们现在应该期待什么？
What shall we expect now?

514
00:45:26,078 --> 00:45:30,082
我们现在可以让你处于假死状态
We could put you in suspended animation for now.

515
00:45:31,083 --> 00:45:33,668
你的存留并不取决于此
Your survival does not depend on that.

516
00:45:33,835 --> 00:45:38,465
不，它不是，你想让我们对你做什么？
No, it doesn't. What do you want us to do with you?

517
00:45:38,632 --> 00:45:42,177
不要把它当作游戏，舰长，我们输了
Don't make a game of it, Captain. We've lost.

518
00:45:42,344 --> 00:45:45,764
如果我把你们送回斯卡罗斯，你们还会玩同样的把戏
If I sent you back to Scalos, you'd play the same trick

519
00:45:45,931 --> 00:45:47,682
对下一艘经过的飞船
on the next passing ship.

520
00:45:47,849 --> 00:45:50,685
不会有其他人了，你会警告他们
There won't be any others. You'll warn them.

521
00:45:50,852 --> 00:45:53,271
你的联邦会隔离整个区域
You will quarantine the entire area.

522
00:45:53,438 --> 00:45:55,649
是的，我想会的
Yes, we will.

523
00:45:55,816 --> 00:46:01,196
我们会死，并以这种方式解决你的问题，还有我们的
And we will die and solve your problem that way. And ours.

524
00:46:07,035 --> 00:46:11,206
你的问题呢，舰长，还有你的瓦肯朋友？
What about your problem, Captain, and your Vulcan friend?

525
00:46:11,373 --> 00:46:15,794
如果你投身于斯卡罗斯的事务
If you will devote yourself exclusively to the concerns of Scalos

526
00:46:15,961 --> 00:46:19,047
我们很乐意留下并照顾<i>企业号</i>
we shall be pleased to take care of the <i>Enterprise</i>.

527
00:46:19,214 --> 00:46:23,552
你仍然可以发现斯卡罗斯的生活非常愉快
You could still find life on Scalos very pleasant.

528
00:46:23,718 --> 00:46:27,222
- 并且非常短暂  - 和这里一样短暂
- And very brief. - It will be just as brief here.

529
00:46:27,389 --> 00:46:30,392
你无法回到你自己的级别
You cannot get back to your own level.

530
00:46:36,314 --> 00:46:39,192
没有答案吗，舰长？
No answer, Captain?

531
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:43,321
- 我让你这么不高兴吗？  - 哦，不是
- Do I displease you so much? - Oh, no.

532
00:46:44,322 --> 00:46:50,370
我想没有什么比和你在一起更愉快的了
I can think of nothing I'd rather do than stay with you.

533
00:46:50,537 --> 00:46:52,622
除了活着
Except staying alive.

534
00:47:03,341 --> 00:47:05,385
启动
Energize.

535
00:47:05,552 --> 00:47:08,138
再见，舰长
Goodbye, Captain.

536
00:47:17,898 --> 00:47:19,941
你有什么消息？
What have you got?

537
00:47:20,108 --> 00:47:25,530
我们已经合成了一种可能对抗斯卡罗斯的水的反作用剂
We have synthesised a possible counter agent to the Scalosian water.

538
00:47:25,697 --> 00:47:29,284
但是我们没有机会测试它
But we did not have the opportunity to test it.

539
00:47:29,451 --> 00:47:32,412
让我们测试一下
Let's test it.

540
00:47:45,050 --> 00:47:47,636
什么都没有发生
Nothing's happening.

541
00:47:53,183 --> 00:47:55,810
你的动作似乎非常缓慢
You do seem to be moving very slowly.

542
00:47:55,977 --> 00:48:00,982
[慢声]先生…
[SLOW VOICE] Mister...

543
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:06,821
史波克
Spock.

544
00:48:06,988 --> 00:48:09,574
舰长！你从哪儿来的？
Captain! Where did you come from?

545
00:48:09,741 --> 00:48:14,120
- 不知道从哪儿冒出来的  - 史波克先生也来了吗？
- Out of the nowhere into the here. - Is Mr. Spock coming too?

546
00:48:14,287 --> 00:48:16,164
斯科提
Scotty.

547

柯克：<i>舰长日志，星历5710.9</i>
KIRK: <i>Captain's log, stardate 5710.9.</i>

548
00:48:19,751 --> 00:48:22,420
<i>史波克先生一直处于加速状态</i>
<i>Mr. Spock has remained in accelerated time</i>

549
00:48:22,587 --> 00:48:25,090
<i>这样他能更快地进行修复</i>
<i>so he might effect repairs more rapidly.</i>

550
00:48:25,257 --> 00:48:30,345
- 有人正在修理每个控制台！  - 电路恢复的速度如此之快！
- Somebody's repairing every console! - They're being recircuited so fast!

551
00:48:30,512 --> 00:48:34,683
我想我们已经找到了史波克先生
I think we've located Mr. Spock.

552
00:48:34,849 --> 00:48:38,019
- 你的电路通畅了吗？  - 是的，长官
- Are your circuits clearing? - Yes, sir.

553
00:48:38,186 --> 00:48:41,523
取消红色警报，打开所有频道
Cancel Red Alert. Open all channels.

554
00:48:44,234 --> 00:48:47,862
舰长呼叫船员，修理工作由史波克先生负责
Captain to crew. Repairs are being effected by Mr. Spock.

555
00:48:48,029 --> 00:48:52,117
该船即将恢复正常运行
The ship will resume normal operations almost immediately.
