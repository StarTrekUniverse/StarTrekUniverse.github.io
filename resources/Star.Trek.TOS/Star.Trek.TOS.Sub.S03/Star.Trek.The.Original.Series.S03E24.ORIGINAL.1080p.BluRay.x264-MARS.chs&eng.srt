[柯克]舰长日志，星历5928.5
[KIRK] Captain's log, stardate 5928.5.

2
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:12,801
企业号收到了来自加缪二上一群科学家的求救信号
The Enterprise has received a distress call from a group of scientists on Camus II,

3
00:00:12,839 --> 00:00:15,651
他们正在探索一个死亡文明的废墟
who are exploring the ruins of a dead civilization.

4
00:00:16,035 --> 00:00:17,635
他们的处境很绝望
Their situation is desperate.

5
00:00:18,473 --> 00:00:21,455
其中两名幸存者是探险队外科医生科尔曼
Two of the survivors are the expedition surgeon, Doctor Coleman,

6
00:00:21,883 --> 00:00:24,955
和探险队队长珍妮丝·莱斯特博士
and the leader of the expedition, Dr. Janice Lester.

7
00:00:25,955 --> 00:00:26,617
她怎么了？
What's wrong with her?

8
00:00:27,061 --> 00:00:28,366
暴露于辐射
Exposure to radiation.

9
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:30,591
那是什么形式的辐射？
What form of radiation was it?

10
00:00:30,917 --> 00:00:32,517
我从来没有遇到过的
Nothing I've ever encountered.

11
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:48,718
珍妮丝你必须保持绝对平静
Janice, you must remain absolutely quiet.

12
00:00:49,965 --> 00:00:51,548
那是医生的命令，不是我的
Those are doctor's orders, not mine.

13
00:00:54,535 --> 00:00:57,951
舰长，三录仪采集到微弱的生命读数
Captain. Tricorder picking up very faint life readings.

14
00:00:58,071 --> 00:01:00,989
距离这里大约700米
Approximately seven hundred metres from here.

15
00:01:01,107 --> 00:01:02,323
必须立即提供帮助
Help will have to be immediate.

16
00:01:03,748 --> 00:01:05,481
[呻吟]
[GROANS]

17
00:01:06,963 --> 00:01:08,681
也许你在场能让她平静下来
Perhaps your presence will quiet her.

18
00:01:19,569 --> 00:01:21,361
我希望过我不再见到你
I hoped I wouldn't see you again.

19
00:01:22,362 --> 00:01:23,294
我不怪你
I don't blame you.

20
00:01:24,086 --> 00:01:29,526
我们一起在星际舰队的那一年是我生命中唯一鲜活的时光
The year we were together at Starfleet is the only time in my life I was alive.

21
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:32,213
我从来没有阻止过你继续你的太空工作
I never stopped you from going on with your space work.

22
00:01:32,897 --> 00:01:36,902
你的星舰舰长的世界不接受女性
Your world of starship captains doesn't admit women.

23
00:01:38,666 --> 00:01:40,358
这不公平
It isn't fair.

24
00:01:40,629 --> 00:01:41,480
是不公平
No, it isn't.

25
00:01:42,847 --> 00:01:45,855
你因此惩罚和折磨我
And you punished and tortured me because of it.

26
00:01:50,389 --> 00:01:51,696
我爱过你
I loved you.

27
00:01:53,767 --> 00:01:56,470
我们本可以在群星之间漫游
We could have roamed among the stars.

28
00:01:57,205 --> 00:01:58,229
我们会互相残杀
We'd have killed each other.

29
00:02:01,477 --> 00:02:02,501
那可能更好了
It might have been better.

30
00:03:14,578 --> 00:03:16,818
[柯克]宇宙，最后的边疆
[KIRK] Space, the final frontier.

31
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:26,596
这些是星舰企业号的航程
These are the voyages of the starship Enterprise.

32
00:03:27,727 --> 00:03:31,311
它的五年任务：探索未知的新世界
Its five-year mission: To explore strange new worlds,

33
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:34,819
寻找新生命和新文明
to seek out new life and new civilizations,

34
00:03:35,893 --> 00:03:38,645
勇踏前人未至之境
to boldly go where no man has gone before.

35
00:03:39,493 --> 00:03:42,768
星际旅行：原初
第三季第二十四集

36
00:04:38,893 --> 00:04:40,324
你有过机会，柯克舰长
You had your chance, Captain Kirk.

37
00:04:40,471 --> 00:04:42,108
你应该杀了我
You should've smothered the life in me.

38
00:04:42,645 --> 00:04:44,684
然后人们会说：“珍妮丝·莱斯特博士
Then they would have said, "Dr. Janice Lester

39
00:04:45,323 --> 00:04:47,530
在执行任务时死于辐射中毒”
died of radiation poisoning in the line of duty."

40
00:04:48,045 --> 00:04:51,309
你为什么不做？你一直想，不是吗？
Why didn't you do it? You always wanted to, didn't you?

41
00:04:54,525 --> 00:04:56,381
你有力气去做
You had the strength to do it.

42
00:04:59,443 --> 00:05:00,467
但是你害怕
But you were afraid.

43
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:02,034
你总是害怕
You were always afraid.

44
00:05:02,712 --> 00:05:06,616
现在珍妮丝·莱斯特取代了柯克舰长的位置
Now Janice Lester takes the place of Captain Kirk.

45
00:05:10,021 --> 00:05:11,685
我已经拥有了你的力气
I already possess your physical strength.

46
00:05:15,183 --> 00:05:19,855
只是这个柯克舰长不怕杀人
Only this Captain Kirk is not afraid to kill.

47
00:05:20,378 --> 00:05:20,992
[呻吟]
[MOANS]

48
00:05:21,592 --> 00:05:25,382
现在你知道身为一个女人的羞辱感了
Now you know the indignity of being a woman.

49
00:05:28,701 --> 00:05:32,093
对你来说，这种痛苦很快就会过去，就像对我一样
For you this agony will soon pass, as it has for me.

50
00:05:32,377 --> 00:05:34,809
安静！安静！
Quiet! Quiet!

51
00:05:35,348 --> 00:05:41,296
相信我，死总比独自活在女人的身体里好
Believe me, it is better to be dead than to live alone in the body of a woman.

52
00:05:42,668 --> 00:05:43,454
死了更好
It's better to be dead.

53
00:05:46,854 --> 00:05:48,480
[脚步声]
[FOOTSTEPS]

54
00:06:00,247 --> 00:06:02,999
麦考伊医生，你的报告
Doctor McCoy. Your report.

55
00:06:04,102 --> 00:06:06,086
我们太晚了，吉姆，什么也做不了
We were too late, Jim. There's nothing could be done.

56
00:06:06,721 --> 00:06:09,795
是所说的辐射吗？
Was it radiation as suggested?

57
00:06:10,554 --> 00:06:11,962
不，我认为是鏼
No, I believe it was celebium.

58
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:13,992
但是，科尔曼医生不同意
However, Doctor Coleman disagrees.

59
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:16,101
具体一点很重要
To be specific is essential

60
00:06:16,958 --> 00:06:18,080
因为鏼的治疗相当…
because the treatment of celebium is quite ...

61
00:06:18,145 --> 00:06:18,849
麦考伊医生
Doctor McCoy.

62
00:06:23,085 --> 00:06:25,517
我们不在的时候你有没有注意到任何不寻常的症状？
Did you notice any unusual symptoms while we were gone?

63
00:06:26,154 --> 00:06:28,122
不，完全没有，她一直都昏迷不醒
No, nothing at all. She was unconscious all of the time.

64
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:36,305
莱斯特博士快死了
Dr. Lester is near death.

65
00:06:37,627 --> 00:06:41,851
也许发生在她员工身上的事给她造成的打击也是一部分原因
Perhaps the shock of knowing what happened to her staff is part of her problem.

66
00:06:43,645 --> 00:06:44,723
我肯定是的
I'm sure it is.

67
00:06:45,092 --> 00:06:47,716
把她传送到企业号要比等待安全
Beaming her up to the Enterprise will be less harmful than waiting.

68
00:06:48,054 --> 00:06:50,325
我不知道，我不确定
I don't know. I'm not sure.

69
00:07:00,649 --> 00:07:02,276
柯克舰长呼叫企业号
Captain Kirk to the Enterprise.

70
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:03,870
柯克舰长呼叫企业号
Captain Kirk to the Enterprise.

71
00:07:04,602 --> 00:07:05,415
我是斯科特，长官
Mr. Scott, sir.

72
00:07:05,844 --> 00:07:06,804
斯科特先生
Mr. Scott.

73
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,959
准备将登陆小队传送上船
Prepare to beam the landing party aboard

74
00:07:10,366 --> 00:07:12,106
还有另外两人，其中一个病危
plus two others. One critically ill.

75
00:07:12,139 --> 00:07:14,584
让医疗团队随时待命接收患者
Have a medical team standing by to receive the patient.

76
00:07:15,219 --> 00:07:16,755
通话完毕
Captain Kirk, out.

77
00:07:20,413 --> 00:07:21,373
准备传送上船
Prepare to beam aboard.

78
00:07:32,927 --> 00:07:35,693
科尔曼医生，陪病人去医务室
Docotr Coleman, accompany the patient to the Sickbay.

79
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:40,253
史波克先生，让飞船脱离轨道
Mr. Spock, take the ship out of orbit.

80
00:07:40,746 --> 00:07:42,858
恢复指定航线
Resume designated course.

81
00:07:43,679 --> 00:07:44,303
麦考伊医生
Doctor McCoy.

82
00:07:45,404 --> 00:07:50,719
麦考伊医生你和科尔曼医生似乎对诊断意见不一
Docotr McCoy, you and Docotr Coleman seem to disagree on diagnosis.

83
00:07:51,368 --> 00:07:53,949
不，不完全相左，我们都同意这是辐射
No, not entirely. We both agree it's radiation.

84
00:07:54,036 --> 00:07:56,909
科尔曼医生不准备说什么形式的辐射
Docotr Coleman isn't prepared to say what form of radiation.

85
00:07:57,121 --> 00:07:59,067
会影响你完成正确的治疗吗？
Will it affect your arriving at a correct treatment?

86
00:08:00,499 --> 00:08:01,267
这很关键
It's crucial.

87
00:08:03,297 --> 00:08:06,369
嗯，这对我来说尤其令人不安
Well, this is especially disturbing to me

88
00:08:07,119 --> 00:08:10,112
因为…个人原因
for ... personal reasons.

89
00:08:10,552 --> 00:08:12,344
哦？我不知道你和她那么熟
Oh? I didn't know you knew her that well.

90
00:08:13,013 --> 00:08:14,629
哦，是的，我已经很久没有见到她了
Oh, yes. It's been a long time since I saw her.

91
00:08:16,684 --> 00:08:18,326
当关系变得认真起来时，我离开了她
I walked out on her when it became serious.

92
00:08:19,325 --> 00:08:22,013
嗯，那时你一定很年轻，吉姆
Well, you must have been very young at the time, Jim.

93
00:08:23,809 --> 00:08:26,151
年轻不是每件事的借口，麦考伊医生
Youth doesn't excuse everything, Doctor McCoy.

94
00:08:28,146 --> 00:08:29,490
对我来说是非常不愉快的记忆
It's a very unhappy memory for me.

95
00:08:30,738 --> 00:08:31,986
我没有意识到这一点
I didn't realize that.

96
00:08:32,208 --> 00:08:33,936
我会尽我所能
I shall do everything in my power.

97
00:08:34,219 --> 00:08:35,949
谢谢，非常感谢
Thank you. Thank you very much.

98
00:08:39,728 --> 00:08:44,147
莱斯特博士…能逃脱真是一个非常幸运的年轻人
Dr. Lester ... is certainly a very lucky young person to have escaped.

99
00:08:44,885 --> 00:08:47,509
是的，很幸运，非常幸运
Yes, very lucky. Very lucky.

100
00:08:53,104 --> 00:08:54,747
[呻吟]
[GROANS]

101
00:09:08,536 --> 00:09:09,300
刚刚开始
It just began.

102
00:09:09,441 --> 00:09:10,531
那你最好停下来
Well you'd better put a stop to it!

103
00:09:11,106 --> 00:09:13,920
如果你让莱斯特博士完全恢复意识
If you allow Dr. Lester to become fully conscious,

104
00:09:14,088 --> 00:09:14,909
她就会知道发生了什么
she'll know what has happened.

105
00:09:15,292 --> 00:09:17,092
可能没有人会相信
Probably no one will believe it.

106
00:09:17,504 --> 00:09:18,269
可能？
Probably?

107
00:09:18,784 --> 00:09:20,000
这就是我们能要求的一切
That's all we can ask for.

108
00:09:21,517 --> 00:09:23,843
现在如何解释死亡？
How can death be explained now?

109
00:09:26,114 --> 00:09:27,221
我告诉你不能继续了
I tell you it can't continue.

110
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:30,271
你杀死了每一个工作人员
You killed every one of the staff.

111
00:09:30,669 --> 00:09:33,635
你把他们派到了你明知鏼护盾薄弱的地方
You sent them where you knew the celebium shielding was weak.

112
00:09:34,296 --> 00:09:36,920
现在你为什么不杀了他？你有过绝佳的机会
Now why didn't you kill him? You had the perfect opportunity.

113
00:09:38,223 --> 00:09:39,247
时间不够
There wasn't enough time.

114
00:09:40,434 --> 00:09:42,895
我给足了你要的时间
I gave you every minute you asked for.

115
00:09:44,653 --> 00:09:47,021
他太执着于生活，我不能…
He hung onto life too hard. I couldn't ...

116
00:09:47,131 --> 00:09:48,551
你不能，因为你爱他
You couldn't because you love him.

117
00:09:49,343 --> 00:09:51,192
你想让我成为杀他的凶手
You want me to be his murderer.

118
00:09:51,994 --> 00:09:53,979
爱？他？
Love？Him?

119
00:09:54,733 --> 00:09:55,898
我爱他拥有的生活
I love the life he led.

120
00:09:56,365 --> 00:09:58,605
星舰指挥官的权力
The power of a starship commander.

121
00:09:59,995 --> 00:10:00,717
现在是我的生活了
It's my life now.

122
00:10:02,161 --> 00:10:03,652
我不会成为杀人犯
I won't become a murderer.

123
00:10:04,362 --> 00:10:05,155
你就是凶手！
You are a murderer!

124
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:11,964
你知道是鏼，你本可以治疗他们
You knew it was celebium. You could've treated them for it.

125
00:10:12,609 --> 00:10:14,081
你杀了好多次人了
You're a murderer many times over.

126
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,149
吉姆，你在这里做什么？
Jim, what are you doing here?

127
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:23,220
我以为我在场可以让莱斯特医生平静下来
I thought my presence might quiet Dr. Lester.

128
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:24,227
它似乎产生了相反的效果
It seems to have had the opposite effect.

129
00:10:24,647 --> 00:10:25,927
跟你没关系
It's nothing to do with you.

130
00:10:26,745 --> 00:10:29,049
这是发展中的放射病的症状
It's a symptom of the developing radiation illness.

131
00:10:29,228 --> 00:10:33,836
船上设备的测试表明没有内部辐射损伤的迹象，科尔曼医生
Tests with the ship's equipment shows no signs of internal radiation damage, Doctor Coleman.

132
00:10:34,428 --> 00:10:38,140
莱斯特博士的工作人员在昏迷和临死前不是变得神志不清了吗？
Didn't Dr. Lester's staff become delirious before they went off and died?

133
00:10:39,725 --> 00:10:41,000
是的，舰长，是的
Yes, Captain. Yes.

134
00:10:41,417 --> 00:10:44,773
莱斯特博士可能是被相位枪击晕的
Dr. Lester could be suffering from a phaser stun

135
00:10:44,773 --> 00:10:46,857
根据我对症状的观察，吉姆
as far as the symptoms I can detect, Jim.

136
00:10:48,043 --> 00:10:52,213
科尔曼医生，麦考伊医生在企业号上
Docotr Coleman, Docotr McCoy has had a great deal of experience

137
00:10:52,256 --> 00:10:54,365
有过大量的辐射暴露经验
with radiation exposure on board the Enterprise.

138
00:10:55,884 --> 00:10:57,163
我以他的意见为指导
I am guided by his opinion.

139
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:02,140
莱斯特博士和她的工作人员在我的监督下已经两年了
Dr. Lester and her staff have been under my supervision for two years now.

140
00:11:03,241 --> 00:11:05,225
如果你不听我的建议
If you don't follow my recommendations,

141
00:11:05,589 --> 00:11:10,517
她的健康或死亡将是你的责任
responsibility for her health or her death will be yours.

142
00:11:17,187 --> 00:11:19,299
麦考伊医生，抱歉
Doctor McCoy, I'm sorry,

143
00:11:20,066 --> 00:11:22,846
我要把你从病例中移出，把它交给科尔曼医生
but I'm going to have to take you off the case and turn it over to Doctor Coleman.

144
00:11:23,336 --> 00:11:24,360
你不能这样做！
You can't do this!

145
00:11:24,686 --> 00:11:26,734
在这艘船上，我的医疗权是最大的
On this ship my medical authority is final!

146
00:11:28,048 --> 00:11:30,864
科尔曼医生想承担全部责任，让他来吧
Doctor Coleman wants to assume the full responsibility. Let him do it.

147
00:11:31,176 --> 00:11:32,006
我不允许的
I won't allow it.

148
00:11:32,038 --> 00:11:32,868
就这么定了！
It's done!

149
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:37,388
科尔曼医生，你的病人
Docotr Coleman, your patient.

150
00:11:41,467 --> 00:11:44,091
科尔曼医生，你不应该用镇静剂让病人休息吗？
Doctor Coleman, didn't you suggest a sedation to rest the patient?

151
00:11:44,352 --> 00:11:45,179
是的，舰长
Yes, Captain.

152
00:11:45,309 --> 00:11:47,659
没有必要，吉姆，你没看到她正在苏醒吗？
It's not necessary, Jim. Can't you see she's coming around?

153
00:11:57,783 --> 00:11:58,615
科尔曼医生
Docotr Coleman.

154
00:11:59,024 --> 00:12:00,983
护士，注射镇静剂
Nurse, administer the sedative.

155
00:12:02,457 --> 00:12:04,953
现在用镇静剂并不明智，舰长
A sedative is not wise at this time, Captain.

156
00:12:05,075 --> 00:12:06,931
查佩尔护士，这是命令
Nurse Chapel, you have your orders.

157
00:12:08,248 --> 00:12:12,116
查佩尔护士，按照说明操作
Nurse Chapel, follow your instructions.

158
00:12:25,517 --> 00:12:31,533
哦，不，我真的在失去弃企业号的指挥权吗？
Oh no. Am I really losing command of the Enterprise?

159
00:12:32,235 --> 00:12:37,995
不，哦，不，噩梦，噩梦
No. Oh, no. Bad dream. Bad dream.

160
00:12:54,845 --> 00:12:58,337
[柯克]詹姆斯·柯克正在珍妮丝·莱斯特的身体中恢复知觉
[KIRK] James Kirk is returning to consciousness in the body of Janice Lester.

161
00:12:58,896 --> 00:13:01,455
企业号正在前往下一个任务
The Enterprise is proceeding to its next mission,

162
00:13:01,531 --> 00:13:03,899
按照我接过指挥前设定的航线
on the course set before I took over command.

163
00:13:04,285 --> 00:13:09,469
现在，我花在研究飞船运作的每一个细节上的多年时间将得到检验
Now the years I spent studying every single detail of the ship's operation will be tested.

164
00:13:10,269 --> 00:13:14,193
有了一点经验，我就不会被怀疑了
With a little experience, I will be invulnerable to suspicion.

165
00:13:25,236 --> 00:13:27,188
我终于得到我该得的了
At last I attain what is my just due.

166
00:13:27,747 --> 00:13:28,963
星舰的指挥权
Command of a starship.

167
00:13:29,693 --> 00:13:32,765
几个月的准备工作现在终于取得了成果
All the months of preparation now come to fruition.

168
00:13:41,725 --> 00:13:42,749
航线，契科夫先生
Course, Mr. Chekov.

169
00:13:43,218 --> 00:13:44,925
127，标记8
127, mark 8.

170
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:49,804
苏鲁先生，将速度设置为曲速2级
Mr. Sulu, set speed at warp factor 2.

171
00:13:50,335 --> 00:13:51,539
曲速2级，长官
Warp factor 2, sir.

172
00:14:14,155 --> 00:14:17,035
契科夫先生，绘制一条去贝尼西亚殖民地的航线
Mr. Chekov, plot a course for the Benecia Colony.

173
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:20,672
直达贝尼西亚的航线，373，标记8
Direct course to Benecia, 373, mark 8.

174
00:14:20,976 --> 00:14:23,152
以我们现在的速度到殖民地还要多久？
How long to the colony at our present speed?

175
00:14:23,622 --> 00:14:24,710
48小时，长官
48 hours, sir.

176
00:14:25,753 --> 00:14:27,895
苏鲁先生，设定到殖民地的航线
Mr. Sulu, set course for the colony.

177
00:14:28,347 --> 00:14:29,684
373，标记8
373, mark 8.

178
00:14:29,814 --> 00:14:33,333
是，长官，373标记8
Aye, sir. 373 mark 8.

179
00:14:33,816 --> 00:14:36,440
舰长，这将耽搁我们在御夫座β的工作
Captain, that will delay our work at Beta Aurigae.

180
00:14:36,456 --> 00:14:37,622
意味着要逆转航线
It means reversing course.

181
00:14:37,741 --> 00:14:38,706
是的，没办法
Yes, it can't be helped.

182
00:14:38,755 --> 00:14:41,076
我们必须把莱斯特医生带到可以接受治疗的地方
We must take Dr. Lester to a place where she can be treated.

183
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:45,172
我可以指出星际基地2在直达我们目的地的航线上吗？
May I point out that Starbase 2 is on the direct route to our destination?

184
00:14:47,593 --> 00:14:48,617
到星际基地2还要多久？
How long to Starbase 2?

185
00:14:49,702 --> 00:14:50,857
72小时，舰长
72 hours, Captain.

186
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:52,891
多24小时太久了
That's 24 hours too long.

187
00:14:53,064 --> 00:14:55,736
莱斯特博士的病情越来越严重
Dr. Lester's condition is increasingly serious.

188
00:14:56,225 --> 00:14:57,201
继续当前的航线
Continue present course.

189
00:14:57,434 --> 00:14:57,980
是，长官
Aye, sir.

190
00:15:00,021 --> 00:15:03,781
长官，如果诊断莱斯特医生的病是关键问题
Sir, if the diagnosis of Dr. Lester's illness is the critical problem,

191
00:15:04,326 --> 00:15:07,052
那么贝尼西亚殖民地绝对不适合她
then the Benecia Colony is definitely not the place for her.

192
00:15:07,219 --> 00:15:09,574
他们的医疗设施非常简陋
Their medical facilities are the most primitive.

193
00:15:09,888 --> 00:15:10,702
他们必须得提供服务
They will have to serve.

194
00:15:10,979 --> 00:15:13,262
星际基地2设施非常完善
Starbase 2 is fully equipped

195
00:15:13,517 --> 00:15:15,602
而且配备必要的专家
and staffed with the necessary specialists

196
00:15:15,816 --> 00:15:18,696
能确定博士到底出了什么问题
to determine exactly what is wrong with the doctor.

197
00:15:19,822 --> 00:15:21,934
这对你的决定不重要吗？
Is that not crucial to your decision?

198
00:15:22,365 --> 00:15:23,278
谢谢，史波克先生
Thank you, Mr. Spock.

199
00:15:23,846 --> 00:15:27,141
但如果莱斯特博士死了，这些设施毫无用处
But the facilities will be of little use if Dr. Lester's dead.

200
00:15:28,899 --> 00:15:30,873
时间就是生命，继续当前航线
Time is of the essence. Continue present course.

201
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:40,910
以最大速度，星际基地2仍然可以应付紧急情况
At maximum speed, Starbase 2 would still meet the emergency.

202
00:15:47,101 --> 00:15:50,365
舰长，我要通知星际舰队指挥部计划改变吗？
Captain, shall I advise Starfleet Command of the change of plan?

203
00:15:51,575 --> 00:15:53,874
没有下令改变计划，上尉
No change of plan has been ordered, Lieutenant.

204
00:15:54,654 --> 00:15:56,946
只是我们要稍微迟一点到达御夫座β
Our arrival at Beta Aurigae will merely be delayed.

205
00:15:57,127 --> 00:16:00,147
我们对该双星系统的引力研究不会受到影响
Our gravitational studies of that binary system will not suffer,

206
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:01,683
而且也许能挽救一个人的生命!
and a life may be saved!

207
00:16:01,909 --> 00:16:04,067
这对企业号来说并不是不寻常的程序
That is not unusual procedure for the Enterprise.

208
00:16:04,398 --> 00:16:08,530
长官，我认为必须通知星际舰队
Sir, I believe Starfleet will have to be notified

209
00:16:08,649 --> 00:16:12,745
我们与星舰波将金号的会合不会如期进行
that our rendezvous with the starship Potemkin will not take place as scheduled.

210
00:16:16,744 --> 00:16:20,136
史波克先生，如果你专注于你负责的领域
Mr. Spock, if you'd concentrate on the areas for which you are responsible,

211
00:16:20,366 --> 00:16:22,286
星际舰队司令部早就知道了
Starfleet Command would've been informed already.

212
00:16:23,712 --> 00:16:28,064
由于这些事务通常由舰长直接与星际舰队处理
Since the captain usually deals directly with Starfleet in these matters,

213
00:16:28,781 --> 00:16:32,237
我认为我的建议可能会被视为干涉
I assumed that my suggestions might be deemed interference.

214
00:16:35,478 --> 00:16:37,348
将延迟告知星际舰队，上尉
Inform Starfleet of the delay, Lieutenant.

215
00:16:37,636 --> 00:16:38,236
是，长官
Aye, sir.

216
00:16:38,547 --> 00:16:39,635
继续当前航线
Continue present course.

217
00:16:40,943 --> 00:16:42,991
将速度提高到曲速6级
Increase speed to warp factor 6.

218
00:16:47,135 --> 00:16:49,055
我的记录可以为我作证
I'll let my record speak for me.

219
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:51,934
你为什么这么生气？
Why are you being so defensive?

220
00:16:51,961 --> 00:16:54,797
我把你从病例中移出，并不表示批评你
There's no implied criticism of you in my order to remove you from the case.

221
00:16:55,073 --> 00:16:56,525
这不是我在这里的原因
That is not the reason I'm here.

222
00:16:56,597 --> 00:17:00,306
我在这里是因为科尔曼医生的记录表明他无能
I'm here because Doctor Coleman's record states that he's incompetent.

223
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:02,946
那是你个人的看法
That's the opinion of an individual.

224
00:17:03,055 --> 00:17:05,852
不，那是星舰指挥部的看法
No, sir. That is the opinion of Starfleet Command.

225
00:17:05,907 --> 00:17:06,880
我向他们核实了
I checked with them.

226
00:17:07,268 --> 00:17:09,865
科尔曼医生因管理无能
Docotr Coleman was removed from his post

227
00:17:10,103 --> 00:17:13,449
而被解除其船上首席医疗官的职务
as Chief Medical Officer of his ship for administrative incompetence.

228
00:17:13,715 --> 00:17:15,894
这里不需要管理职责
There are no administrative duties required here.

229
00:17:16,214 --> 00:17:18,454
也不需要公然的医疗事故
As well as flagrant medical blunders.

230
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:22,698
晋升和降职可能是政治操纵，你知道的，老骨头
Promotions and demotions can be politically maneuvered. You know that, Bones.

231
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:25,284
在星际舰队总部不可能，舰长！
Not in Starfleet Headquarters, Captain!

232
00:17:26,234 --> 00:17:29,050
当然在军医署也不可能
And certainly not in the Surgeon General's office.

233
00:17:32,117 --> 00:17:33,589
恐怕命令就是如此
I'm afraid the order will have to stand.

234
00:17:36,732 --> 00:17:42,067
我只能说科尔曼医生的经历和星球上发生的事
I can only say that Doctor Coleman's experience with what happened on the planet

235
00:17:42,121 --> 00:17:43,873
必须是这里的决定因素
had to be the deciding factor here.

236
00:17:43,997 --> 00:17:46,396
我相信你能意识到这一点
I'm sure that you can appreciate that.

237
00:17:47,207 --> 00:17:49,881
我意识到了你要做出决定的事实
I appreciate the fact that you had a decision to make.

238
00:17:50,433 --> 00:17:52,993
我现在也要做个决定，吉姆
I also find myself in that position now, Jim,

239
00:17:53,681 --> 00:17:56,327
我要你来报到做个检查
and I'm asking you to report for an examination.

240
00:17:56,734 --> 00:17:59,651
为什么？你的依据是什么？
Why? What do you base that on?

241
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:04,872
出现了情绪不稳定和不稳定的心理态度
Development of emotional instability and erratic mental attitudes

242
00:18:04,959 --> 00:18:06,728
自从从那个星球回来后
since returning from that planet.

243
00:18:11,103 --> 00:18:12,599
你的指控永远不会成立
You'll never make that charge stick.

244
00:18:12,838 --> 00:18:14,135
任何傻瓜都能看出你为什么要这样做
Any fool can see why you're doing this.

245
00:18:15,824 --> 00:18:18,976
我会让星际舰队指挥部来判断我的动机
I'll let Starfleet Command be the judge of my motives.

246
00:18:19,339 --> 00:18:22,539
我不会服从这种小小的报复行为
I won't submit to this petty search for revenge!

247
00:18:23,107 --> 00:18:25,795
但你要服从星际舰队的规定
But you will submit to Starfleet regulations,

248
00:18:26,637 --> 00:18:30,413
他们说船上的外科医生需要全面检查
and they state that the ship's surgeon will require full examination

249
00:18:30,449 --> 00:18:35,015
任何他怀疑的船员，包括舰长
of any crew member that he has doubts about, including the captain.

250
00:18:37,107 --> 00:18:38,471
[通讯器发出哔哔声]
[COMMUNICATOR BLEEPS]

251
00:18:44,405 --> 00:18:45,365
我是柯克舰长
Captain Kirk here.

252
00:18:45,978 --> 00:18:46,802
我是苏鲁，舰长
Sulu here, Captain.

253
00:18:47,491 --> 00:18:50,563
星际舰队指挥部要求提供延误的更多详细信息
Starfleet Command is requesting additional details on the delay.

254
00:18:51,401 --> 00:18:52,051
我马上到
I'll be right there.

255
00:19:19,047 --> 00:19:20,593
脉搏压…
Pulse pressure ...

256
00:19:22,485 --> 00:19:25,365
…血量，身体机能正常，那我为什么在这里？
 ...blood count, all body functions normal, then why am I here?

257
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:28,518
麦考伊医生？
Doctor McCoy?

258
00:19:30,461 --> 00:19:31,549
麦考伊医生…
Doctor McCoy ...

259
00:19:33,264 --> 00:19:34,672
你最好安静一点
Quiet would be best for you.

260
00:19:35,124 --> 00:19:36,144
麦考伊医生呢？
Where's Doctor McCoy?

261
00:19:36,555 --> 00:19:37,579
现在是我负责
I'm in charge now.

262
00:19:37,868 --> 00:19:39,700
马上带麦考伊医生来！
Bring Doctor McCoy at once!

263
00:19:39,744 --> 00:19:42,048
他在这艘船上掌管医疗
He is in command of medicine on this ship.

264
00:19:42,937 --> 00:19:45,945
他被柯克舰长从你的病例中移出了
He was taken off your case by Captain Kirk.

265
00:19:46,429 --> 00:19:47,999
被柯克舰长？
By Captain Kirk?

266
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:51,634
这样做是为了保护你自己，莱斯特博士
It was done for your own protection, Dr. Lester.

267
00:19:52,225 --> 00:19:55,294
我不是珍妮丝·莱斯特！她把我变成了这样！
I am not Janice Lester! She did this to me!

268
00:19:55,294 --> 00:19:57,133
现在我怎样才能让你明白？
Now how can I make you understand?

269
00:19:57,198 --> 00:20:00,874
珍妮丝的嫉妒、仇恨和野心把她自己逼疯了
Janice has driven herself mad with jealousy, hatred and ambition.

270
00:20:01,942 --> 00:20:05,971
查佩尔护士，马上让史波克先生和麦考伊医生来我这儿
Nurse Chapel, bring Mr. Spock and Doctor McCoy to me at once.

271
00:20:06,025 --> 00:20:08,345
现在他们必须相信我不是珍妮丝·莱斯特
Now they must believe I am not Janice Lester.

272
00:20:08,405 --> 00:20:12,412
我被囚禁在她的身体里，但我不是珍妮丝·莱斯特
I am imprisoned in her body, but I am not Janice Lester.

273
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:15,326
她正遭受成为柯克舰长的错觉
She is suffering from the delusion of being Captain Kirk.

274
00:20:16,473 --> 00:20:18,622
我不是珍妮丝莱斯特！
I am not Janice Lester!

275
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:22,078
这种偏执过去六个月一直在发展
The paranoia has been developing for the past six months.

276
00:20:22,812 --> 00:20:24,888
辐射似乎加剧了它
The radiation seems to have intensified it.

277
00:20:25,279 --> 00:20:26,868
她必须保持镇静
She must be kept sedated.

278
00:20:27,225 --> 00:20:28,836
我要准备一种温和的镇静剂吗，医生？
Shall prepare a mild sedative, Doctor?

279
00:20:29,031 --> 00:20:29,714
当然
Of course.

280
00:20:42,212 --> 00:20:44,077
你疯了，莱斯特博士
You are insane, Dr. Lester.

281
00:21:08,645 --> 00:21:12,039
[柯克]舰长日志，星历未知
[KIRK] Captain's log, stardate unknown.

282
00:21:12,533 --> 00:21:14,389
我忘记了时间
I have lost track of time.

283
00:21:14,539 --> 00:21:17,283
我仍然被囚禁在一个陌生的身体里
I am still held captive in a strange body

284
00:21:17,283 --> 00:21:19,275
并与我所有的船员分开
and separated from all my crew.

285
00:21:20,243 --> 00:21:22,611
在你听来我之前一定很疯狂
I must have sounded quite mad to you before.

286
00:21:23,046 --> 00:21:25,606
你的经历会让我们大多数人都崩溃
What you've been through would break most of us.

287
00:21:25,779 --> 00:21:26,931
我现在已经好了
Well, I'll be all right now.

288
00:21:27,883 --> 00:21:29,580
我能见见你的麦考伊医生吗？
Could I see your Doctor McCoy?

289
00:21:30,491 --> 00:21:33,179
恐怕这违反了科尔曼医生的命令
I'm afraid that's against Doctor Coleman's orders.

290
00:21:36,564 --> 00:21:40,212
哦，允许那个非常善良的史波克先生来访吗？
Oh. Is a visit by that very kind Mr. Spock to be allowed?

291
00:21:41,129 --> 00:21:43,753
也许在我们到达贝尼西亚殖民地之前能安排
Perhaps that can be arranged before we reach the Benecia Colony.

292
00:21:44,133 --> 00:21:45,293
贝尼西亚殖民地？
The Benecia Colony?

293
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:48,286
企业号不是要在御夫座β与波将金号会合吗？
But isn't the Enterprise going to rendezvous with the Potemkin at Beta Aurigae?

294
00:21:49,149 --> 00:21:51,588
嗯，首先我们得让你在贝尼西亚疗养
Well, first we have to let you recuperate at Benecia.

295
00:21:54,728 --> 00:21:55,944
喝一点，你会舒服一些
You'll feel better if you have a little.

296
00:21:58,485 --> 00:22:00,093
嗯，我会试试的，谢谢
Well, I'll try. Thank you.

297
00:22:03,426 --> 00:22:04,943
哦，很好喝，谢谢
Oh, it is good. Thank you.

298
00:22:11,076 --> 00:22:12,887
我可以慢慢喝完吗，查佩尔护士？
Could I finish it slowly, Nurse Chapel?

299
00:22:13,521 --> 00:22:14,036
呃…
Well ...

300
00:22:14,112 --> 00:22:15,316
我保证我会乖乖的
I promise I'll be good.

301
00:22:18,737 --> 00:22:19,889
好，我马上就回来
Well, I'll be right back.

302
00:22:21,535 --> 00:22:23,183
我很高兴你感觉好多了
I'm glad you're feeling so much better.

303
00:22:37,319 --> 00:22:40,391
这些测试应该能帮助我查明吉姆生病的原因
These tests should help me pinpoint the cause of Jim's illness.

304
00:22:40,897 --> 00:22:44,929
很好，舰长行为异常的消息正在船上传播
Good. Knowledge of the captain's aberrant behaviour is spreading through the ship.

305
00:22:45,009 --> 00:22:46,977
船员越来越紧张
The crew is becoming increasingly tense.

306
00:22:48,261 --> 00:22:49,996
没错，我最担心的
Yes, well what worries me most

307
00:22:50,104 --> 00:22:53,516
是吉姆似乎完全没有意识到他有问题
is that Jim seems completely unaware something is wrong with him.

308
00:22:54,632 --> 00:22:57,641
我们必须让他意识到已经发生了严重的事情
We've got to make him realize that something serious is happening

309
00:22:57,652 --> 00:22:59,368
在开始治疗之前
before treatment can even begin.

310
00:23:00,097 --> 00:23:02,465
我恐怕希望渺茫，医生
I'm afraid that is a forlorn hope, Doctor.

311
00:23:02,792 --> 00:23:05,224
这种疾病似乎主要是精神上的
The illness appears to be primarily mental.

312
00:23:05,568 --> 00:23:07,574
我们中的一个人应该能说服他，我…
Well, one of us should be able to get to him. I ...

313
00:23:08,502 --> 00:23:10,491
我不知道，我一直在寻找一种方法
I don't know. I keep looking for an approach,

314
00:23:10,491 --> 00:23:14,267
但疾病扩散的速度使其变得加倍困难
but the speed at which the illness has traveled makes it doubly difficult.

315
00:23:15,041 --> 00:23:17,089
也许应该提醒军医署
Perhaps the Surgeon General's office should be alerted.

316
00:23:17,708 --> 00:23:18,995
你了解总部的，史波克
You know headquarters, Spock.

317
00:23:19,015 --> 00:23:21,433
他们只对特定测试的结果感兴趣
They're only interested in results of specific tests.

318
00:23:21,509 --> 00:23:23,813
目前为止我们只能提供意见
So far all we have to offer are our opinions.

319
00:23:24,529 --> 00:23:28,661
你确定以舰长现在的精神状态他会服从你的命令吗？
Are you sure that the captain will comply with your order in his present state of mind?

320
00:23:29,079 --> 00:23:31,831
如有必要我会使用我的医疗权力强制执行
I'll use my medical authority to enforce it if necessary.

321
00:23:37,423 --> 00:23:40,940
医生，我们必须如履薄冰
Doctor, we are treading on very thin ground.

322
00:23:41,181 --> 00:23:44,527
诸如此类的行为可能会被误解
Actions such as these might be misinterpreted.

323
00:23:44,917 --> 00:23:46,391
那么就是吧
Well, then, so be it.

324
00:23:47,541 --> 00:23:49,077
我们的责任很明确
Our responsibility is clear.

325
00:23:50,024 --> 00:23:51,597
不管在那个星球上舰长发生了什么
Whatever happened to the captain on that planet

326
00:23:51,629 --> 00:23:55,373
一定是在他和莱斯特博士单独相处的短时间内发生的
must've taken place in the short space of time that he was alone with Dr. Lester.

327
00:23:56,059 --> 00:23:58,846
与她的谈话可能会有所启发
Perhaps a conversation with her might shed some light.

328
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:00,246
嗯，这值得一试
Well, it's worth a try.

329
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:03,318
要不我检查吉姆时，你试着去找莱斯特医生
Why don't you try to get to Dr. Lester while I examine Jim.

330
00:24:05,879 --> 00:24:09,207
好，先生们，我来了，医生
Well, gentlemen. I'm here, Doctor.

331
00:24:14,999 --> 00:24:16,669
史波克，老骨头，帮帮我
Spock, Bones, help me. 

332
00:24:16,745 --> 00:24:18,003
别让他们把我关起来和你们分开
Don't let them lock me away from you.

333
00:24:18,019 --> 00:24:18,963
我得和你们谈谈
I've got to talk to you.

334
00:24:24,902 --> 00:24:25,734
吉姆！
Jim!

335
00:24:28,490 --> 00:24:29,364
她可能杀了人
She might have killed someone.

336
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:32,176
把她隔离在她房间
Put her in isolation in her room.

337
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:33,466
24小时看守
Maintain a 24-hour watch.

338
00:24:33,892 --> 00:24:36,839
任何人，禁止任何人未经我允许就和她说话
No one, absolutely no one, is to talk to her without my permission！

339
00:24:36,853 --> 00:24:37,384
是，长官
Yes, sir.

340
00:24:49,857 --> 00:24:50,625
舰长
Captain

341
00:25:01,195 --> 00:25:02,065
博士怎么样？
How is the doctor?

342
00:25:02,734 --> 00:25:04,241
她很快恢复了知觉
She regained consciousness very quickly.

343
00:25:04,376 --> 00:25:06,040
很好，我有几个问题要问她
Good. I have questions to ask her.

344
00:25:06,443 --> 00:25:07,448
是舰长命令的吗，长官？
Did the captain order it, sir?

345
00:25:08,099 --> 00:25:08,803
为什么他要命令？
Why should he?

346
00:25:09,170 --> 00:25:11,858
我有问题要问，因此是我在下命令，上尉
They are my questions, therefore I am ordering it, Lieutenant.

347
00:25:12,407 --> 00:25:14,736
舰长说禁止任何人和莱斯特博士说话
The captain said no one is allowed to speak to Dr. Lester.

348
00:25:14,905 --> 00:25:17,253
以前这种命令包括他的高级军官吗？
Has such an order ever included his senior officers?

349
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,240
没有，长官
No, sir.

350
00:25:20,649 --> 00:25:24,517
史波克先生，我想舰长的意思是应该有一个警卫在场
Mr. Spock, I think the captain meant that a guard should be present.

351
00:25:24,695 --> 00:25:25,847
当然可以，上尉
By all means, Lieutenant.

352
00:25:33,881 --> 00:25:35,673
够了，够了
That's enough. That's enough.

353
00:25:36,342 --> 00:25:38,077
你的心脏还能跳很久，舰长
Your heart will last forever, Captain.

354
00:25:40,191 --> 00:25:41,015
其他部分怎么样？
How am I otherwise?

355
00:25:41,539 --> 00:25:42,871
像往常一样非常健康
In the pink as usual.

356
00:25:44,102 --> 00:25:48,134
肝、肾、血细胞计数、代谢率、
Liver, kidney, blood count, metabolic rate,

357
00:25:48,793 --> 00:25:50,300
所有功能，甚至你的腺体
everything, even your glands,

358
00:25:50,356 --> 00:25:53,307
都以通常的正常效率峰值运行
functioning at their usual, normal peak of efficiency.

359
00:25:53,323 --> 00:25:56,104
好的，我希望你和我一样满意
Good. I hope you're as pleased about it as I am.

360
00:25:59,589 --> 00:26:00,549
慢点穿上
Don't get dressed yet.

361
00:26:02,461 --> 00:26:03,997
你说我身体很好
You said I was in perfect condition.

362
00:26:06,334 --> 00:26:06,974
身体上
Physically.

363
00:26:10,591 --> 00:26:12,303
我认为没必要进行另一个测试
I don't think another test is necessary.

364
00:26:12,677 --> 00:26:14,740
罗比阿尼皮肤视觉是至关重要的
The Robbiani dermal-optic is crucial.

365
00:26:15,549 --> 00:26:17,836
它显示了基本的情绪结构
It reveals the basic emotional structure.

366
00:26:19,029 --> 00:26:20,181
你以前测过一次
You had one once before.

367
00:26:20,905 --> 00:26:23,342
现在我需要再测一次来与之前的测试进行比较
Now I need another one to compare with that previous test.

368
00:26:24,179 --> 00:26:27,357
你对颜色波长的皮肤视觉反应
There should be no change in your dermal-optic reactions

369
00:26:27,448 --> 00:26:28,856
应该没有变化
to the color wavelengths.

370
00:26:34,175 --> 00:26:34,943
过来，舰长
Over here, Captain.

371
00:26:41,794 --> 00:26:42,626
过来，舰长
Over here, Captain.

372
00:26:43,244 --> 00:26:49,438
借助机械装置完成生命实体转移？
Complete life-entity transfer with the aid of a mechanical device?

373
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:52,268
是的，一定是这样的
Yes, that's what it must've been.

374
00:26:53,203 --> 00:26:57,427
据我所知，这样的完全转移从未完全成功地完成过
To my knowledge, such total transfer has never been accomplished with complete success

375
00:26:58,011 --> 00:26:59,472
在银河系的任何地方
anywhere in the galaxy.

376
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:02,296
很久以前在加缪二上完成并被遗忘了
It was accomplished and forgotten long ago on Camus II.

377
00:27:02,315 --> 00:27:03,640
我就是一个活生生的例子
I'm a living example.

378
00:27:04,176 --> 00:27:05,112
那是你的一面之辞
That is your claim.

379
00:27:05,842 --> 00:27:11,256
迄今为止，没有得到任何…外部证据的证实
As yet it is unsubstantiated by any ... external evidence,

380
00:27:11,721 --> 00:27:13,385
或客观测试
or objective tests.

381
00:27:14,551 --> 00:27:17,138
然而我说的是实话，史波克
Nevertheless, Spock, it is the truth I'm speaking.

382
00:27:22,119 --> 00:27:24,167
现在放下你的手臂，睁开你的眼睛
Now lower your arms and open your eyes.

383
00:27:28,163 --> 00:27:32,003
此刻，麦考伊医生正在检查
At this moment, Doctor McCoy is examining

384
00:27:33,074 --> 00:27:35,366
舰长的精神变化
the captain for psychological changes.

385
00:27:35,623 --> 00:27:37,148
如果发现任何事实
If any facts are uncovered,

386
00:27:37,976 --> 00:27:40,095
那将是可以接受的证据
that would be acceptable evidence.

387
00:27:40,366 --> 00:27:43,201
星际舰队指挥部和企业号的船员
The only kind which is acceptable to Starfleet Command

388
00:27:43,893 --> 00:27:45,441
唯一可以接受的证据
and to the crew of the Enterprise.

389
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:52,224
史波克，当我被困在索利安星区的间隙中时
Spock, when I was caught in the interspace of the Tholian Sector,

390
00:27:52,238 --> 00:27:55,250
你冒着你和企业号的安危让我回来
you risked your life and the Enterprise to get me back.

391
00:27:56,527 --> 00:27:57,814
现在帮我回去
Help me get back now.

392
00:27:59,788 --> 00:28:03,080
当米纳拉的维恩人要求我们让老骨头死的时候
When the Vians of Minara demanded that we let Bones die,

393
00:28:03,132 --> 00:28:04,168
我们没有允许
we didn't permit it.

394
00:28:05,087 --> 00:28:07,582
没错，舰长没有
That is true. The captain did not.

395
00:28:08,132 --> 00:28:10,564
但是，那些事件已被记录下来
However, those events have been recorded.

396
00:28:11,374 --> 00:28:12,515
这些事可能为你所知
They could have become known to you.

397
00:28:19,050 --> 00:28:21,930
你和舰长的关系比宇宙中任何人都亲近
You are closer to the captain than anyone in the universe.

398
00:28:22,904 --> 00:28:24,120
你知道他的想法
You know his thoughts.

399
00:28:28,044 --> 00:28:30,604
你的心灵感应现在告诉你什么？
What does your telepathic mind tell you now?

400
00:29:03,608 --> 00:29:04,305
我相信你
I believe you.

401
00:29:05,839 --> 00:29:10,086
然而，我相信并不是可以接受的证据
However, my belief is not acceptable evidence.

402
00:29:10,778 --> 00:29:12,186
证据必须是真实的
Evidence must be factual.

403
00:29:13,655 --> 00:29:15,319
麦考伊医生也许能上帮忙
Doctor McCoy may be of help.

404
00:29:16,609 --> 00:29:17,367
跟我来
Come with me.

405
00:29:19,521 --> 00:29:21,410
对不起，长官，但莱斯特博士不能离开这里
I'm sorry, sir, but Dr. Lester cannot leave here.

406
00:29:27,659 --> 00:29:30,283
那你对测试结果满意吗？
Well, are you satisfied with the results of the tests?

407
00:29:30,798 --> 00:29:33,076
没有明确证据表明任何疾病
There is no positive evidence of any disorder.

408
00:29:33,441 --> 00:29:35,169
你在让我违反舰长的命令
You're asking me to violate the captain's orders.

409
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,577
他不是舰长
He is not the captain.

410
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:38,433
你和她一样疯
You're as mad as she is.

411
00:29:39,278 --> 00:29:41,569
你要立刻离开这里，我服从命令
You're to leave here at once. I follow orders.

412
00:29:42,721 --> 00:29:45,729
当然，上尉，我们都必须尽自己的职责
Certainly, Lieutenant. We all must do our duty.

413
00:29:48,002 --> 00:29:48,962
警卫！
Security guard!

414
00:29:50,017 --> 00:29:51,087
没有难受的感觉，老骨头
No hard feelings, Bones.

415
00:29:51,524 --> 00:29:53,194
你的活儿一如既往细致优秀
You did your usual thorough, good job.

416
00:29:54,663 --> 00:29:56,300
我相信一切都会好起来的
I'm sure everything's going to be all right.

417
00:29:57,661 --> 00:29:58,901
[哔哔]
[BLEEPING]

418
00:29:59,158 --> 00:29:59,888
男人[通过对讲机]柯克舰长？
MAN [OVER INTERCOM] Captain Kirk?

419
00:30:01,567 --> 00:30:02,254
我是柯克舰长
Captain Kirk here.

420
00:30:02,867 --> 00:30:04,110
莱斯特博士试图逃脱
Escape attempt by Dr. Lester.

421
00:30:05,936 --> 00:30:07,054
柯克舰长呼叫警卫
Captain Kirk to security.

422
00:30:07,082 --> 00:30:08,624
立刻去莱斯特博士房间
On the double to Dr. Lester's room.

423
00:30:13,574 --> 00:30:15,430
没问题，少尉，一切都在控制之中
It's quite all right, Ensign. Everything is under control.

424
00:30:23,032 --> 00:30:23,672
相位枪
Phasers.

425
00:30:25,109 --> 00:30:29,682
不要有有任何肢体暴力行为…长官
A repetition of your physical violence is not called for ... sir.

426
00:30:30,759 --> 00:30:33,641
我不会有身体上的反抗
No physical resistance will be offered.

427
00:30:44,464 --> 00:30:45,774
注意，所有人员
Attention, all personnel.

428
00:30:47,842 --> 00:30:49,645
大副史波克已被逮捕
First Officer Spock has been placed under arrest.

429
00:30:50,063 --> 00:30:54,543
他与莱斯特博士密谋从你们的舰长手中接管这艘船
He has conspired with Dr. Lester to take over the ship from your captain.

430
00:30:55,213 --> 00:31:00,303
将立即召开听证会审议
A hearing will be immediately convened to consider the charges and specifications

431
00:31:00,981 --> 00:31:05,672
军事法庭对…叛变的指控和量刑
of a general court martial on the charge ... of mutiny.

432
00:31:14,667 --> 00:31:17,227
[珍妮丝]舰长日志，星历5930.3
[JANICE] Captain's log, stardate 5930.3.

433
00:31:18,119 --> 00:31:22,539
麦考伊医生的检查结果给了我十足的信心
The results of Doctor McCoy's examination have given me complete confidence in myself.

434
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:24,359
我的恐惧已经消失
My fears are past.

435
00:31:24,616 --> 00:31:26,664
我将作为舰长自由发挥舰长职能
I shall function freely as the captain.

436
00:31:26,866 --> 00:31:29,426
事实上，我就是企业号的舰长
I am captain of the Enterprise, in fact.

437
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:32,668
当然，你必须有更多的东西才能继续
Surely you must have more than that to go on.

438
00:31:32,961 --> 00:31:34,243
我已经陈述了我的证据
I have stated my evidence.

439
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:38,403
与詹姆斯·T·柯克舰长的心灵感应交流
Telepathic communication with the mind of Captain James T. Kirk.

440
00:31:39,196 --> 00:31:41,692
你的证据是完全主观的
Your evidence is completely subjective.

441
00:31:42,681 --> 00:31:46,649
我们必须有可以公开查验的证据
We have to have evidence that we can examine out in the open.

442
00:31:47,344 --> 00:31:48,902
你已经有了大量的证据
You've had great deal of evidence,

443
00:31:49,197 --> 00:31:50,712
除了主要证人的
except that of the chief witness.

444
00:31:50,763 --> 00:31:53,715
本应是这次调查的真正对象的人
The one who should be the real subject of this investigation

445
00:31:53,971 --> 00:31:56,339
被锁起来，并处于隔离状态
is kept locked away and in isolation.

446
00:31:57,467 --> 00:31:59,963
为什么，舰长？
Why, Captain?

447
00:32:01,555 --> 00:32:04,581
她是个危险的疯子，我们已经看到了证据
She's dangerously insane. We've seen the evidence.

448
00:32:05,474 --> 00:32:08,546
她只对你的权力构成危险，长官
She is dangerous only to your authority, sir.

449
00:32:10,816 --> 00:32:11,712
史波克先生
Mr. Spock.

450
00:32:15,454 --> 00:32:18,720
史波克先生，我的权力是星际舰队指挥部授予我的
Mr. Spock, my authority has been given to me by Starfleet Command,

451
00:32:19,250 --> 00:32:22,044
只有最高权力机构才能把它拿走
and only that high authority can take it away.

452
00:32:22,604 --> 00:32:25,228
证人，长官，带证人上来
The witness, sir. Bring on the witness.

453
00:32:25,681 --> 00:32:27,468
让你的军官提出问题
Let your officers put the questions.

454
00:32:35,986 --> 00:32:39,265
莱姆里先生，带珍妮丝·莱斯特博士带来这里
Mr. Lemli, have Dr. Janice Lester brought here.

455
00:32:39,485 --> 00:32:40,133
是，长官
Aye, sir.

456
00:32:51,282 --> 00:32:52,100
麦考伊医生
Doctor McCoy,

457
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:56,219
当史波克先生忙于他雄心勃勃的阴谋时，你在做什么？
while Mr. Spock was busy with his ambitious plot, what were you doing?

458
00:32:57,549 --> 00:32:58,509
检查你
Examining you.

459
00:32:59,346 --> 00:33:01,937
哦，是的，你深切地关心我的
Oh, yes. You were deeply concerned about my

460
00:33:01,965 --> 00:33:04,851
健康，情绪和身体，自从离开加缪二之后
health, emotional and physical, since leaving Camus Two.

461
00:33:04,851 --> 00:33:05,253
对吗？
Is that correct?

462
00:33:06,619 --> 00:33:07,515
是的，没错
Yes, that's correct.

463
00:33:07,882 --> 00:33:12,106
你没有试图杀死我，而是在寻找帮助我的方法
Instead of trying to destroy me, you were searching for ways to help me.

464
00:33:13,734 --> 00:33:15,389
麦考伊医生，为了记录在案
Doctor McCoy, for the record,

465
00:33:15,441 --> 00:33:16,806
你会告诉法庭你的检查结果吗？
will you tell the court your findings?

466
00:33:19,099 --> 00:33:21,409
舰长处于最佳的身体状态
The captain is in the best of physical condition.

467
00:33:21,597 --> 00:33:23,355
他的情绪和精神状态
His emotional and mental state

468
00:33:23,355 --> 00:33:26,845
与他担任企业号指挥的时候相当
is comparable to the time that he assumed command of the Enterprise.

469
00:33:27,682 --> 00:33:29,511
谢谢，麦考伊医生
Thank you, Doctor McCoy.

470
00:33:29,904 --> 00:33:33,995
史波克先生，你知道麦考伊医生的检查结果吗？
Mr. Spock, were you aware of Doctor McCoy's findings?

471
00:33:35,035 --> 00:33:35,995
我现在知道了
I know them now.

472
00:33:36,602 --> 00:33:38,427
那你现在有什么要说的？
And what have you to say now?

473
00:33:38,917 --> 00:33:41,207
我很失望和深深地担心
I am disappointed and deeply concerned

474
00:33:41,237 --> 00:33:43,829
没有客观证据支持我的立场
that there is no objective evidence to support my position.

475
00:33:44,825 --> 00:33:45,559
到目前为止
So far.

476
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:56,092
科尔曼医生，如果这里需要你，我们会传唤你
Docotr Coleman, if you're required here, we'll call you.

477
00:34:06,407 --> 00:34:07,879
无疑我们感谢你的到来
We certainly appreciate your being here.

478
00:34:08,222 --> 00:34:11,358
每个人都深深地意识到你受到了
Everyone is deeply aware that you have been subjected to

479
00:34:11,712 --> 00:34:13,376
过度的情绪压力
inordinate emotional stress.

480
00:34:13,676 --> 00:34:15,949
我们希望避免任何进一步的压力
We had hoped to avoid any further stress,

481
00:34:15,949 --> 00:34:18,637
但史波克先生不同意
but Mr. Spock disagrees.

482
00:34:19,078 --> 00:34:21,956
他认为你的证词很重要
It is his opinion that your testimony is important

483
00:34:21,969 --> 00:34:24,145
在确定他的论据的真假时
in determining the merits of his case.

484
00:34:24,766 --> 00:34:27,783
由于我们只对做出公正的决定感兴趣
And since we are solely interested in arriving at a just decision,

485
00:34:29,379 --> 00:34:31,555
我将不得不再问你几个问题
I'm going to have to ask you a few more questions.

486
00:34:33,181 --> 00:34:34,269
我会尽量不惹恼你
I'll try not to upset you.

487
00:34:40,567 --> 00:34:42,635
你声称…
You claim that ...

488
00:34:45,689 --> 00:34:47,351
你是詹姆斯·T·柯克舰长？
that you are Captain James T. Kirk?

489
00:34:47,690 --> 00:34:50,390
不，我不是柯克舰长
No. I am not Captain Kirk.

490
00:34:51,316 --> 00:34:52,682
这是非常明显的
That is very apparent.

491
00:34:53,225 --> 00:34:58,729
我声称使詹姆斯·柯克成为一个对他自己来说很特殊的生命体的东西
I claim that whatever it is that makes James Kirk a living being special to himself

492
00:34:59,347 --> 00:35:01,267
被关在这里在这具身体里
is being held here in this body.

493
00:35:01,714 --> 00:35:05,120
哦，那根据我的理解
Oh. Well. However, as I understand it,

494
00:35:06,425 --> 00:35:09,128
我是珍妮丝·莱斯特博士
I am Dr. Janice Lester.

495
00:35:09,671 --> 00:35:11,881
[全体笑]
[ALL LAUGH]

496
00:35:14,395 --> 00:35:17,211
很聪明，但我没这么说
That's very clever, but I didn't say it.

497
00:35:18,268 --> 00:35:23,367
我说的是，詹妮丝·莱斯特博士正在使用詹姆斯·柯克的身体
I said, the body of James Kirk is being used by Dr. Janice Lester.

498
00:35:25,130 --> 00:35:26,243
不知为何我忽略了微妙的不同
A subtlety that somehow escapes me.

499
00:35:27,806 --> 00:35:33,213
我假设这个转换是通过双方协议达成的
I assume that this switch was arrived at by mutual agreement.

500
00:35:33,484 --> 00:35:37,292
不，是莱斯特博士的暴力袭击造成的
No. It was brought about by a violent attack by Dr. Lester

501
00:35:37,329 --> 00:35:39,852
并使用她在加缪二上发现的设备
and the use of equipment she discovered on Camus II.

502
00:35:40,784 --> 00:35:46,536
这位女士对柯克舰长施暴？
Violence by the lady, perpetrated on Captain Kirk?

503
00:35:48,419 --> 00:35:52,110
我请参会人员看看珍妮丝·莱斯特博士
I ask the assembled personnel to look at Dr. Janice Lester

504
00:35:52,283 --> 00:35:54,478
并想象那个历史性的时刻
and visualize that historic moment.

505
00:35:56,989 --> 00:36:00,576
你能，你能告诉我珍妮丝·莱斯特博士为什么
Can you, can you tell me why Dr. Janice Lester

506
00:36:00,590 --> 00:36:03,854
会同意这种荒唐的交换吗？
would agree to this ludicrous exchange?

507
00:36:04,548 --> 00:36:07,684
能，为了获得她渴望的力量
Yes. To get the power she craved.

508
00:36:08,533 --> 00:36:12,885
为了获得一个以她的秉性和训练不应该得到的职位
To attain a position she doesn't merit by temperament or training.

509
00:36:13,739 --> 00:36:17,067
而且，最重要的是，她想谋杀詹姆斯·柯克
And, most of all, she wanted to murder James Kirk,

510
00:36:17,794 --> 00:36:19,431
一个曾经爱过她的男人
a man who once loved her.

511
00:36:20,432 --> 00:36:25,808
但她对自己的女性身份的强烈憎恨使她无法继续生活
But her intense hatred of her own womanhood made life with her impossible.

512
00:36:29,984 --> 00:36:31,916
你有目击者吗？一个就够了
Are you prepared with witnesses? One will do.

513
00:36:33,899 --> 00:36:35,298
长官，只有一个问题
Sir, there is only one issue here.

514
00:36:36,659 --> 00:36:39,414
生命实体转移的故事可信吗？
Is the story of life-entity transfer believable?

515
00:36:40,359 --> 00:36:42,599
这班船员去过银河系的很多地方
This crew has been to many places in the galaxy.

516
00:36:42,735 --> 00:36:44,527
目睹过很多奇怪的事件
They've been witness to many strange events.

517
00:36:45,223 --> 00:36:49,915
他们受过训练，知道看似不可能的事情往往是可能的
They are trained to know that what seems to be impossible often is possible,

518
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:52,983
鉴于对这一现象的科学分析
given the scientific analysis of the phenomenon.

519
00:36:54,588 --> 00:36:58,367
史波克先生，你听说过类似珍妮丝·莱斯特博士描述的案例吗？
Mr. Spock, have you ever heard of a case such as described by Dr. Janice Lester?

520
00:36:59,069 --> 00:37:00,397
不确切地说，没有
Not precisely, no.

521
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:03,903
假设你的看法是正确的
Assuming that you are correct in your belief,

522
00:37:05,613 --> 00:37:10,844
你希望星际舰队指挥部安排这个呃…这个呃…人
do you expect Starfleet Command to place this er ... this er ... person

523
00:37:11,489 --> 00:37:13,089
指挥企业号吗？
in command of the Enterprise?

524
00:37:14,043 --> 00:37:17,208
我只希望揭露真相
I expect only to reveal the truth.

525
00:37:17,548 --> 00:37:19,667
随着真相揭开，我不是真的舰长
And with the truth revealed, that I am not really the captain,

526
00:37:19,930 --> 00:37:22,759
并且知道她不会被允许担任舰长
and knowing that she would not be allowed to serve as the captain,

527
00:37:22,837 --> 00:37:25,717
那你就会是舰长！这是肯定的！
then you would be the captain! It is inevitable!

528
00:37:32,756 --> 00:37:34,975
史波克，史波克，放弃吧！
Spock. Spock, give it up!

529
00:37:36,393 --> 00:37:39,337
回归企业号大家庭，所有指控都将被撤销
Return to the Enterprise family. All charges will be dropped

530
00:37:39,384 --> 00:37:43,775
以及在加缪二上暂时战胜了我们所有人的疯狂
and the madness that temporarily overcame all of us on Camus II

531
00:37:43,866 --> 00:37:45,534
会褪色并被遗忘
will fade and be forgotten.

532
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:47,704
莱斯特博士会怎样？
And what will become of Dr. Lester?

533
00:37:49,285 --> 00:37:51,277
莱斯特博士将得到永久照看
Dr. Lester will be cared for always.

534
00:37:51,415 --> 00:37:54,998
这是我过去欠她的责任
It is a debt and a responsibility I owe her from the past.

535
00:37:55,393 --> 00:37:58,941
不，长官，我不会撤回我提出的任何指控
No, sir, I shall not withdraw a single charge that I have made.

536
00:37:59,593 --> 00:38:01,129
你不是柯克舰长
You are not Captain Kirk.

537
00:38:01,435 --> 00:38:03,649
你残忍地占用了他的躯体
You have ruthlessly appropriated his body,

538
00:38:03,966 --> 00:38:06,805
但你内在的生命实体不是柯克舰长的
but the life entity within you is not that of Captain Kirk.

539
00:38:06,875 --> 00:38:09,212
企业号不应该由你由你掌管
You do not belong in charge of the Enterprise

540
00:38:09,212 --> 00:38:12,028
我将尽我所能反抗你
and I shall do everything in my power against you.

541
00:38:19,963 --> 00:38:23,931
丽萨上尉，回放史波克先生长篇大论的最后两句话
Lieutenant Lysa, play back those last two sentences from Mr. Spock's tirade.

542
00:38:29,768 --> 00:38:31,670
企业号不应该由你由你掌管
You do not belong in charge of the Enterprise

543
00:38:31,670 --> 00:38:33,883
我将尽我所能反抗你
and I shall do everything in my power against you.

544
00:38:34,111 --> 00:38:36,031
你听到了你记录在案的陈述
You heard the statements placed into the record by you.

545
00:38:36,492 --> 00:38:37,772
你知道这些话的性质吗？
Do you understand the nature of it?

546
00:38:38,003 --> 00:38:40,693
我知道，而且我坚持这样做
I do. And I stand by it.

547
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:46,848
是叛变！蓄意、报复、疯狂的叛变！
It is mutiny! Deliberate, vindictive, insane at its base!

548
00:38:47,308 --> 00:38:49,868
但已经指控了叛变，这是怂恿叛变
But mutiny is charged, and encouragement to mutiny.

549
00:38:50,167 --> 00:38:51,513
麦考伊医生，斯科特先生，你们听到了！
Doctor McCoy, Mr. Scott, you heard it!

550
00:38:52,801 --> 00:38:55,553
基于这些陈述，用作为企业号舰长赋予我的权力
On the basis of these statements, I call for an immediate vote,

551
00:38:55,824 --> 00:38:58,241
我呼吁立即投票
by the powers granted to me as captain of the Enterprise.

552
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:01,671
宣布休会，随后进行表决
A recess is declared, to be followed by a vote.

553
00:39:02,602 --> 00:39:05,525
是，长官，在我们的首席证人面前立即投票
Yes, sir. An immediate vote before our chief witness

554
00:39:05,581 --> 00:39:09,466
能让她死在某个不起眼的星球上，让真相和她一起被掩埋
can be left to die on some obscure planet with the truth locked away inside of her.

555
00:39:09,471 --> 00:39:11,497
安静！你要安静！
Silence! You will be silent!

556
00:39:13,024 --> 00:39:15,584
已宣布休会，不再进行交叉讨论
A recess has been declared. There will be no cross-discussion.

557
00:39:16,508 --> 00:39:19,644
当我回来时，我们将就叛变的指控进行表决
When I return, we will vote on the charge of mutiny.

558
00:39:21,052 --> 00:39:23,700
此处提供的证据是你做出决定的唯一依据
The evidence presented here is the only basis of your decision.

559
00:39:48,984 --> 00:39:49,816
斯科提
Scotty.

560
00:39:50,204 --> 00:39:50,776
医生
Doctor.

561
00:39:54,270 --> 00:39:54,960
医生
Doctor.

562
00:39:56,124 --> 00:40:00,035
我见过舰长发烧，生病
I've seen the captain feverish, sick,

563
00:40:00,656 --> 00:40:07,534
醉酒，神志不清，害怕，喜出望外，火冒三丈
drunk, delirious, terrified, overjoyed, boiling mad.

564
00:40:08,219 --> 00:40:13,467
但到目前为止，我从未见过他气急败坏地红着脸
But up to now I have never seen him red-faced with hysteria.

565
00:40:15,627 --> 00:40:17,610
我知道我要怎么投票了
I know how I'm going to vote.

566
00:40:18,084 --> 00:40:19,620
我和史波克已经经历过这种情况了
I've been through this with Spock.

567
00:40:20,852 --> 00:40:22,983
他不讲科学，你也不讲科学
He's not being scientific and neither are you.

568
00:40:23,284 --> 00:40:25,076
可能不科学
It may not be scientific,

569
00:40:25,794 --> 00:40:28,994
但如果史波克先生认为它是这样的，那么它就是合乎逻辑的
but if Mr. Spock thinks it happened, then it must be logical.

570
00:40:29,424 --> 00:40:30,485
你不认为我知道吗？
Don't you think I know that?

571
00:40:31,385 --> 00:40:33,692
我的测试表明舰长没有任何问题
My tests show there's nothing wrong with the captain.

572
00:40:34,029 --> 00:40:36,525
这是星际舰队唯一会感兴趣的事实
Now that's the only fact Starfleet's going to be interested in.

573
00:40:38,509 --> 00:40:42,377
总部有总部的问题，我们有我们的问题
Headquarters has its problems, and we have ours.

574
00:40:43,774 --> 00:40:49,086
而现在企业号舰长就是我们的问题
And right now the captain of the Enterprise is our problem.

575
00:40:51,578 --> 00:40:53,760
他们将在几分钟内召集投票
They're going to call for the vote in a few minutes.

576
00:40:53,795 --> 00:40:55,549
让我提出最后一个问题
Let me put one last question.

577
00:40:57,468 --> 00:41:01,308
假设你和我一起投票支持史波克
Suppose you vote with me in favor of Spock.

578
00:41:02,582 --> 00:41:05,462
那意味着二票对一票，史波克是无罪的
That means two votes to one and Spock is free.

579
00:41:07,006 --> 00:41:08,588
你觉得舰长会怎么做？
What do you think the captain will do?

580
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:15,704
我不知道
I don't know.

581
00:41:15,994 --> 00:41:17,880
是的，你知道的，是不是
Aye, you know, all right.

582
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:21,226
他会无法接受
It'll stick in his craw.

583
00:41:21,709 --> 00:41:23,059
他永远不会接受
He'll never accept it.

584
00:41:23,667 --> 00:41:24,755
我们还不知道
We don't know that.

585
00:41:25,581 --> 00:41:26,801
我告诉你他不会接受
I tell you, he won't.

586
00:41:28,354 --> 00:41:32,803
然后，医生，那就是我们反对他的时候了
Then, Doctor, that's the time we move against him.

587
00:41:34,826 --> 00:41:36,425
我们将不得不接管这艘船
We'll have to take over the ship.

588
00:41:37,206 --> 00:41:38,892
我们在谈论叛变，斯科提
We're talking about mutiny, Scotty.

589
00:41:42,138 --> 00:41:42,842
是的
Aye.

590
00:41:47,075 --> 00:41:48,291
你准备好投票了吗？
Are you ready for the vote?

591
00:41:53,918 --> 00:41:57,062
是的，我准备好投票了
Yes. I'm ready for the vote.

592
00:42:06,297 --> 00:42:08,025
播放走廊里的谈话录音
Play the tapes of the conversation in the corridor.

593
00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:10,575
是，长官
Aye, sir.

594
00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:14,668
然后就是我们反对他的时候了
Then's the time we move against him.

595
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:18,013
我们将不得不接管这艘船
We'll have to take over the ship.

596
00:42:21,143 --> 00:42:22,615
我们正在谈论叛变，斯科提
We're talking about mutiny, Scotty.

597
00:42:24,610 --> 00:42:25,175
是的
Aye.

598
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,240
你准备好投票了吗？
Are you ready for the vote?

599
00:42:28,624 --> 00:42:30,590
够了，我们知道我们说了什么
That's enough. We know what was said.

600
00:42:30,896 --> 00:42:33,520
足够判你与叛变者共谋
Enough to convict you of conspiracy with mutineers.

601
00:42:34,065 --> 00:42:35,120
你被指控这个罪名
And you're so charged.

602
00:42:35,195 --> 00:42:37,164
判决，死刑
The sentence, death.

603
00:42:37,843 --> 00:42:38,587
莱姆里先生
Mr. Lemli.

604
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:41,430
星际舰队明确禁止死刑
Starfleet expressly forbids the death penalty.

605
00:42:41,469 --> 00:42:44,303
我所有的高级官员都反对我？
All my senior officers turning against me?

606
00:42:44,530 --> 00:42:46,065
死刑是禁止的
The death penalty is forbidden.

607
00:42:46,432 --> 00:42:47,346
只有一个例外
There's only one exception.

608
00:42:47,794 --> 00:42:48,945
第4号通令
General Order 4.

609
00:42:49,355 --> 00:42:51,726
企业号上还没有官员违反过该命令
It has not been violated by any officer on the Enterprise.

610
00:42:51,933 --> 00:42:52,766
我来负责
I am responsible.

611
00:42:54,059 --> 00:42:55,851
处决将立即执行，去你们的岗位上
The execution will be immediate. Go to your posts.

612
00:42:59,229 --> 00:43:00,637
去你们的岗位上
Go to your posts.

613
00:43:04,356 --> 00:43:06,451
莱姆里先生，带他们去禁闭室
Mr. Lemli, take them to the brig.

614
00:43:06,904 --> 00:43:07,800
准备处决
Prepare for execution.

615
00:43:13,505 --> 00:43:14,289
走啊！
Go on!

616
00:43:34,534 --> 00:43:35,909
舰长一定是疯了
The captain really must be going mad,

617
00:43:35,909 --> 00:43:37,919
如果他认为他能逃过处决
if he thinks he can get away with an execution.

618
00:43:38,302 --> 00:43:41,054
柯克舰长即使疯了也不会下令处决
Captain Kirk wouldn't order an execution even if he were going mad.

619
00:43:41,498 --> 00:43:42,714
那不可能是舰长
That cannot be the captain.

620
00:43:42,985 --> 00:43:44,606
他是谁有什么区别？
What difference does it make who he is?

621
00:43:44,917 --> 00:43:47,038
我们要允许执行处决吗？
Are we going to allow an execution to take place?

622
00:43:47,543 --> 00:43:50,295
如果警卫支持他，我们要如何对抗他？
If security backs him up, how will we fight him?

623
00:43:50,811 --> 00:43:52,667
我将以各种方式和方法与他们战斗
I'll fight them every way and any way I can.

624
00:43:54,416 --> 00:43:56,296
丽萨上尉，将我的决定通知所有部门
Lieutenant Lysa, inform all sectors of my decision.

625
00:43:56,339 --> 00:43:59,603
让每个部门派一名代表去机库甲板的处决地点
Have each section send a representative to the place of execution on the hangar deck.

626
00:43:59,861 --> 00:44:01,634
契科夫先生，离贝尼西亚殖民地有多远？
Mr. Chekov, how far to the Benecia Colony?

627
00:44:02,043 --> 00:44:03,494
正在进入扫描范围
Coming within scanning range.

628
00:44:03,712 --> 00:44:05,504
绘制轨道坐标
Plot coordinates for orbit.

629
00:44:05,674 --> 00:44:08,682
苏鲁先生，完成轨道后锁定坐标
Mr. Sulu, lock into coordinates as soon as orbit is accomplished.

630
00:44:08,959 --> 00:44:11,199
拘留将在贝尼西亚进行
Internment will take place on Benicia.

631
00:44:18,307 --> 00:44:19,267
你们听到我的命令了！
You have received your orders!

632
00:44:23,438 --> 00:44:24,452
你们要服从我的命令！
You will obey my orders!

633
00:44:25,543 --> 00:44:26,978
你们将被指控叛变
You will be charged with mutiny.

634
00:44:29,759 --> 00:44:32,420
你会服从我的命令或者…或者…
You will obey my orders or ... or ...

635
00:44:56,781 --> 00:44:59,101
有那么一刻我…我以为我在舰桥上
For a moment I ... I thought I was up on the bridge.

636
00:44:59,787 --> 00:45:00,593
也许你确实在
Perhaps you were.

637
00:45:01,529 --> 00:45:03,449
也就是说转移是可能被打破的
Then it's possible the transference can be broken.

638
00:45:05,435 --> 00:45:07,557
如果再次发生，我会争取留在那
Well, if it happens again, I'll fight to stay there.

639
00:45:07,716 --> 00:45:09,001
你属于舰桥
The bridge is where you belong.

640
00:45:09,911 --> 00:45:11,019
为了实现这一目标
To accomplish that,

641
00:45:11,299 --> 00:45:13,879
我们每个人都必须准备好抓住任何机会
each of us must be ready to seize any opportunity

642
00:45:13,912 --> 00:45:16,472
冲出这里进行攻击
to break out of here and attack.

643
00:45:43,051 --> 00:45:45,483
亚瑟，转移正在变弱
Arthur, the transference is weakening.

644
00:45:45,867 --> 00:45:46,596
发生了什么？
What happened?

645
00:45:46,764 --> 00:45:48,739
有那么一会儿，我发现自己和囚犯在一起​​
For a moment, I found myself back with the prisoners.

646
00:45:50,817 --> 00:45:53,953
我不要再回去做珍妮丝·莱斯特了
I will not go back to being Janice Lester.

647
00:45:54,370 --> 00:45:55,394
你必须帮我阻止它
You must help me prevent it.

648
00:45:55,909 --> 00:46:00,005
阻止转移的唯一方法是让珍妮丝·莱斯特死
The only way to prevent the transference is by the death of Janice Lester.

649
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:03,768
你必须执行处决
You must carry out the execution.

650
00:46:04,002 --> 00:46:06,648
我不能，我不能
I can't. I can't.

651
00:46:07,512 --> 00:46:09,431
船员们正在叛变
The crew is in mutiny.

652
00:46:11,759 --> 00:46:13,743
你必须帮我杀了她
You must kill her for me.

653
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:17,248
我已经为你做了其他一切事情
I have done everything else for you.

654
00:46:19,292 --> 00:46:20,943
但我不会为你杀人
But I will not murder for you.

655
00:46:20,961 --> 00:46:21,883
那就为你自己做
Then do it for yourself.

656
00:46:34,745 --> 00:46:39,126
如果柯克不死，我们都会被揭露为凶手
If Kirk doesn't die, we'll both be exposed as murderers.

657
00:46:42,317 --> 00:46:43,533
你有其他选择吗？
Does that give you any choice?

658
00:47:02,203 --> 00:47:04,251
剂量应该是加倍致命的
The dosage should be doubly lethal.

659
00:47:07,187 --> 00:47:08,147
是的
It is.

660
00:47:25,181 --> 00:47:28,509
为了防止更多阴谋，你们将被移到独立牢房
To prevent further conspiracy, you will be removed to separate cells.

661
00:47:29,078 --> 00:47:33,101
如果有任何抵抗，将给你们注射镇静剂，直到你们学会合作
If there's any resistance, you'll be given a sedative until you learn cooperation.

662
00:47:34,606 --> 00:47:35,694
莱斯特博士打头
Dr. Lester will be first.

663
00:47:38,569 --> 00:47:39,401
跟着科尔曼医生
Follow Docotr Coleman.

664
00:47:46,183 --> 00:47:48,136
我可以指出吗，舰长…
May I point out, Captain ...

665
00:47:50,254 --> 00:47:50,827
杀了他！
Kill him!

666
00:47:52,578 --> 00:47:53,914
杀了他，啊啊！
Kill him. Aaah!

667
00:48:19,367 --> 00:48:21,380
我失去了与舰长的联系
I've lost to the captain.

668
00:48:21,803 --> 00:48:23,787
我感觉不到詹姆斯·柯克了！
I've lost to James Kirk!

669
00:48:24,058 --> 00:48:25,546
我要你死！
I want you dead!

670
00:48:26,330 --> 00:48:30,858
我要你死！我要你死…
I want you dead! I want you dead ...

671
00:48:33,328 --> 00:48:36,631
哦，我永远不会成为舰长了
Oh, I'm never going to be the captain.

672
00:48:37,248 --> 00:48:38,589
永远
Never.

673
00:48:49,873 --> 00:48:54,575
你是…你是因为我爱你
You are ... You are as I loved you.

674
00:48:55,008 --> 00:48:56,864
杀了他
Kill him.

675
00:48:59,268 --> 00:49:00,164
你能为她做些什么吗？
Can you do anything for her?

676
00:49:04,412 --> 00:49:05,904
我愿意照顾她
I'd like to take care of her.

677
00:49:09,888 --> 00:49:12,768
当然，跟我来
Of course. Come with me.

678
00:49:25,350 --> 00:49:26,351
我不想毁了她
I didn't want to destroy her.

679
00:49:27,735 --> 00:49:30,039
我相信我们都理解，舰长
I'm sure we all understand that, Captain.

680
00:49:31,081 --> 00:49:32,922
她的生活本可以和任何女人一样丰富
Her life could have been as rich as any woman's,

681
00:49:34,233 --> 00:49:34,921
要是…
if only ...

682
00:49:38,557 --> 00:49:39,645
要是
If only.
