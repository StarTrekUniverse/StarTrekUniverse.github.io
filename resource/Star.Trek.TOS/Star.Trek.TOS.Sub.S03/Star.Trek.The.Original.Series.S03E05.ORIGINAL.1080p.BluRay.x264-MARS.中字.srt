00:00:04,692 --> 00:00:07,403
柯克：<i>舰长日志，星历5630.7</i>
KIRK: <i>Captain's log, stardate 5630.7.</i>

2
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:12,784
<i>我们被派去把美杜莎的大使送回家</i>
<i>We have been assigned to convey the Medusans' ambassador back home.</i>

3
00:00:12,951 --> 00:00:18,581
<i>虽然美杜莎人的思想是卓越的，但他们的外表却不是</i>
<i>While the Medusans' thoughts are sublime, their appearance is not.</i>

4
00:00:18,748 --> 00:00:21,459
<i>他们进化成了无形的种族</i>
<i>They have evolved into a formless race,</i>

5
00:00:21,751 --> 00:00:25,505
<i>太过丑陋，以至于任何人类</i>
<i>so utterly hideous that the sight of a Medusan</i>

6
00:00:25,672 --> 00:00:29,300
<i>只要看一眼美杜莎人就会陷入彻底的疯狂</i>
<i>brings total madness to any human who sees one.</i>

7
00:00:29,676 --> 00:00:33,388
马维克先生，我是詹姆斯·柯克，舰长
Mr. Marvick. I am James Kirk, the captain.

8
00:00:33,555 --> 00:00:36,850
你必须在美杜莎大使到来之前离开
You must leave before the Medusan ambassador arrives.

9
00:00:37,016 --> 00:00:39,811
这是史波克先生，我的大副
This is Mr. Spock, my first officer.

10
00:00:39,978 --> 00:00:43,565
你留下来也无妨，但另一位先生……
It's OK for you to remain, but this other gentleman...

11
00:00:43,731 --> 00:00:46,359
斯科特，轮机长，叫我斯科提
Scott, chief engineer. Call me Scotty.

12
00:00:46,526 --> 00:00:48,069
你有面罩吗？
Do you have the visor?

13
00:00:48,236 --> 00:00:51,656
戴上它，瞥见美杜莎的人类会发疯
Wear it. Humans who glimpse Medusans go insane.

14
00:00:51,948 --> 00:00:53,575
我会戴上的
I shall wear it.

15
00:00:53,741 --> 00:00:55,618
我们不要让大使久等
Let's not keep the ambassador waiting.

16
00:00:55,785 --> 00:00:59,539
你和斯科特先生会有很多共同点
You and Mr. Scott will have a great deal in common.

17
00:00:59,706 --> 00:01:02,959
能见到<i>企业号</i>的设计师是一种荣幸
<i>It's a privilege meeting a designer of the Enterprise.</i>

18
00:01:03,126 --> 00:01:08,339
联系行星运输机控制中心
Open a channel to the planet transporter control center.

19
00:01:08,631 --> 00:01:13,803
通知大使和琼斯博士，我们已准备好让他们登机了
Inform the ambassador and Dr. Jones we're ready to beam them aboard.

20
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:16,097
通话完毕
Kirk out.

21
00:01:16,264 --> 00:01:18,725
你确定这个面罩有用吗？
Are you sure this visor will work?

22
00:01:18,975 --> 00:01:22,562
- 对瓦肯人有用  - 你那人类的一半呢？
- It is effective for Vulcans. - What about your human half?

23
00:01:22,729 --> 00:01:24,439
我会控制住的
I shall keep it under control.

24
00:01:24,606 --> 00:01:27,108
传送完成时通知我
Inform me when transport is complete.

25
00:01:57,555 --> 00:02:02,101
欢迎登船，科洛斯大使，我是大副史波克
Welcome aboard, Ambassador Kollos. I am First Officer Spock.

26
00:02:02,268 --> 00:02:04,604
我是琼斯博士
I am Dr. Jones.

27
00:02:06,856 --> 00:02:10,652
大使很荣幸见到你，史波克先生
The ambassador is most honored to meet you, Mr. Spock.

28
00:02:33,216 --> 00:02:35,927
柯克：<i>宇宙，最后的边疆</i>
KIRK: <i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

29
00:02:41,891 --> 00:02:45,979
<i>这些是星舰</i>企业号<i>的航程</i>
<i>These are the voyages of the starship</i> Enterprise.

30
00:02:46,145 --> 00:02:50,274
<i>它的五年任务：探索未知的新世界</i>
<i>Its five-year mission: To explore strange new worlds,</i>

31
00:02:50,441 --> 00:02:54,195
<i>寻找新生命和新文明</i>
<i>to seek out new life and new civilizations,</i>

32
00:02:54,362 --> 00:02:57,573
<i>勇踏前人未至之境</i>
<i>to boldly go where no man has gone before.</i>

33
00:03:54,881 --> 00:03:59,135
- 柯克舰长，我们准备好了  - 乌乎拉，打开所有甲板的频道
- Captain Kirk, we are ready. - Uhura, open a channel to all decks.

34
00:04:01,804 --> 00:04:06,601
- 打开了，长官  - 柯克呼叫所有船员
- Channel open, sir. - This is Kirk to all ship's personnel.

35
00:04:06,851 --> 00:04:10,980
清场计划现已生效，立即清空通道
Clearance plan's now in effect. Clear passageways immediately.

36
00:04:11,147 --> 00:04:15,318
<i>大使将立即被护送到他的住处</i>
<i>The ambassador will be escorted to his quarters at once.</i>

37
00:04:33,211 --> 00:04:37,090
请允许我祝贺你与科洛斯大使一起工作
May I congratulate you on your assignment with Ambassador Kollos.

38
00:04:37,256 --> 00:04:40,176
谢谢，但目前还不确定
Thank you. But it's not yet definite.

39
00:04:40,343 --> 00:04:42,887
这将取决于我是否有能力
It will depend upon my ability to achieve

40
00:04:43,054 --> 00:04:45,056
与大使建立心灵连接
a mind-link with the ambassador.

41
00:04:45,348 --> 00:04:49,352
我相信你会发现这是一种迷人的体验
I'm sure you will find it a fascinating experience.

42
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:53,648
我不知道有人与美杜莎人建立了心灵连接
I wasn't aware anyone had achieved a mind-link with the Medusans.

43
00:04:53,898 --> 00:04:55,316
没人做到过
No one has.

44
00:04:55,483 --> 00:04:58,736
我指的是我尝试过与其他物种的心灵连接
I was referring to mind-links I had attempted with other species.

45
00:05:00,113 --> 00:05:05,660
我听说你拒绝了和大使的工作
I've heard that you turned down the assignment with the ambassador.

46
00:05:05,827 --> 00:05:09,914
我无法接受，我的使命在这里
I was unable to accept. My life is here.

47
00:05:30,768 --> 00:05:34,188
我们到大使的住处了
We have arrived at the ambassador's quarters.

48
00:05:34,647 --> 00:05:37,859
谢谢，通知所有人员返回岗位
Thank you. Notify all hands to return to stations.

49
00:05:38,025 --> 00:05:41,779
- 我们出发吧，曲速2  - 曲速2，长官
- Let's take her out. Warp factor 2. - Warp factor 2, sir.

50
00:05:53,499 --> 00:05:58,045
我希望有机会向大使问好
I would appreciate an opportunity to greet the ambassador.

51
00:06:04,093 --> 00:06:07,179
我相信大使会被迷住的
I'm sure the ambassador would be charmed.

52
00:06:54,685 --> 00:06:56,979
我几乎要嫉妒你的工作了
I almost envy you your assignment.

53
00:06:58,189 --> 00:07:03,444
我在你的脑海中看到你很想取代我的位置
I see in your mind that you are tempted to take my place.

54
00:07:03,611 --> 00:07:05,613
不准确，博士
Not correct, Doctor.

55
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:10,534
尽管我意识到你的思想试图与我的思想联系
Although I am aware of your mind attempting to contact mine.

56
00:07:10,701 --> 00:07:12,036
你生来就是心灵感应者吗？
Were you born a telepath?

57
00:07:12,995 --> 00:07:16,374
是的，这就是为什么我必须在瓦肯星上学习
Yes. That is why I had to study on Vulcan.

58
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:20,670
我明白，我可以带你去你的住处吗？
I understand. May I show you to your quarters?

59
00:07:20,836 --> 00:07:23,130
我想我要在这里待一会儿
I think I'll stay here a bit.

60
00:07:23,297 --> 00:07:28,219
科洛斯大使经常觉得传送过程令人不安
Ambassador Kollos often finds the process of transport unsettling.

61
00:07:28,386 --> 00:07:32,807
我明白，我们船上的外科医生也经常这样抱怨
I understand. Our ship's surgeon often makes the same complaint.

62
00:07:33,307 --> 00:07:36,435
准备好之后呼叫我
Do call when you are ready.

63
00:07:47,905 --> 00:07:51,075
当他看着你时，他看到了什么？
What is it he sees when he looks at you?

64
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:55,162
我必须知道
I must know.

65
00:08:02,336 --> 00:08:06,007
我不明白他们为什么让你和科洛斯一起去
I can't understand why they let you go with Kollos.

66
00:08:06,173 --> 00:08:07,216
他们？
They?

67
00:08:07,383 --> 00:08:10,177
联邦的男性人口
The male population of the Federation.

68
00:08:11,137 --> 00:08:13,139
难道没有人试图说服你放弃吗？
Didn't someone try and talk you out of it?

69
00:08:13,305 --> 00:08:14,682
既然你问了，是的
Now you ask, yes.

70
00:08:14,849 --> 00:08:17,184
我很高兴他没有，否则你不会在这里
I'm glad he didn't. You wouldn't be here.

71
00:08:17,476 --> 00:08:18,936
谢谢你
Thank you.

72
00:08:19,103 --> 00:08:24,400
为什么你和科洛斯在一起就不危险呢？史波克我能理解
Why isn't it dangerous for you to be with Kollos? Spock I can understand.

73
00:08:24,567 --> 00:08:28,195
- 谢谢你，舰长  - 不客气
- Thank you, Captain. - You're very welcome.

74
00:08:28,362 --> 00:08:33,909
据我所知，没有人可以看着科洛斯不发疯
As I understand it, no human can look at Kollos without going mad.

75
00:08:34,076 --> 00:08:37,121
我花了四年时间在瓦肯星进行心智训练
I spent four years on Vulcan studying mental discipline.

76
00:08:37,288 --> 00:08:40,499
- 可怜的姑娘  - 正相反
- You poor girl. - On the contrary.

77
00:08:40,666 --> 00:08:43,961
我会说琼斯博士确实很幸运
I would say Dr. Jones was indeed fortunate.

78
00:08:44,128 --> 00:08:48,340
- 瓦肯星不如我想的有趣  - 喜悦可以是很多东西，博士
- Vulcan is not my idea of fun. - Joy can be many things, Doctor.

79
00:08:48,507 --> 00:08:52,136
我学会了在其他地方无法学到的东西
I learnt to do things impossible to learn anywhere else.

80
00:08:52,303 --> 00:08:55,973
- 读取想法？ - 如何不去读取想法，舰长
- To read minds? - How not to read them, Captain.

81
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:59,685
- 我不明白  - 琼斯博士生来就是心灵感应者
- I don't understand. - Dr. Jones was born a telepath.

82
00:09:03,189 --> 00:09:05,775
瓦肯式思维对我的理智来说是必要的
Vulcan was necessary to my sanity.

83
00:09:05,941 --> 00:09:09,236
大多数人发现无法理解的是
What most humans find impossible to understand

84
00:09:09,403 --> 00:09:13,449
将人们的想法和情感拒之门外的需要
is the need to shut out the bedlam of people's thoughts and emotions.

85
00:09:13,616 --> 00:09:16,744
或者他们自己的想法和情感
Or of their own thoughts and emotions.

86
00:09:17,536 --> 00:09:20,998
我刚刚才注意到你的瓦肯IDIC勋章
I was just noticing your Vulcan IDIC.

87
00:09:22,291 --> 00:09:24,585
这是否提醒着，作为瓦肯人
Is it a reminder that as a Vulcan

88
00:09:24,752 --> 00:09:28,464
你能比我更好地与美杜莎人进行心灵连接？
you can mind-link with the Medusans better than I could?

89
00:09:29,924 --> 00:09:35,805
我怀疑史波克先生戴上最受尊敬的瓦肯勋章
I doubt that Mr. Spock would don the most revered of Vulcan symbols

90
00:09:35,971 --> 00:09:38,182
只是为了惹恼你，琼斯博士
merely to annoy you, Dr. Jones.

91
00:09:38,349 --> 00:09:42,728
事实上，我今晚戴它是为了向你致敬，博士
As a matter of fact, I wear it this evening to honor you, Doctor.

92
00:09:42,895 --> 00:09:44,230
的确
Indeed.

93
00:09:44,396 --> 00:09:48,442
有意思，我甚至可以说很吸引人，但说回你的任务
Interesting. I might even say fascinating. But back to your mission.

94
00:09:48,609 --> 00:09:53,781
有没有办法在星舰上雇佣美杜莎导航员？
Can a way be found to employ Medusan navigators on starships?

95
00:09:53,948 --> 00:09:58,953
- 它会解决我们的问题  - 关键是瓦肯心灵连接
- It would solve our problems. - The key is the Vulcan mind-link.

96
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:03,833
一旦我们与美杜莎人形成了联合智慧体
Once we have formed a corporate intelligence with the Medusans,

97
00:10:03,999 --> 00:10:08,921
像拉里一样的设计师就可以致力于适配仪器了
the designers, like Larry, can work on adapting instruments.

98
00:10:09,088 --> 00:10:12,383
我不在乎美杜莎人有多仁慈
I don't care how benevolent the Medusans are.

99
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:17,847
和丑到让人发疯的东西打交道难道不是自杀吗？
Isn't it suicidal to deal with something ugly enough to drive men mad?

100
00:10:18,013 --> 00:10:23,811
我看你仍然赞同古希腊人的观念
I see you still subscribe to the notion promulgated by the ancient Greeks

101
00:10:23,978 --> 00:10:27,106
好的东西也必须是美丽的
that what is good must also be beautiful.

102
00:10:27,273 --> 00:10:31,735
反之，美丽的东西自然会被认为是好的
And the reverse. What is beautiful is automatically expected to be good.

103
00:10:31,902 --> 00:10:37,741
我们大多数人都被美丽所吸引，对丑陋排斥
Most of us are attracted by beauty, repelled by ugliness.

104
00:10:38,033 --> 00:10:42,204
冒着听起来有偏见的风险，先生们，敬美丽的人
At the risk of sounding prejudiced, gentlemen, here's to beauty.

105
00:10:43,247 --> 00:10:47,418
敬米兰达·琼斯，有史以来星舰上最可爱的人类
To Miranda Jones, the loveliest human ever to grace a starship.

106
00:10:49,545 --> 00:10:55,801
一个如此美丽的人，怎么能迫使自己永远看丑陋呢？
How can one so beautiful condemn herself to look upon ugliness forever?

107
00:10:55,968 --> 00:10:58,971
- 我们会允许它发生吗？ - 当然不会
- Will we allow it? - Certainly not.

108
00:10:59,138 --> 00:11:01,640
像你这样充满欢乐怎么能
How can one so full of joy as you

109
00:11:01,807 --> 00:11:06,812
迫使自己在余生中看着疾病和痛苦呢？
condemn yourself to look upon disease and suffering for the rest of your life?

110
00:11:06,979 --> 00:11:09,940
我们会允许它发生吗，先生们？
Can we allow that, gentlemen?

111
00:11:10,107 --> 00:11:12,943
敬你最想要的，米兰达
To whatever you want the most, Miranda.

112
00:11:22,077 --> 00:11:24,413
再来点安塔瑞安白兰地？
Some more Antarean brandy?

113
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:29,251
那是什么？
What is it?

114
00:11:30,711 --> 00:11:34,632
附近有人在想谋杀的事
There's somebody nearby thinking of murder.

115
00:11:43,641 --> 00:11:46,310
- 这个房间里？ - 现在走了
- In this room? - It's gone now.

116
00:11:47,978 --> 00:11:50,606
是谁？你能看出来吗？
Who is it? Can you tell?

117
00:11:53,192 --> 00:11:55,569
它不在了
It isn't there anymore.

118
00:11:56,946 --> 00:12:01,492
- 你介意我说晚安吗？ - 我送你到你的宿舍
- Would you mind if I said goodnight? - I'll see you to your quarters.

119
00:12:01,659 --> 00:12:06,288
谢谢，先生们，你做出了一个不可能的选择
Thank you, gentlemen. You make a choice impossible.

120
00:12:06,538 --> 00:12:08,791
请待在这里玩得开心
Please, stay and enjoy yourselves.

121
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:13,837
- 这是一顿愉快的晚餐  - 睡个好觉，米兰达
- It was a delightful dinner. - Sleep well, Miranda.

122
00:12:16,382 --> 00:12:19,301
你自己能找到路吗？
Are you well enough to find your way alone?

123
00:12:19,468 --> 00:12:22,846
当然，请不要担心我
Of course. Please don't worry about me.

124
00:12:31,563 --> 00:12:34,650
在我的家乡，我们称之为淑女
Where I come from, that's what we call a lady.

125
00:12:34,817 --> 00:12:37,778
- 她很特别  - 非常特别
- She is something special. - Very special.

126
00:12:37,945 --> 00:12:40,322
我建议你也这样对待她
I suggest you treat her accordingly.

127
00:12:40,489 --> 00:12:46,328
我认识她很久了，我知道她非凡的天赋
I've known her long enough to be aware of her remarkable gifts.

128
00:12:47,413 --> 00:12:50,749
今天对我来说是漫长的一天
Well, it's been a long day for me.

129
00:12:50,916 --> 00:12:53,669
你愿意和我一起在轮机部停一下吗？
Would you like to stop off at engineering with me?

130
00:12:53,836 --> 00:12:55,546
我有几件事要检查
I have a few things to check.

131
00:12:55,713 --> 00:12:59,925
一瓶苏格兰威士忌说你无法处理你设计的控件
A bottle of Scotch says you can't handle the controls you designed.

132
00:13:00,092 --> 00:13:03,554
- 下次吧  - 晚安，先生们
- Some other time. - Goodnight, gentlemen.

133
00:13:04,638 --> 00:13:06,724
为这个场合特意打扮了？非常令人印象深刻
Dressed up for the occasion? Very impressive.

134
00:13:07,433 --> 00:13:10,352
我是真心想向她致敬
I genuinely intended to honor her.

135
00:13:10,519 --> 00:13:14,023
- 晚上好，先生们  - 晚上好，睡个好觉。
- Good evening, gentlemen. - Good evening. Sleep well.

136
00:13:16,525 --> 00:13:21,530
- 这个女孩有什么让你烦恼的？ - 她不是普通的女孩
- What's troubling you with the girl? - She's not just another girl.

137
00:13:21,697 --> 00:13:24,867
- 别犯那种错误  -我没那么想
- Don't make that mistake. - I didn't think that.

138
00:13:25,034 --> 00:13:29,288
我不知道它到底是什么，她似乎非常脆弱
I don't know what it is exactly. She seems very vulnerable.

139
00:13:29,455 --> 00:13:34,168
在某种程度上我们都很脆弱
We're all vulnerable in one way or another.

140
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:38,630
当然，但她身上有一些非常令人不安的东西
Of course. But there's something very disturbing about her.

141
00:13:40,424 --> 00:13:44,094
说明她是个十足的女人，我同意
Meaning she's quite a woman. I agree.

142
00:13:47,973 --> 00:13:51,060
- 晚安，吉姆  - 晚安，老骨头
- Goodnight, Jim. - Goodnight, Bones.

143
00:14:08,452 --> 00:14:10,245
[门铃声]
[DOOR BUZZES]

144
00:14:10,537 --> 00:14:12,748
男：米兰达？
MAN: Miranda?

145
00:14:15,209 --> 00:14:19,671
- 是谁？ - 拉里，我得和你谈谈
- Who is it? - Larry. I've got to talk to you.

146
00:14:19,963 --> 00:14:23,425
- 很晚了  - 拜托，这一点很重要
- It's late. - Please. It's important.

147
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:27,638
好的，那进来吧
All right. Come in, then.

148
00:14:31,975 --> 00:14:35,604
我以为晚餐永远不会结束了
I thought the dinner was never going to end.

149
00:14:35,771 --> 00:14:39,024
我倒是很享受
I rather enjoyed it.

150
00:14:39,191 --> 00:14:40,984
是的，我知道你很享受
Yes, I know you did.

151
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:46,156
我没有，你离得那么远
I didn't. You were so far away.

152
00:14:50,119 --> 00:14:54,289
- 我很快就会离得更远  - 请不要提它
- I'll be further away than that soon. - Please don't talk of that.

153
00:14:54,456 --> 00:14:59,586
时间太少了请，米兰达，不要和科洛斯一起走
There's so little time. Please, Miranda. Don't go with Kollos.

154
00:14:59,753 --> 00:15:03,173
我们已经一次又一次地讨论过这个问题了
We've been over this time and time again.

155
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:05,467
我难道不知道吗？
Don't I know.

156
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:11,098
我问过你了，在餐馆里，在实验室里，单膝跪地，双膝跪地
I've asked you in restaurants, in the laboratory, on one knee, both knees.

157
00:15:14,435 --> 00:15:18,856
- 你怎么能这样做？ - 请试着理解
- How can you do this? - Please, try to understand.

158
00:15:19,022 --> 00:15:25,195
我明白，你是女人，我是男人，你的同类之一
I understand. You're a woman, and I'm a man, one of your own kind.

159
00:15:25,362 --> 00:15:28,574
科洛斯永远不会给你这样的东西
Kollos will never give you anything like this.

160
00:15:42,796 --> 00:15:46,884
- 为什么我会遇见你？ - 我一直对你诚实
- Why did I ever meet you? - I've been honest with you.

161
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:50,137
我只是不能像你希望的那样爱你
I simply cannot love you the way you want me to.

162
00:15:50,304 --> 00:15:51,513
米兰达
Miranda.

163
00:15:51,763 --> 00:15:55,225
我要和科洛斯一起离开，就这么定了
And I'm going away with Kollos. That's final.

164
00:15:56,977 --> 00:15:59,313
我想你最好现在离开
I think you'd better leave now.

165
00:16:07,613 --> 00:16:09,656
所以，是你
So it's you.

166
00:16:13,035 --> 00:16:16,163
之前我不知道是你
I didn't know that it was you before.

167
00:16:18,081 --> 00:16:21,335
你想杀谁？我吗？
Who is it you want to kill? Is it me?

168
00:16:26,423 --> 00:16:28,926
你不能把这件事藏在心里
You mustn't keep this to yourself.

169
00:16:29,218 --> 00:16:32,679
- 我想要帮你  - 现在你想帮我了？
- I want to help you. - So now you want to help me?

170
00:16:34,223 --> 00:16:38,602
现在我知道一个普通人要做什么才能得到你的回应了
Now I know what a mere human has to do to get a reaction out of you.

171
00:16:38,769 --> 00:16:41,230
让你觉得他是个病人
Make you think he's a patient.

172
00:16:42,898 --> 00:16:48,111
伟大的心理学家，你为什么不试着改变一下做一个女人呢？
A great psychologist. Why don't you try being a woman for a change?

173
00:19:08,669 --> 00:19:10,671
斯科特先生在哪里？
Where's Mr. Scott?

174
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:15,384
米兰达？
Miranda?

175
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:17,302
米兰达？
Miranda?

176
00:19:18,929 --> 00:19:22,099
所以你忍不住要打一个小赌？
So you couldn't resist a wee wager?

177
00:19:24,685 --> 00:19:27,896
大使受伤了吗？
Has the ambassador been hurt?

178
00:19:28,063 --> 00:19:32,901
- 他没有受到任何伤害  - 谁干的？
- No harm has come to him. - Who could have done it?

179
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,237
拉里·马维克
Larry Marvick.

180
00:19:35,404 --> 00:19:39,324
拉里·马维克？为什么？
Larry Marvick? Why?

181
00:19:39,491 --> 00:19:42,202
他看到美杜莎了吗？
Did he see the Medusan?

182
00:19:42,494 --> 00:19:46,456
- 是的，他看到了  - 那么结果就是精神错乱
- Yes, he did. - Then insanity will be the result.

183
00:19:46,748 --> 00:19:48,709
危险的精神错乱
Dangerous insanity.

184
00:19:48,875 --> 00:19:50,585
你来接管
The controls are all yours.

185
00:19:50,752 --> 00:19:54,297
如果你处理得好，苏格兰威士忌就会在你的房间里
The Scotch will be in your room if you handle them.

186
00:19:56,925 --> 00:19:59,803
<i>柯克舰长呼叫所有船员，红色警报</i>
<i>Captain Kirk to all ship personnel. Red Alert.</i>

187
00:20:00,095 --> 00:20:02,723
<i>有人企图谋杀科洛斯</i>
<i>An attempt was made to murder Kollos.</i>

188
00:20:02,889 --> 00:20:04,808
<i>凶手是个疯子</i>
<i>The murderer is insane.</i>

189
00:20:04,975 --> 00:20:08,937
<i>他是劳伦斯·马维克，留意他，通话完毕</i>
<i>He is Lawrence Marvick. Watch for him. Kirk out.</i>

00:20:38,884 --> 00:20:40,802

191
00:20:40,969 --> 00:20:43,472
解释一下，苏鲁上尉？
Explain, Lieutenant Sulu?

192
00:20:44,514 --> 00:20:48,268
真不敢相信，但我们正在以曲速8.5飞行
I don't believe this, but we're traveling warp factor 8.5.

193
00:20:48,435 --> 00:20:51,521
- 并且还在加速  - 接轮机部，乌乎拉
- And accelerating. - Get engineering, Uhura.

194
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:56,651
他们不回答，舰长
They don't answer, Captain.

195
00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:06,286
曲速9，还在加速
Warp factor 9 and accelerating.

196
00:21:06,453 --> 00:21:08,413
你不能从那里解除动力吗？
Can't you disengage power from there?

197
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:09,623
我正在努力
I'm trying.

198
00:21:09,915 --> 00:21:12,626
契科夫先生，请你协助。
Mr. Chekov, your assistance, please.

199
00:21:14,878 --> 00:21:18,340
- 现在接通轮机部了  - 接入内部通话系统
- I have engineering now. - Put them on intercom.

200
00:21:18,507 --> 00:21:22,636
马维克： <i>我们决不能睡觉！他们会进入你的梦中！这是最糟糕的</i>
MARVICK: <i>We mustn't sleep! They come into your dreams! That's the worst.</i>

201
00:21:22,802 --> 00:21:27,724
- <i>我们要离开这里了</i>  - 警卫部到轮机部去
- <i>We're making it out of here.</i> - Security to engineering.

202
00:21:27,891 --> 00:21:29,893
- 我跟你一起走  - 不
- I'll go with you. - No.

203
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:33,104
我必须去，我能接触到他的思想
I must. I can reach his mind.

204
00:21:38,318 --> 00:21:42,322
我们在宇宙的边界上将是安全的，我们将是安全的！
We'll be safe on the boundaries of the universe. We'll be safe!

205
00:22:04,636 --> 00:22:08,682
- 斯科提，我们在哪儿？ - 我不知道
- Scotty, where are we? - I don't know.

206
00:22:08,848 --> 00:22:12,644
超越银河系的边界，我们做到了，我们安全了
Beyond the boundaries of the galaxy. We made it. We're safe.

207
00:22:12,811 --> 00:22:15,063
我们很安全，柯克舰长
We're safe, Captain Kirk.

208
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:16,773
老骨头
Bones.

209
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:21,444
不，不，舰长，我们不能睡觉，不，不
No. No, Captain. We mustn't sleep. No. No.

210
00:22:21,611 --> 00:22:26,116
他们进入你的梦中，在你的梦中使你窒息
They come in your dreams. They suffocate in your dreams.

211
00:22:26,283 --> 00:22:29,869
好的，我们会带你到一个地方躲起来
All right. We'll take you to a place to hide.

212
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:32,872
- 来吧  - 不，我想留在这里
- Come on. - No, I want to stay here.

213
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:36,585
准备加速！加速前往下一个星系！
Ready to speed! Speed to the next galaxy!

214
00:22:39,921 --> 00:22:41,673
米兰达
Miranda.

215
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:44,676
米兰达，你来了，与我一起
Miranda, you're here. With me.

216
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:48,972
是的，拉里
Yes, Larry.

217
00:22:50,557 --> 00:22:52,726
我在这
I'm here.

218
00:22:55,353 --> 00:23:00,400
我没有失去你，我美丽的爱人，我以为我失去了你
I didn't lose you. My beautiful love, I thought I'd lost you.

219
00:23:00,567 --> 00:23:03,111
我在这里，拉里
I am here, Larry.

220
00:23:07,866 --> 00:23:12,829
不，我能看到他看到的，不，不要
No. I can see what he sees. No, don't.

221
00:23:14,372 --> 00:23:17,751
- 别去想它  - 骗子，骗子
- Don't think of it. - Liar. Liar.

222
00:23:18,043 --> 00:23:21,379
骗子，你不是一个人，它在这里
Deceiver. You're not alone. It's here.

223
00:23:21,546 --> 00:23:26,176
你把它带来了！骗子！骗子！
You brought it with you! Liar! Liar!

224
00:23:26,426 --> 00:23:28,219
骗子！
Liar!

225
00:23:30,055 --> 00:23:34,893
不要爱她！不要爱她！如果你爱她，她会杀了你！
Don't love her! Don't love her! She'll kill you if you love her!

226
00:23:38,563 --> 00:23:42,025
我爱你，米兰达
I love you, Miranda.

227
00:23:52,994 --> 00:23:54,954
他死了，吉姆
He's dead, Jim.

228
00:24:13,264 --> 00:24:16,643
柯克：<i>舰长日志，星历5630.8</i>
KIRK: <i>Captain's log, stardate 5630.8.</i>

229
00:24:16,935 --> 00:24:19,312
<i>由于马维克疯狂的恐惧</i>
<i>As a result of Marvick's insane fears,</i>

230
00:24:19,479 --> 00:24:23,942
企业号<i>被遗弃在未知的太空中</i>
<i>the</i> Enterprise <i>lies derelict in uncharted space.</i>

231
00:24:24,234 --> 00:24:27,904
<i>我们无法确定我们在银河系中的位置</i>
<i>We have no way to determine our position in the galaxy.</i>

232
00:24:28,071 --> 00:24:31,866
<i>我们处于一个完全未知的空白地带</i>
<i>We are in a completely unknown void.</i>

233
00:24:36,454 --> 00:24:40,083
- 我们在哪？ - 从缺乏参照物的情况来看
- Where are we? - Evidently far outside our own galaxy,

234
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:43,002
显然远在我们的星系之外
judging from the lack of reference points.

235
00:24:43,169 --> 00:24:48,758
当我们超过曲速9.5时，我们进入了一个时空连续体
When we exceeded warp speed 9.5, we entered a space-time continuum.

236
00:24:48,925 --> 00:24:51,469
我有马维克的尸检报告
I have the autopsy report on Marvick.

237
00:24:51,636 --> 00:24:53,304
心跳停止，原因不明
Heart action stop, cause unknown,

238
00:24:53,471 --> 00:24:56,766
呼吸停止，原因不明，脑...
respiration stop, cause unknown, brain...

239
00:24:56,933 --> 00:25:00,103
- 要我继续吗？ - 你是说他就这么死了？
- Shall I go on? - You mean he just simply died?

240
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:04,274
- 他无法忍受他所看到的  - 或者他感受到的
- He could not live with what he saw. - Or what he felt.

241
00:25:04,441 --> 00:25:06,025
损坏报告
Damage report.

242
00:25:06,192 --> 00:25:10,029
我们需要一些修理，但船是完整的
We need some repairs but the ship is intact.

243
00:25:10,196 --> 00:25:13,825
- 位置报告  - 无法计算
- Position report. - Impossible to calculate.

244
00:25:13,992 --> 00:25:17,871
我们缺乏可供分析的数据，仪器工作正常
We lack data to analyze. Instruments are functioning normally

245
00:25:18,037 --> 00:25:20,457
但现实的东西没有意义
but what they tell us makes no sense.

246
00:25:20,623 --> 00:25:24,794
我们的记录清楚地记下了我们离开我们星系的地方
Our records are clear to the point where we left our galaxy.

247
00:25:24,961 --> 00:25:27,213
我们应该能够导航回去
We should be able to navigate back.

248
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:30,508
我们缺乏返回的参考点
We lack reference points for returning.

249
00:25:30,675 --> 00:25:36,598
我们经历了感官失真，如果我们使用曲速，还会这样
We experienced sensory distortion, and will do again if we use warp speed.

250
00:25:36,765 --> 00:25:39,726
我们无法重新穿过障碍
We cannot recross the barrier.

251
00:25:39,893 --> 00:25:45,565
一个疯子让我们陷入了这个境地，现在看起来只有疯子才能让我们脱身
A madman got us into this, and it looks like only a madman can get us out.

252
00:25:45,732 --> 00:25:49,861
一个有趣的建议，契科夫先生，但没什么帮助
An entertaining suggestion, Mr. Chekov, but not very helpful.

253
00:25:50,028 --> 00:25:54,783
船上有个人兴许能帮我们导航
There is someone else aboard who might be able to help us navigate.

254
00:25:54,949 --> 00:25:58,244
美杜莎人已经将航海技术发展为一门艺术
The Medusans have developed navigation to a fine art.

255
00:25:58,411 --> 00:26:03,416
感官失真的情况下科洛斯还能正常工作吗？
Could Kollos function despite the sensory distortion?

256
00:26:03,583 --> 00:26:09,422
可能吧，美杜莎的感官系统与我们的完全不同
Possibly. The Medusan sensory system is radically different from ours.

257
00:26:09,589 --> 00:26:14,928
也许为了应对这个紧急情况，我可以成为科洛斯
Perhaps for the purpose of this emergency, I might become Kollos.

258
00:26:15,094 --> 00:26:17,680
- 解释一下  - 融合
- Explain. - A fusion.

259
00:26:17,847 --> 00:26:20,600
创建双重实体的心灵连接
A mind-link to create a double entity.

260
00:26:20,892 --> 00:26:25,063
每个人都会享受两者的知识和感官能力
Each would enjoy the knowledge and sensory capabilities of both.

261
00:26:25,230 --> 00:26:28,233
- 我们将作为一个整体运作  - 风险呢？
- We will function as one being. - Hazards?

262
00:26:29,234 --> 00:26:34,072
如果连接成功，将有失去独立身份的倾向
If the link is successful, there will be a tendency to lose separate identity.

263
00:26:34,239 --> 00:26:36,282
不得不承担的风险
A necessary risk.

264
00:26:36,574 --> 00:26:39,369
琼斯博士不会希望允许我
Dr. Jones will not wish to give me permission

265
00:26:39,536 --> 00:26:40,870
完成心灵链接
to accomplish the mind-link.

266
00:26:41,037 --> 00:26:45,375
我认为她不会希望任何人干涉她与科洛斯的关系
I don't think she'll want anyone to intrude in her rapport with Kollos.

267
00:26:45,542 --> 00:26:50,171
每次我要求与科洛斯交谈时，她都表现出不情愿
She has shown reluctance every time I've asked to converse with Kollos.

268
00:26:50,338 --> 00:26:54,217
在某些方面，她仍然是个凡人，舰长
In some ways, she is still most human, Captain,

269
00:26:54,384 --> 00:26:57,387
尤其是她的嫉妒心
particularly in the depth of her jealousy.

270
00:26:58,346 --> 00:27:02,100
- 我可以把她关在宿舍里  - 那不够
- I could confine her to quarters. - Not sufficient.

271
00:27:02,267 --> 00:27:04,727
她的心灵感应能力很强大
Her telepathic powers are formidable.

272
00:27:04,894 --> 00:27:10,984
她的注意力必须非常投入，我所做的一切才不会惊动她
Her mind must be so engaged that no thought of what I do shall intrude.

273
00:27:11,150 --> 00:27:14,237
我觉得那可以做到
I think that could be arranged.

274
00:27:19,367 --> 00:27:24,747
也许是我多愁善感了，但这是我最喜欢的地方，地球
I may be sentimental, but this is my favorite place. Earth.

275
00:27:24,914 --> 00:27:27,000
我从未去过地球
I've never been to Earth.

276
00:27:28,209 --> 00:27:31,004
多么可爱的花朵
What lovely flowers.

277
00:27:31,170 --> 00:27:33,756
- 我可以碰它们吗？ - 当然
- May I touch them? - Certainly.

278
00:27:48,354 --> 00:27:51,149
他们没有气味
They have no scent.

279
00:27:51,316 --> 00:27:53,359
试试这些
Try these.

280
00:28:04,329 --> 00:28:06,748
让我看看
Let me see.

281
00:28:08,291 --> 00:28:10,543
它只是一根刺
It's just a thorn.

282
00:28:11,878 --> 00:28:15,548
我希望今天能让你忘记这件事
I was hoping to make you forget about this today.

283
00:28:15,715 --> 00:28:18,134
不痛了
It doesn't hurt any more.

284
00:28:21,304 --> 00:28:26,184
你不能责怪自己，因为马维克爱你
You mustn't blame yourself because Marvick loved you.

285
00:28:26,351 --> 00:28:30,980
我不想要他的爱，我无以回报
I didn't want his love. I couldn't return it.

286
00:28:31,147 --> 00:28:35,902
总有一天，你会想要人类的爱和陪伴
Someday, you'll want human love and companionship.

287
00:28:36,069 --> 00:28:39,948
我可以告诉你人类的陪伴对我意味着什么吗？
Shall I tell you what human companionship means to me?

288
00:28:40,114 --> 00:28:44,535
一种挣扎，对他人情感的防御
A struggle. A defense against the emotions of others.

289
00:28:44,702 --> 00:28:47,288
有时，情绪会突然涌上我的心头
At times, the emotions burst in on me.

290
00:28:47,455 --> 00:28:50,124
仇恨，欲望，嫉妒
Hatred, desire, envy.

291
00:28:50,291 --> 00:28:53,920
同情，同情是最糟糕的
Pity. Pity is the worst of all.

292
00:28:54,087 --> 00:28:56,756
我同意瓦肯人的观点
I agree with the Vulcans.

293
00:28:56,923 --> 00:28:59,842
暴力情绪是一种精神错乱
Violent emotion is a kind of insanity.

294
00:29:09,686 --> 00:29:11,771
你愿意与美杜莎人共度一生
You're willing to spend your life

295
00:29:11,938 --> 00:29:14,774
来避免感情用事？
with the Medusans in order to avoid emotion?

296
00:29:15,650 --> 00:29:17,902
也许吧
Perhaps.

297
00:29:18,069 --> 00:29:22,949
情投意合是很好，但是爱呢？
A meeting of minds is all very well, but what about love?

298
00:29:23,116 --> 00:29:25,201
你年轻
You're young.

299
00:29:27,286 --> 00:29:30,248
有魅力，有人性
Attractive. And human.

300
00:29:31,374 --> 00:29:35,670
迟早，不管他们的心灵多么美好
Sooner or later, no matter how beautiful their minds are,

301
00:29:35,837 --> 00:29:39,424
你会渴望一个长得像你的人
you're going to yearn for someone who looks like yourself,

302
00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:42,051
一个不丑的人
someone who isn't ugly.

303
00:29:42,969 --> 00:29:46,514
丑？什么是丑？
Ugly? What is ugly?

304
00:29:46,681 --> 00:29:50,893
谁能说科洛斯是丑得无法忍受？ 
Who is to say whether Kollos is too ugly to bear?

305
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:53,813
还是美得无法忍受？
Or too beautiful to bear?

306
00:29:54,439 --> 00:29:58,693
米兰达，我无意冒犯，拜托
Miranda, I meant no insult. Please.

307
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:12,707
我们置身于玫瑰中，非常浪漫的环境
Here we are among the roses. A very romantic setting.

308
00:30:14,542 --> 00:30:17,211
我希望还有月光
I wish there were moonlight too.

309
00:30:17,378 --> 00:30:20,214
月光会很适合你
Moonlight would suit you very well.

310
00:30:21,966 --> 00:30:25,470
我知道你是个很复杂的人
I see you're a very complicated man.

311
00:30:30,224 --> 00:30:33,269
- 科洛斯，你不能让他这样做  - 别
- Kollos, you mustn't let him do it. - Don't.

312
00:30:33,436 --> 00:30:37,565
让我走，你不知道史波克正在计划着多么危险的事情
Let me go. You have no idea what a dangerous thing Spock is planning.

313
00:30:37,732 --> 00:30:40,860
我们必须阻止他，让我走！
We must stop him. Let me go!

314
00:30:52,121 --> 00:30:56,584
<i>企业号</i>处于危险之中，你不能被卷入
The <i>Enterprise</i> is at stake. It is not possible for you to be involved.

315
00:30:59,962 --> 00:31:01,839
为什么？我承诺会进行心灵连接
Why? I've committed myself to mind-link

316
00:31:02,006 --> 00:31:04,258
当我们接近美杜莎船只时
when we reach the Medusan vessel.

317
00:31:04,550 --> 00:31:08,346
- 为什么要让自己处于危险中？ - 这不是你可以承担的责任
- Why put yourself in jeopardy? - This is not a duty you can assume.

318
00:31:08,513 --> 00:31:12,517
我知道你的心灵感应能力可能比我强
I know your telepathic competence might be superior to mine

319
00:31:13,476 --> 00:31:15,520
但还有一个更重要的因素
but there's a more important factor.

320
00:31:15,686 --> 00:31:21,234
目标是驾驶这艘船，那是你做不到的
The object is to pilot this ship. That is something you cannot do.

321
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:25,321
教我操作这艘船，我可以瞬间记住
Teach me to operate the ship. I can memorize instantly.

322
00:31:25,488 --> 00:31:31,494
等一下，我意识到你几乎可以做任何有视力的人能做到的事情
Wait a minute. I realize you can do almost anything a sighted person can.

323
00:31:31,786 --> 00:31:35,039
但是你不能驾驶一艘星舰
But you can't pilot a starship.

324
00:31:37,625 --> 00:31:39,710
什么？
What?

325
00:31:42,129 --> 00:31:43,840
真有趣
Fascinating.

326
00:31:44,006 --> 00:31:47,802
对不起，但你必须现实一点
I'm sorry, but you must be realistic.

327
00:31:47,969 --> 00:31:52,890
你是盲人，有些事情你根本做不到
You are blind. There are some things you simply cannot do.

328
00:31:57,019 --> 00:32:00,273
显然是一个高度复杂的传感器网络
Evidently a highly sophisticated sensor web.

329
00:32:00,439 --> 00:32:03,818
我向你和你的裁缝师致敬
My compliments to you and to your dressmaker.

330
00:32:04,110 --> 00:32:07,613
当然，这是唯一合理的解释
Of course. It's the only reasonable explanation.

331
00:32:07,864 --> 00:32:11,951
你看不见，所以科洛斯伤不了你
You can't see and Kollos can't hurt you.

332
00:32:12,118 --> 00:32:13,995
一个优雅的解决方案
An elegant solution.

333
00:32:14,161 --> 00:32:20,501
但我不明白你为什么要隐瞒你的失明
But I fail to understand why you try to conceal your blindness.

334
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:23,004
我觉得我明白了
I think I understand.

335
00:32:23,170 --> 00:32:29,051
你说同情是最糟糕的
You said that pity is the worst of all.

336
00:32:29,218 --> 00:32:33,431
我讨厌同情
Pity. Which I hate.

337
00:32:36,017 --> 00:32:39,353
你认为你用眼睛得到的信息
Do you think you get more information with your eyes

338
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:41,564
比我用传感器更多吗？
than I do with my sensors?

339
00:32:41,731 --> 00:32:46,485
我可以和你一起打网球，柯克舰长，我甚至可能打败你
I could play tennis with you, Captain Kirk. I might even beat you.

340
00:32:46,777 --> 00:32:53,075
我正好站在离门1.04米的地方
I am standing exactly one meter four centimeters from the door.

341
00:32:53,242 --> 00:32:56,120
你能那么精确地判断距离吗？
Can you judge distance that accurately?

342
00:32:56,370 --> 00:33:00,625
我甚至可以告诉你你的心跳有多快
I can even tell you how fast your heart is beating.

343
00:33:00,791 --> 00:33:02,835
那没有必要
That won't be necessary.

344
00:33:03,002 --> 00:33:07,340
史波克先生将进行心灵连接，没有其他决定
Mr. Spock will make the mind-link. No other decision is possible.

345
00:33:07,632 --> 00:33:10,635
不，我不会让你这么做的
No. I won't let you.

346
00:33:10,801 --> 00:33:12,511
求你了
Please.

347
00:33:12,762 --> 00:33:15,014
不要像这样反抗我们，琼斯博士
Do not fight us like this, Dr. Jones.

348
00:33:15,181 --> 00:33:18,476
我以同事的身份向你发出呼吁，不要阻挠我们
I appeal to you as a colleague. Do not oppose us.

349
00:33:18,643 --> 00:33:21,520
- 不 - 如果我们不能说服你
- No. - If we can't persuade you,

350
00:33:21,687 --> 00:33:23,898
有人可以
there is someone who can.

351
00:33:24,190 --> 00:33:27,777
你得和科洛斯一起解决这个问题
You'll have to take this up with Kollos.

352
00:33:28,069 --> 00:33:31,030
为你自己着想
For your own sake.

353
00:33:56,847 --> 00:33:59,308
老骨头，你为什么不告诉我？
Bones, why hadn't you told me?

354
00:33:59,475 --> 00:34:04,188
如果她想让你知道，她会告诉你的，我尊重她的隐私
She would have told you if she wanted you to know. I respect her privacy.

355
00:34:04,355 --> 00:34:07,483
这位女士有很多值得尊敬的地方
There's a great deal to respect about that lady.

356
00:34:07,650 --> 00:34:09,652
[尖叫]
[SCREAM]

357
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:20,621
看来我别无选择，只能听你的了
It seems I have no choice but to obey you.

358
00:34:24,333 --> 00:34:26,377
柯克：<i>舰长日志，补充</i>
KIRK: <i>Captain's log, supplementary.</i>

359
00:34:26,544 --> 00:34:28,879
<i>我们返回银河系的唯一机会</i>
<i>Our one chance to return to our galaxy</i>

360
00:34:29,046 --> 00:34:31,549
<i>取决于美杜莎大使的</i>
<i>is dependent upon the navigational skills</i>

361
00:34:31,716 --> 00:34:34,135
<i>导航技能</i>
<i>of the Medusan ambassador.</i>

362
00:34:34,301 --> 00:34:39,807
<i>科洛斯已被带到舰桥，并被放置在防护罩后面</i>
<i>Kollos has been brought to the bridge and placed behind a protective shield.</i>

363
00:35:34,570 --> 00:35:37,698
这是令人愉快的
This is delightful.

364
00:35:37,907 --> 00:35:40,951
我认识你们所有人
I know you. All of you.

365
00:35:42,661 --> 00:35:47,208
詹姆斯·柯克，舰长和多年的朋友
James Kirk, captain and friend for many years.

366
00:35:47,382 --> 00:35:52,095
还有伦纳德·麦考伊， [大笑] 也认识很久了
And Leonard McCoy. [LAUGHS] Also of long acquaintance.

367
00:35:53,172 --> 00:35:57,134
还有乌乎拉，她名字的意思是自由
And Uhura, whose name means freedom.

368
00:35:57,301 --> 00:36:00,221
<i>她走在美的光彩中，像夜晚</i>
<i>She walks in beauty like the night.</i>

369
00:36:00,387 --> 00:36:04,350
- 那不是史波克  - 你对我读过拜伦感到惊讶吗？
- That's not Spock. - You're surprised I've read Byron?

370
00:36:04,517 --> 00:36:07,186
那是史波克
That's Spock.

371
00:36:07,353 --> 00:36:10,272
我是在向大使讲话吗？
Am I addressing the ambassador?

372
00:36:10,439 --> 00:36:14,485
在某种程度上，我们的一部分被你们称为科洛斯
In part. Part of us is known to you as Kollos.

373
00:36:22,785 --> 00:36:24,870
你在这啊
There you are.

374
00:36:26,205 --> 00:36:30,209
哦，勇敢的新世界，里面有这样的生物
Oh, brave new world, that has such creatures in it.

375
00:36:30,376 --> 00:36:33,045
这对你来说是新鲜的
'Tis new to thee.

376
00:36:36,590 --> 00:36:39,593
我的世界是我们的下一个目标
My world is next for us.

377
00:36:46,183 --> 00:36:51,188
我代表所有美杜莎人讲话，很抱歉给你带来了麻烦
I speak for all of us you call Medusans. Sorry for the trouble I've caused you.

378
00:36:51,397 --> 00:36:55,234
我们没有责怪你，现在感谢您的帮助
We don't hold you to blame. Thank you now for your help.

379
00:36:55,401 --> 00:36:58,237
现在谈谈手头的正事
And now to the business at hand.

380
00:36:58,404 --> 00:37:02,741
- 得到你的许可，舰长  - 让史波克先生掌舵
- With your permission, Captain. - Release the helm to Mr. Spock.

381
00:37:02,908 --> 00:37:04,952
是的，长官
Aye, sir.

382
00:37:21,218 --> 00:37:25,306
- 协调已完成  - 那就出发，史波克先生
- Coordination is completed. - Then go ahead, Mr. Spock.

383
00:37:27,433 --> 00:37:30,269
6秒内达到曲速1
Warp 1 in six seconds.

384
00:37:30,436 --> 00:37:35,566
五四三二一...
Five, four, three, two, one...

385
00:37:35,733 --> 00:37:37,776
零
Zero.

386
00:37:43,115 --> 00:37:45,200
[引擎嗡嗡声]
[ENGINE HUMS]

387
00:38:20,819 --> 00:38:22,947
请位置报告
Position report, please.

388
00:38:23,113 --> 00:38:25,532
我们的位置？
Our position?

389
00:38:28,202 --> 00:38:32,748
我们的位置非常接近我们进入虚空的点
Our position is so close to the point where we entered the void,

390
00:38:32,915 --> 00:38:35,626
差异不值得一提
the difference isn't worth mentioning.

391
00:38:37,252 --> 00:38:40,756
- 正中靶心！  - 谢谢
- Bull's-eye! - Thank you.

392
00:38:40,923 --> 00:38:43,759
- 操作完成  - 苏鲁先生接手
- Maneuver completed. - Take over, Mr. Sulu.

393
00:38:43,926 --> 00:38:48,639
谢谢大使， 契科夫先生，绘制一条新航线
Thank you, Ambassador. Mr. Chekov, plot a new course.

394
00:38:48,806 --> 00:38:52,017
新航向将在一分钟内绘制完毕
New headings will be plotted in a minute.

395
00:38:58,065 --> 00:39:00,609
你们的躯体多么结实啊
How compact your bodies are.

396
00:39:02,069 --> 00:39:05,114
你们有多么多样的感官
What a variety of senses you have.

397
00:39:06,198 --> 00:39:09,660
不过，你们称之为语言的东西
This thing you call language, though.

398
00:39:09,827 --> 00:39:15,207
最了不起，你们非常依赖它
Most remarkable. You depend on it for so very much.

399
00:39:16,333 --> 00:39:19,169
但是你们当中有人真的是它的主人吗？
But is any one of you really its master?

400
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:25,384
但最重要的是，孤独感
But most of all, the aloneness.

401
00:39:27,344 --> 00:39:29,471
你们是如此孤独
You are so alone.

402
00:39:30,514 --> 00:39:35,853
你们在这个……肉体中度过你的一生
You live out your lives in this... shell of flesh.

403
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:40,315
独立的，分开的
Self-contained. Separate.

404
00:39:42,234 --> 00:39:44,987
你们是多么的孤独啊
How lonely you are.

405
00:39:46,071 --> 00:39:48,073
多么的孤独
How terribly lonely.

406
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:49,825
大使？
Ambassador?

407
00:39:55,539 --> 00:39:58,417
您必须解除连接
You must dissolve the link.

408
00:39:59,626 --> 00:40:01,795
这么快？
So soon?

409
00:40:04,256 --> 00:40:06,884
绝不能拖延
There must be no delay.

410
00:40:08,635 --> 00:40:11,180
你是个明智的舰长
You're a wise captain.

411
00:40:39,249 --> 00:40:42,961
史波克！别看！捂住眼睛！
Spock! Don't look! Cover your eyes!

412
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:58,185
[史波克大喊]
[SPOCK SHOUTS]

413
00:41:01,814 --> 00:41:04,900
- 别动，所有人都别动  - 吉姆
- Don't move. No one is to move. - Jim.

414
00:41:09,696 --> 00:41:11,406
史波克？
Spock?

415
00:41:11,573 --> 00:41:13,659
你没事吧？
Are you all right?

416
00:41:35,264 --> 00:41:36,640
史波克？
Spock?

417
00:41:37,808 --> 00:41:42,521
没事了，你现在和我们在一起很安全
It's all right. You're safe with us now.

418
00:42:13,010 --> 00:42:16,430
他几乎没有呼吸，帮我把他送到医务室
He's hardly breathing. Help me get him to Sickbay.

419
00:42:23,437 --> 00:42:28,609
除非米兰达能洞察他的想法并将其转达给我们，否则我们将失去史波克
Unless Miranda can look into his mind and turn it to us, we'll lose Spock.

420
00:42:28,775 --> 00:42:34,531
瓦肯人的心智技术显得如此不可信，现在他的生命受到威胁
Vulcan mind techniques seem so untrustworthy now his life is at stake.

421
00:42:34,698 --> 00:42:37,576
她对他们的了解是唯一可以拯救他的理智
Her knowledge of them is the only thing that could save his sanity,

422
00:42:37,743 --> 00:42:40,037
或生命的东西
or his life.

423
00:42:40,204 --> 00:42:42,247
但她愿意吗？
But does she want to?

424
00:42:44,541 --> 00:42:48,837
- 她在那里待了这么久  - 没别的办法了
- She's been in there so long. - There's nothing else to be done.

425
00:42:49,004 --> 00:42:53,967
- 她试图帮助马维克，结果他死了  - 那不一样，他爱她
- She tried to help Marvick. He's dead. - That's different. He loved her.

426
00:42:54,134 --> 00:42:57,930
而史波克是她的对手，这有什么好处吗？
And Spock is her rival. Is that any better?

427
00:42:58,096 --> 00:43:00,891
史波克感受到了她嫉妒的暴力
Spock felt the violence of her jealousy.

428
00:43:01,058 --> 00:43:03,060
他们不是情敌
They weren't rivals in love.

429
00:43:05,103 --> 00:43:07,356
吉姆...
Jim...

430
00:43:08,607 --> 00:43:13,362
- 你不应该进去  - 无论发生什么，都不要干涉
- You shouldn't go in there. - Whatever happens, don't interfere.

431
00:43:21,745 --> 00:43:24,873
是谁？麦考伊博士？
Who is it? Dr. McCoy?

432
00:43:28,335 --> 00:43:30,420
谁在那儿？
Who's there?

433
00:43:35,425 --> 00:43:37,803
柯克舰长
Captain Kirk.

434
00:43:39,638 --> 00:43:42,391
我没有消息要告诉你，舰长
I have no news for you, Captain.

435
00:43:44,685 --> 00:43:46,728
没变化？
No change?

436
00:43:46,895 --> 00:43:50,816
只知道他的生命过程正在衰退
Only that his life processes are ebbing.

437
00:43:50,983 --> 00:43:54,278
- 你在做什么？ - 当然是我能做的
- What are you doing about it? - What I can, of course.

438
00:43:54,444 --> 00:43:57,197
然而似乎并不多
Which doesn't seem to be much.

439
00:43:57,364 --> 00:44:00,325
你觉得我可以用一个吻唤醒他吗？
You think I can wake him with a kiss?

440
00:44:00,492 --> 00:44:03,203
值得一试，他不是机器
Worth a try. He's not a machine.

441
00:44:03,370 --> 00:44:04,579
但他是瓦肯人
But he is a Vulcan.

442
00:44:04,746 --> 00:44:08,125
半人，显然比你多
Half human. More than you, apparently.

443
00:44:08,417 --> 00:44:11,253
面对现实吧，舰长
Face reality, Captain.

444
00:44:11,545 --> 00:44:15,090
他的思维已经微弱到连我都几乎难以触及了
His mind has gone down almost too far even for me to reach.

445
00:44:15,257 --> 00:44:18,969
如果你不尽快找到他，他就会死
If you don't reach him soon, he'll die.

446
00:44:19,970 --> 00:44:23,265
- 但这就是你想要的，不是吗？ - 才不是
- But that's what you want, isn't it? - That's a lie.

447
00:44:23,432 --> 00:44:27,894
你想让他死，你让他忘记戴面罩了吗？
You want him to die. Did you make him forget to put on his visor?

448
00:44:28,061 --> 00:44:31,231
- 你疯了  - 你了解你的对手，不是吗？
- You're insane. - You know your rival, don't you?

449
00:44:31,481 --> 00:44:36,320
你不能阻止他建立你做不到的心灵连接
You couldn't keep him from making a mind-link, something you couldn't do.

450
00:44:37,195 --> 00:44:42,284
用我的话说，我会让你听到那样的丑陋
With my words, I'll make you hear such ugliness.

451
00:44:42,451 --> 00:44:46,663
史波克用他的肉眼看到的丑陋……丑陋在你的心中
What Spock saw with his naked eyes... The ugliness is within you.

452
00:44:46,830 --> 00:44:50,792
- 不是的！骗子！  - 你想见科洛斯的愿望是疯狂的
- That's a lie! Liar! - Your desire to see Kollos is madness.

453
00:44:50,959 --> 00:44:53,587
你永远都见不到他，永远！
You can never see him, never!

454
00:44:53,754 --> 00:44:58,633
但是史波克看到了科洛斯，为此，他必须死
But Spock saw Kollos. And for that, he must die.

455
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:01,678
虐待狂，肮脏的骗子！
Sadistic, filthy liar!

456
00:45:01,845 --> 00:45:05,849
嫉妒的恶臭弥漫在你身上，你为什么不掐死他？
The stench of jealousy permeates you. Why don't you strangle him?

457
00:45:06,016 --> 00:45:09,394
- 别再说了！ - 科洛斯知道你内心的想法
- Don't say any more! - Kollos knows what's in your heart.

458
00:45:09,561 --> 00:45:13,857
- 你可以骗自己，但不能骗他  - 请走开
- You can lie to yourself but not to him. - Please go away.

459
00:45:28,997 --> 00:45:32,084
- 你对她说了什么？ - 也许太多了
- What did you say to her? - Maybe too much.

460
00:45:32,250 --> 00:45:36,505
- 她在里面做什么？ - 也许我不应该进去
- What's she doing in there? - Maybe I shouldn't have gone in.

461
00:45:36,671 --> 00:45:41,176
她是瞎子，真的很瞎，真的处于黑暗中
She was blind, really blind, really in the dark.

462
00:45:41,343 --> 00:45:47,724
如果他死了，我怎么知道我没有杀了他？
And if he dies, how do I know that I didn't kill him?

463
00:45:47,891 --> 00:45:51,061
我怎么知道她能忍受听到真相？
How do I know that she can stand to hear the truth?

464
00:46:02,364 --> 00:46:05,909
现在，史波克，这对我们俩来说
Now, Spock. This is to the death,

465
00:46:06,159 --> 00:46:09,079
都是死亡，或者说是生命
or to life for both of us.

466
00:47:19,191 --> 00:47:22,861
你看起来像是拜访了魔鬼本人
You look like you've paid a visit to the devil himself.

467
00:47:43,256 --> 00:47:47,344
- 你有你最想要的东西吗？ - 我和科洛斯是一体的
- You have what you wanted most? - I am at one with Kollos.

468
00:47:47,510 --> 00:47:51,514
真遗憾你要走了，再见
I'm truly sorry that you're leaving. Goodbye.

469
00:47:55,894 --> 00:47:59,022
我们结束了一次多事的旅行，舰长
We come to the end of an eventful trip, Captain.

470
00:47:59,189 --> 00:48:04,611
- 我没想到你会跟我说话  - 为了我的未来，我要感谢你
- I didn't think you'd talk to me. - I have you to thank for my future.

471
00:48:04,903 --> 00:48:07,447
你的话让我能够看到了
Your words enabled me to see.

472
00:48:07,614 --> 00:48:13,036
米兰达，祝你好运，健康，我有东西给你
Miranda, good luck. Health. I have something for you.

473
00:48:16,873 --> 00:48:19,000
我猜它有刺
I suppose it has thorns.

474
00:48:19,167 --> 00:48:22,254
我从没遇到过没有刺的玫瑰
I never met a rose that didn't.

475
00:48:32,264 --> 00:48:37,102
我现在知道你和科洛斯的心灵连接时所感受到的巨大喜悦了
I know now the great joy you felt when you joined minds with Kollos.

476
00:48:37,269 --> 00:48:40,855
我为你的知识和成就感到高兴
I rejoice in your knowledge and in your achievement.

477
00:48:42,691 --> 00:48:45,110
我明白，史波克先生
I understand, Mr. Spock.

478
00:48:45,277 --> 00:48:49,114
创造的繁荣在于其无限的多样性
The glory of creation is in its infinite diversity.

479
00:48:49,281 --> 00:48:54,828
以及我们的差异相结合来创造意义和美的方式
And the ways our differences combine to create meaning and beauty.

480
00:49:04,671 --> 00:49:09,301
- 安居乐业，长盛不衰，史波克  - 生生不息，繁荣昌盛，米兰达
- Peace and long life, Spock. - Live long and prosper, Miranda.

481
00:49:14,139 --> 00:49:16,182
安居乐业
Peace.
