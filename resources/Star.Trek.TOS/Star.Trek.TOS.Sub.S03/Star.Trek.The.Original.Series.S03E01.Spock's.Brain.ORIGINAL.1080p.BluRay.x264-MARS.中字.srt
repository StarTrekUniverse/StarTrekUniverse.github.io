- Well, Scotty? - Beats me, but isn't she a beauty?

10
00:01:22,186 --> 00:01:27,025
- 有趣的设计 - 还有离子推进器
- Interesting design. - And ion propulsion, at that.

11
00:01:27,191 --> 00:01:29,485
他们可以教我们一两招

12
00:01:29,652 --> 00:01:33,698
- 生命体呢，史波克先生? - 有一个。人形或类似的
- Life-forms, Mr. Spock? - One. Humanoid or similar.

19
00:03:14,632 --> 00:03:17,635
柯克：<i>宇宙，最后的边疆</i>

<i>它的五年任务：探索未知的新世界，</i>

22
00:03:32,233 --> 00:03:35,903
<i>寻找新的生命和新的文明，<i>

23
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:39,407
<i>勇敢地航向前人未至之境。</i>
<i>to boldly go where no man has gone before.</i>

24
00:04:39,717 --> 00:04:42,470

00:05:19,924 --> 00:05:22,426
- 史波克。怎么了？- 我发现他躺在手术台上
- Spock. What happened? - I found him on the table. 

34
00:05:22,593 --> 00:05:24,679
- 像这样？- 不，不是这样
- Like this? - No, not like this.

35
00:05:25,763 --> 00:05:29,225
发生什么了？- 我不知道
- What happened? - I don't know.

36
00:05:32,812 --> 00:05:35,398
你给他用上了完整的生命维持系统。他死了吗？
You've got him on complete life-support. Was he dead?

37
00:05:36,565 --> 00:05:37,984
他比死还糟糕
He was worse than dead.

38
00:05:39,402 --> 00:05:41,612
- 你什么意思？- 吉姆...
- What do you mean? - Jim...

39
00:05:41,779 --> 00:05:44,365
说吧。有什么神秘的？
Come on. What's the mystery?

40
00:05:44,532 --> 00:05:48,577
- 他的大脑不见了 - 他的大脑？
- His brain is gone. - His brain?

41
00:05:49,954 --> 00:05:51,914
它被手术切除了
It's been removed surgically.

42
00:05:57,837 --> 00:06:02,717
- 他是怎么活下来的？- 这是我见过的最好的技术活儿
- How could he survive? - It's the best technical job I've seen.

43
00:06:02,967 --> 00:06:07,888
每个神经末梢都被整齐地封住。没有撕裂，也没有扯断。
Every nerve ending was neatly sealed. Nothing ripped, nothing torn.

44
00:06:08,055 --> 00:06:11,142
没有出血。简直是医学奇迹
No bleeding. It's a medical miracle.

45
00:06:11,309 --> 00:06:15,104
如果大脑不见了，那么史波克就快死了
If the brain is missing, then Spock is dying.

46
00:06:15,271 --> 00:06:17,273
没有
No.

47
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:22,570
那令人难以置信的瓦肯人的体格一直坚持到生命维持系统接手
That incredible Vulcan physique hung on till the life-support cycle took over.

48
00:06:22,737 --> 00:06:26,365
他的身体活着。自助功能还在继续
His body lives. The autonomic functions continue.

49
00:06:28,451 --> 00:06:30,745
但没有思维
But there is no mind.

50
00:06:39,712 --> 00:06:42,298
- 那个女孩 - 是的
- That girl. - Aye.

51
00:06:42,715 --> 00:06:46,260
- 什么女孩？- 那艘船上的
- What girl? - From that ship.

52
00:06:46,886 --> 00:06:48,721
她拿走了
She took it.

53
00:06:49,347 --> 00:06:54,643
我不知道为什么，或在哪里，但她一定把它拿走了
I don't know why, or where, but she must have taken it.

54
00:06:55,978 --> 00:06:58,856
老骨头，你能让他维持多久？
Bones, how long can you keep him functioning?

55
00:06:59,023 --> 00:07:01,984
- 我不能保证 - 那还不够
- I can't guarantee. - That's not good enough.

56
00:07:02,151 --> 00:07:04,695
如果这种事情发生在我们任何一个人身上，我会说是无限期的。
If it happened to any of us, I would say indefinitely.

57
00:07:04,862 --> 00:07:07,948
但是瓦肯人的生理学限制了我能做的
But Vulcan physiology limits what I can do.

58
00:07:08,115 --> 00:07:12,620
史波克的身体依靠那个巨大的大脑维持生命
Spock's body is dependent on that tremendous brain for life-support.

59
00:07:13,871 --> 00:07:15,998
那我们就得带上他
Then we'll have to take him with us.

60
00:07:16,791 --> 00:07:21,253
- 带他去哪儿？- 找他的大脑，医生
- Take him where? - In search of his brain, Doctor.

61
00:07:23,506 --> 00:07:27,593
照你说的，一旦我们找到大脑，必须把它装回他的身体
From what you say, the moment we find it we must restore it to his body.

62
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:30,096
吉姆
Jim.

63
00:07:31,055 --> 00:07:33,641
你打算去哪儿找？
Where are you going to look?

64
00:07:33,808 --> 00:07:39,897
在这整个星系里，你打算去哪儿找史波克的大脑？
In this whole galaxy, where are you going to look for Spock's brain?

65
00:07:40,064 --> 00:07:42,316
你打算怎么找到它？
How are you going to find it?

66
00:07:43,401 --> 00:07:47,488
- 我会找到的 - 就算你找到了，我也没法修复
- I'll find it. - Even if you do, I can't restore it.

67
00:07:47,655 --> 00:07:50,199
我没有这样的医学技术
I don't have the medical technique.

68
00:07:50,366 --> 00:07:54,245
它被拿走了，它就可以放回去
It was taken out. It can be put back in.

69
00:07:54,412 --> 00:07:56,497
但我不知道怎么做
But I don't know how.

70
00:07:57,415 --> 00:08:02,002
偷它的贼知道，我会逼她说出来
The thief that took it has the knowledge. I'll force it out of her.

71
00:08:02,169 --> 00:08:06,424
如果没能在24小时内找到，你最好忘记整件事
If you don't find it in 24 hours, you'd better forget the whole thing.

72
00:08:10,511 --> 00:08:15,724
你和斯科提。让史波克准备好
You and Scotty. Have Spock ready.

73
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:25,943
我又找到了。她那艘飞船的离子轨迹
I've got it again. An ion trail from that ship of hers.

74
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:30,614
- 轨迹通向哪儿？- 西格玛龙系
- Where does the trail lead? - System Sigma Draconis.

75
00:08:31,574 --> 00:08:35,995
- 最大速度 - 曲速6
- Maximum speed. - Warp 6.

76
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:44,295
- 轨迹没有错误吧？ - 没问题，长官
- No question about the trail? - No mistake, sir.

77
00:08:59,143 --> 00:09:02,605
柯克：<i>舰长日志，星历5431.4</i>
KIRK: <i>Captain's log, stardate 5431.4.</i>

78
00:09:02,771 --> 00:09:08,944
<i>我们已经跟踪那艘载有史波克大脑的飞船15小时20分钟了</i>
<i>For 15 hours and 20 minutes, we have followed the ship that has Spock's brain.</i>

79
00:09:09,111 --> 00:09:12,031
<i>留给我们的时间还有：8小时40分钟</i>
<i>Time left to us: eight hours and 40 minutes.</i>

80
00:09:12,198 --> 00:09:15,242
- 我跟丢了 - 所有扫描仪，极限搜查
- I've lost the trail. - All scanners, extreme sweep.

81
00:09:15,659 --> 00:09:17,286
是，长官
Aye, sir.

82
00:09:21,624 --> 00:09:24,877
- 怎么样？ - 完全没信号，舰长
- Well? - No signal at all, Captain.

83
00:09:25,544 --> 00:09:30,466
- 它不见了，突然消失了 -我们跟丢了。
- It's gone. A sudden deaction shift. - We've lost her trail.

84
00:09:30,633 --> 00:09:32,176
但她进入了那个星系
But she went into that system.

85
00:09:32,885 --> 00:09:35,971
把西格玛龙系的示意图放在屏幕上。
Put a schematic of Sigma Draconis on the screen.

86
00:09:36,388 --> 00:09:38,224
是，舰长
Aye, Captain.

87
00:09:39,266 --> 00:09:41,435
解读一下，契科夫先生
Read-out, Mr. Chekov?

88
00:09:41,977 --> 00:09:45,856
恒星，光谱类型，伽马9，有九个行星。
Sun, spectral type, Gamma 9, nine planets.

89
00:09:46,023 --> 00:09:52,321
据报告其中三个为M级，拥有智慧生命。
Three of them Class-M, possessing sapient life according to reports.

90
00:09:52,488 --> 00:09:57,576
她呼吸我们的空气，她一定在其中一个上
She was breathing our air. She must have gone to one of them.

91
00:09:57,743 --> 00:10:00,246
给我们看三颗M级行星，契科夫先生
Show us the three Class-M planets, Mr. Chekov.

92
00:10:07,002 --> 00:10:11,799
左边的那个，编号为三，在工业规模评级为B。
The one on the left, number III, rates letter B on the industrial scale.

93
00:10:11,966 --> 00:10:15,219
相当1485年的地球
Earth equivalent, approximately 1485.

94
00:10:15,386 --> 00:10:21,058
是的，长官。第二颗，M级，编号四，评级为G
Yes, sir. Second planet, Class-M, number IV, rates letter G.

95
00:10:21,225 --> 00:10:23,561
2030年
The year 2030.

96
00:10:23,727 --> 00:10:29,233
那艘船要么领先我们很多年，要么侥幸有不可思议的设计。
That ship was many years ahead of us or the most incredible design fluke.

97
00:10:29,775 --> 00:10:34,446
- 第三颗M级行星呢？- 编号六。没有工业发展
- Third Class-M planet? - Number VI. No industrial development.

98
00:10:34,613 --> 00:10:40,202
最后报告，，处于冰川时代。智慧生命很多，但处于最原始的水平
Last report, in a glacial age. Sapient life plentiful, but on a most primitive level.

99
00:10:40,369 --> 00:10:43,622
据我所知，这三颗M级行星
As I understand it, there are three Class-M planets.

100
00:10:43,789 --> 00:10:48,252
都没有能力发射星际飞行器，然而有一个做到了
Not one is capable of launching an interstellar flight, yet one did.

101
00:10:48,419 --> 00:10:50,588
- 是的，长官 - 谢谢
- Yes, sir. - Thank you.

102
00:10:50,754 --> 00:10:54,258
我在六号行星上发现了高能量的产生
I'm picking up high energy generation on planet VI.

103
00:10:54,425 --> 00:10:57,845
那是原始的冰川行星。能量源？
That's the primitive glaciated planet. The source?

104
00:10:58,012 --> 00:11:02,433
它可能是自然现象。火山活动，蒸汽，各种原因
It could be natural. Volcanic activity, steam, any number of causes.

105
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:05,603
- 它是有规律的 - 地表读数显示什么？
- It's regular. - What do surface readings show?

106
00:11:05,769 --> 00:11:10,649
没有组织的文明。不规则间隔的原始人形生物
No organized civilization. Primitive humanoids at irregular intervals.

107
00:11:10,816 --> 00:11:15,154
- 生成能量的脉冲？ - 我无法解释，长官
- Pulsations of generated energy? - I can't explain it, sir.

108
00:11:18,907 --> 00:11:21,285
我不能猜错
I can't afford to guess wrong.

109
00:11:21,452 --> 00:11:24,788
最好选择正确的星球，到那儿找到大脑
Better choose the right planet, get there, find the brain.

110
00:11:24,955 --> 00:11:26,957
8小时35分钟
Eight hours and 35 minutes.

111
00:11:27,124 --> 00:11:30,252
- 建议？ - 西格玛龙系三号
- Recommendations? - Sigma Draconis III.

112
00:11:30,419 --> 00:11:34,465
- 它最近，人口最多 - 但技术评级是3
- It's closest, heaviest population. - But a technological rating of 3.

113
00:11:34,632 --> 00:11:38,510
- 它不能把飞船送入太空 - 这些星球都不能
- It couldn't put that ship into space. - None of these planets could.

114
00:11:41,889 --> 00:11:46,352
要我说是四号行星。技术上它领先于三号行星
I say planet IV. It's ahead of planet III technologically.

115
00:11:46,518 --> 00:11:51,482
但先进的离子推进器甚至超过了我们的能力
But advanced ion propulsion beyond even our capabilities.

116
00:11:51,649 --> 00:11:58,113
他们要 史波克 先生的大脑干什么? 有什么用？
What would they want with Mr. Spock's brain? What use is it?

117
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:03,243
- 他们为什么要它？ - 是啊，他们为什么想要它呢？
- Why do they want it? - Yes, why would they want it?

118
00:12:03,661 --> 00:12:06,372
8小时34分钟
Eight hours and 34 minutes.

119
00:12:06,538 --> 00:12:08,457
你说，六号行星是冰川化的？
Planet VI is glaciated, you say?

120
00:12:08,624 --> 00:12:13,003
至少几千年了。只有热带地区是无冰的
For several thousand years at least. Only the tropical zone is ice-free.

121
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:17,383
但是能量。有规律。就是那儿
But the energy. Regular. It's there.

122
00:12:17,549 --> 00:12:21,887
- 真的 - 这说不通，但它就在那儿
- It's real. - It doesn't make sense, but it's there.

123
00:12:25,724 --> 00:12:29,687
传送室，待命。我要带一支登陆小队去六号行星
Transporter room, stand by. I'm taking a landing party to Planet VI.

124
00:12:29,853 --> 00:12:31,271
好的，长官
Aye, aye, sir.

125
00:12:31,438 --> 00:12:33,524
直觉，舰长？
A hunch, Captain?

126
00:12:34,483 --> 00:12:35,776
直觉，苏鲁先生
A hunch, Mr. Sulu.

127
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:40,197
但如果你猜错了呢，舰长？
But if you guess wrong, Captain?

128
00:12:40,364 --> 00:12:43,117
如果我猜错了，史波克先生就死了
If I guess wrong, Mr. Spock is dead.

129
00:12:44,034 --> 00:12:45,869
史波克会死
Spock will die.

读数？
Read-out?

138
00:13:42,259 --> 00:13:45,471
没有建筑物，没有我能读到的机械物体

等我信号开火
Fire only on my signal.

147

152

你们... 不是其他人吗？
You... are not the others?

153
00:15:55,183 --> 00:15:59,229
不，我们来自遥远的地方
No. We come from a far place.

154
00:15:59,479 --> 00:16:01,315
我们是人
We are men.

155
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:04,234

- Men? - Like yourselves.

156
00:16:05,235 --> 00:16:10,157
你们很小，就像其他人一样

00:16:10,574 --> 00:16:14,786
- 谁是其他人？- 痛苦给予者

00:16:15,912 --> 00:16:17,831
和喜悦

他们和你一起生活在这儿吗？

00:16:21,627 --> 00:16:26,048
不，他们会来。给予痛苦和喜悦

他们也是冲着你们的女人来的吗？

167
00:16:47,569 --> 00:16:50,697
你的话说不通

168
00:16:52,699 --> 00:16:54,034

172
00:17:13,303 --> 00:17:17,933
舰长，那个方向500米有个地下基地
Captain. 500 meters in that direction is a foundation under the surface.

173
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:21,019
- 到处都是标记 - 建筑物呢？
- The registration's all over the place. - Buildings?

174
00:17:21,186 --> 00:17:26,817
被埋了，但它们曾经在这儿 - 那下面是其他人住的地方
- Buried, but they were here once. - Down there is where the others live.

175
00:17:26,983 --> 00:17:30,445
- 看看能不能找到下去的路 - 不！
- See if you can find a way down. - No!

176
00:17:30,612 --> 00:17:33,990
- 别去那！别！别！ - 没事的

177
00:17:34,658 --> 00:17:36,535
没关系。让他走
It's all right. Let him go.

178
00:17:37,911 --> 00:17:41,915
- 他们做了什么让你如此恐惧?-他说了什么? 痛苦和喜悦？
- What do they do to cause such terror? - What did he say? Pain and delight?

179
00:17:42,082 --> 00:17:47,045
- 奇怪的混合体 - 一个死亡的被埋葬的城市
- Peculiar mixture. - A dead and buried city

180
00:17:47,295 --> 00:17:50,048
在一个冰川时代的行星上

00:17:50,215 --> 00:17:54,136
不知道“女性”这个词意思的男性人形生物
The male humanoid who doesn't know the meaning of the word "female".

182
00:17:54,302 --> 00:17:56,012
斯科提：舰长！
SCOTTY: Captain!

183
00:17:58,181 --> 00:18:00,142
过来这里，长官
Over here, sir.

184
00:18:02,477 --> 00:18:07,816
里面有食物和其他东西，是我们肌肉发达的朋友的仓库
There's food in there and other stuff. A storehouse for our muscular friends.

185
00:18:07,983 --> 00:18:10,736
我不那么认为，斯科提
I don't think so. Scotty.

186
00:18:16,116 --> 00:18:18,702
金属，锻造过，回火过
Metal, forged. Tempered.

187
00:18:18,869 --> 00:18:22,038
这些不是我们的“聪明”朋友做的
Our apish friends didn't make these.

188
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:24,249
你怎么看？
What do you think?

189
00:18:24,416 --> 00:18:28,170
可能是为了让那些生物远离食物
It could be to keep those creatures away from the food.

190
00:18:28,336 --> 00:18:32,507
或者食物可能是其他人为了吸引他们来这里设下的诱饵
Or the food could be a lure set by the others to bring them here.

191
00:18:32,674 --> 00:18:37,262
- 那么光束可能是个信号 - 这个洞穴就是个陷阱
- Then the beam would be a signal. - And this cave a trap.

192
00:18:37,429 --> 00:18:41,349
如果它给其他人捕捉生物，它不也会捕捉我们吗？
If it traps the creatures for the others, won't it trap us too?

193
00:18:41,516 --> 00:18:43,059
没错
Exactly.

194
00:18:45,061 --> 00:18:47,105
- 柯克呼叫<i>企业号</i> - 企业号，<i>我是乌乎拉</i>

立刻把麦考伊传送下来

00:18:50,567 --> 00:18:55,655
你和警卫留在这里，我们会保持联系。
You and the security team will remain here. We'll be in constant contact.

197
00:18:55,822 --> 00:18:57,491
是，长官
Aye, sir.

198
00:19:19,095 --> 00:19:22,808
好的，老骨头。带上他
All right, Bones. Bring him along.

199
00:19:43,036 --> 00:19:45,163
让他走在右边
Keep him close to the right.

200
00:19:50,377 --> 00:19:51,962
准备好了？
Ready?

201
00:19:54,631 --> 00:19:56,591
[当当响]

202
00:19:57,509 --> 00:20:01,471
呼叫 契科夫让他把我的胃送下来
Call Chekov and tell him to send my stomach down.

203
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:08,895
可能要等很久。我们不妨舒服一点。
It might be a long wait. We may as well be comfortable.

204
00:20:24,536 --> 00:20:26,830
相位枪击晕模式
Phasers on stun.

205
00:20:28,331 --> 00:20:31,418
在上面接收到的能量离我们越来越近了
That power we picked up above. We're getting closer.

206
00:20:31,585 --> 00:20:34,629
- 很多？ - 足够把这颗行星推出轨道
- A lot of it? - Enough to push the planet out of orbit.

207
00:20:34,796 --> 00:20:40,510
- 来源？ - 直径100英里的核反应堆，或者...
- What source? - A nuclear pile 100 miles across, or...

208
00:20:40,677 --> 00:20:43,805
- 或者什么？ - 离子能
- Or what? - Ion power.

209
00:20:49,352 --> 00:20:51,313
我们在减速
We're slowing down.

210
00:21:29,684 --> 00:21:32,771
- 她还好吗？ - 我马上让她开口
- Is she all right? - I'll have her talking in a minute.

211
00:21:35,565 --> 00:21:38,568
你不属于这里，你不是莫格人
You do not belong here. You are not Morg.

212
00:21:38,735 --> 00:21:42,822
- 负责人呢，带我去见他 - 他？什么是他？
- The one in charge, take me to him. - Him? What is him?

213
00:21:42,989 --> 00:21:46,326
你把史波克的大脑怎么了？它在哪儿？
What have you done with Spock's brain? Where is it?

214
00:21:46,493 --> 00:21:50,413
你不是莫格或伊莫格人。我不知道什么大脑
You are not Morg or Eymorg. I know nothing about a brain.

215
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:53,458
- 你说谎 - 她没有。读数没有变化
- You're lying. - She's not. No change in reading.

216
00:21:53,625 --> 00:21:55,752
她不知道
She doesn't know.

217
00:22:02,968 --> 00:22:05,679
看看你的通讯器能接收到什么信息
See what you can pick up on your communicator.

218
00:22:07,305 --> 00:22:09,182
我们不想伤害你
We don't want to hurt you.

219
00:22:10,767 --> 00:22:12,602
这是什么地方？
What is this place?

220
00:22:12,769 --> 00:22:15,689
这个地方就是这里
This place is here.

221
00:22:16,272 --> 00:22:20,443
- 你是谁？ - 我是卢玛。我是伊莫格人
- Who are you? - I am Luma. I am Eymorg.

222
00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:23,655
你不是伊莫格人。你也不是莫格人
You are not Eymorg. You are not Morg.

223
00:22:23,822 --> 00:22:24,864
你是什么？
What are you?

224
00:22:27,784 --> 00:22:29,244
吉姆
Jim.

225
00:22:29,786 --> 00:22:35,000
你从她那儿了解不到信息。这是一个孩子的思维
You'll get nothing out of that one. Hers is the mind of a child.

226
00:22:35,166 --> 00:22:39,337
我有一些头绪，但我无法完全理清它。
I've got something but I can't quite get a fix on it.

227
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:46,845
史波克[通过广播]：<i>真有意思，活动没有尽头，但也没有意志</i>
SPOCK [OVER RADIO]: <i>Fascinating. Activity without end, but with no volition.</i>

00:22:47,012 --> 00:22:49,889
- 史波克，是你吗？ - <i>柯克舰长？</i>
- Spock, is that you? - <i>Captain Kirk?</i>

229
00:22:52,308 --> 00:22:55,061
是的，史波克
Yes, Spock.

230
00:22:56,312 --> 00:23:02,110
<i>您的声音绝对令人愉悦</i>
<i>There is a definite pleasurable experience connected with your voice.</i>

231
00:23:02,277 --> 00:23:06,281
- 你在哪儿？- <i>麦考伊医生，你和舰长在一起吗？</i>
- Where are you? - <i>Dr. McCoy, are you with the captain?</i>

232
00:23:06,448 --> 00:23:09,617
- 我还能去哪儿? - 史波克，你在哪儿？
- Where else would I be? - Spock, where are you?

233
00:23:09,784 --> 00:23:14,330
<i>还有史考特工程师? 不幸的是，我不知道我在哪里</i>
<i>Engineer Scott as well? Unfortunately, I do not know where I am.</i>

234
00:23:14,497 --> 00:23:17,625
我们会找到你的，不会很久的
We'll get to you. It won't be long.

235
00:23:17,792 --> 00:23:22,630
<i>可行的想法。看来我不太可能找到你了</i>
<i>Practical idea. It seems unlikely that I shall be able to get to you.</i>

236
00:23:22,797 --> 00:23:24,257
快点
Quickly.

237
00:23:30,847 --> 00:23:35,560
她在这里。就是她。你对史波克的大脑做了什么？
There she is. That's the one. What have you done with Spock's brain?

238
00:24:06,424 --> 00:24:09,677
柯克：<i>舰长日志，星历5431.5</i>
KIRK: <i>Captain's log, stardate 5431.6.</i>

239
00:24:09,844 --> 00:24:12,305
<i>在与史波克的大脑接触后</i>
<i>After making contact with Spock's brain,</i>

240
00:24:12,472 --> 00:24:18,812
<i>麦考伊，斯科特和我被囚禁在一个高度复杂的文明中</i>
<i>McCoy, Scott and myself were taken prisoner in a highly complex civilization</i>

241
00:24:18,978 --> 00:24:23,733
<i>在西格玛龙系六号行星的地下几百米处</i>
<i>hundreds of meters below the surface of planet Sigma Draconis VII.</i>

242
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:26,444
<i>上面的原始生物<i>

243
00:24:26,611 --> 00:24:29,447
<i>警告过我们关于痛苦和喜悦给予者</i>

244
00:24:29,614 --> 00:24:34,035
<i>以及被他们俘虏的可怕后果。</i>
<i>and the frightening consequences of being captured by them.</i>

245
00:24:57,475 --> 00:25:01,646
你是什么？你为什么在这里？
What are you? Why are you here?

246
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,151
你有话要说吗？
You have something to speak?

247
00:25:12,323 --> 00:25:15,577
- -史波克的大脑在哪儿？ - 我们不认识史波克
- Where is Spock's brain? - We do not know Spock.

248
00:25:15,743 --> 00:25:21,708
这是史波克，你在飞船上见过他，你拿了他的大脑
This is Spock. You saw him on the ship. You have his brain.

249
00:25:21,875 --> 00:25:25,295
必须给他装回去。你把它怎么了？
It must be restored to him. What have you done with it?

250
00:25:25,461 --> 00:25:28,715
你和卢玛说了大脑的事，但我们不明白。
You spoke to Luma of brain but we do not understand.

251
00:25:28,882 --> 00:25:33,469
我不认识卢玛，但我在<i>企业号</i>上见过你
I do not know about Luma, but you were on the <i>Enterprise.</i> I saw you.

252
00:25:33,636 --> 00:25:37,473
- 我们不知道这些事... - 你来到我的船上
- We do not know these things... - You came to my ship.

253
00:25:38,141 --> 00:25:41,978
我们只知道下面这里和上面这里。这是我们的地方
We know only here below and here above. This is our place.

254
00:25:42,145 --> 00:25:46,649
- 你不是莫格人， 你是陌生人 - 我在我的船上见过你
- You are not Morg. You are stranger. - I saw you on my ship.

255
00:25:46,816 --> 00:25:48,359
吉姆
Jim.

256
00:25:52,822 --> 00:25:58,369
她可能不记得或者真的不知道，分离可能是完全的。
She may not remember or really know. Disassociation could be complete.

257
00:25:58,536 --> 00:26:02,665
看起来她似乎不可能给史波克做手术。
It doesn't seem possible she could perform surgery on Spock.

258
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,586
- 是的，不可能 - 你伤害了卢玛
- No, it doesn't. - You hurt Luma.

259
00:26:06,753 --> 00:26:09,047
不允许再伤害任何人。
It is not permitted again to hurt anyone.

260
00:26:10,381 --> 00:26:14,510
对不起，我们不想伤害任何人。
Sorry. We don't want to hurt anyone.

261
00:26:14,969 --> 00:26:19,015
如果你想回家，你可以走了。
If you wish to return to your home, you may go.

262
00:26:21,142 --> 00:26:26,731
不，我们要留在这里了解你
No. We'll stay here and learn about you

263
00:26:26,898 --> 00:26:29,025
告诉你我们的故事。
and tell you of us.

264
00:26:31,361 --> 00:26:36,032
是的。比如说，上面是寒冷刺骨的。
Yes. For instance, above it's cold and harsh.

265
00:26:36,199 --> 00:26:40,745
下面是温暖的，空气清新。
And below, it's warm. The air is fresh.

266
00:26:40,912 --> 00:26:44,249
是的，没有太阳，但有光。
Aye. There's no sun but there's light.

267
00:26:47,043 --> 00:26:52,048
我想和负责人谈谈。组织者，管理人员
I wish to talk to those in charge. The organizers, the managers.

268
00:26:52,215 --> 00:26:57,262
- 你们人民的领袖 - 我就是领袖，没有其他人了。
- The leader of your people. - I am leader. There is no other.

269
00:26:57,428 --> 00:27:00,181
不可能，谁造的机器？
That's impossible. Who built the machines?

270
00:27:01,057 --> 00:27:04,143
- 谁是医生？- 谁控制这个？
- Who are the doctors? - Who controls this?

271
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:06,271
控制？
Control?

272
00:27:07,605 --> 00:27:12,068
- 控制员？ - 是的，控制员。
- Controller? - Yes, the Controller.

273
00:27:12,235 --> 00:27:17,323
控制员。控制的人？我想见他，见他。
The Controller. Who controls? I would like to meet, to see him.

274
00:27:17,490 --> 00:27:22,245
不，这是不允许的。绝不允许。控制员是单独的，分开的。
No, it is not permitted. Never. The Controller is alone, apart.

275
00:27:22,412 --> 00:27:24,664
我们为他服务，任何人不得靠近。
We serve him. No one is permitted near.

276
00:27:24,831 --> 00:27:28,543
- 我们没有恶意 - 你们是来毁灭我们的。
- We intend no harm. - You have come to destroy us.

277
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:34,674
- 我们想谈谈史波克的大脑 - 大脑? 什么是大脑？
- We want to talk about Spock's brain. - Brain? What is brain?

278
00:27:35,174 --> 00:27:40,263
- 它是控制员，不是吗? - 是的。在某种程度上，它是。
- It is Controller, is it not? - Yes. In a way, it is.

279
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:43,683
人类大脑控制着个体的功能。
The human brain controls the individual's functions.

280
00:27:43,850 --> 00:27:47,228
老骨头，斯科提
Bones. Scotty.

281
00:27:48,771 --> 00:27:53,943
史波克的大脑在控制
Spock's brain controls.

282
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:56,321
这不可能
It's not possible.

283
00:28:01,576 --> 00:28:04,620
伟大的...领袖
Great... leader.

284
00:28:04,787 --> 00:28:10,168
伟大的领袖，我们从遥远的地方来向你们的控制员学习
Great leader, we come from a far place to learn from your Controller.

285
00:28:10,335 --> 00:28:14,630
你撒谎，你认识我，你是来带走控制员的
You lie. You know me. You came to take back the Controller.

286
00:28:14,797 --> 00:28:19,010
他是我们的朋友，你必须带我们去见他，我们求你了
He is our friend. You must take us to him. We beg you.

287
00:28:19,177 --> 00:28:24,682
- 不快点就晚了 - 不要把他们带到控制员那儿
- Soon it'll be too late. - Do not take them to the Controller.

288
00:28:24,849 --> 00:28:27,643
- 他们会被阻止的 - 你必须带我们走
- They will be prevented. - You must take us.

289
00:28:36,444 --> 00:28:40,156
我必须学会怎么做，跟我来
I must learn what to do. Come with me.

290
00:28:40,323 --> 00:28:43,076
- 你要把他们留在这里 - 是的，主人
- You will keep them here. - Yes, mistress.

291
00:28:55,588 --> 00:28:58,299
苏鲁：<i>舰船日志。苏鲁中尉记录</i>
SULU: <i>Ship's log. Lieutenant Sulu recording.</i>

292
00:28:58,466 --> 00:29:02,386
<i>我把</i>企业号<i>控制在西格玛龙系七号的轨道上</i>
<i>I'm holding the</i> Enterprise<i>in orbit about Sigma Draconis VII.</i>

293
00:29:02,553 --> 00:29:07,100
<i>柯克认为史波克的大脑在这个星球上的直觉似乎是正确的</i>
<i>Kirk's hunch that Spock's brain is on this planet appears to be correct.</i>

294
00:29:07,266 --> 00:29:12,605
<i>契科夫留在地面上，负责联络舰长和</i>企业号
<i>Chekov remains on the surface to liaise between the captain and</i> Enterprise.

295
00:29:21,447 --> 00:29:25,034
我从来没有过那样的感觉，我身体的每一根神经都在燃烧
I never felt anything like that. Every nerve of my body was on fire.

296
00:29:25,201 --> 00:29:28,371
我不敢相信一个人能忍受这样的痛苦
I wouldn't believe a human could take such pain.

297
00:29:28,538 --> 00:29:32,750
这些东西要保留一段时间，一定是某种磁性锁。
These are on to stay for a while. Must be a magnetic lock of some kind.

298
00:29:32,917 --> 00:29:37,755
怪不得莫格人如此顺从... ... 而且害怕
No wonder the Morgs are so obedient... and terrified.

299
00:29:41,676 --> 00:29:45,847
我们见过的原始思维是如何维持这个地方运转的？
How is this place kept functioning by the primitive minds we've met?

300
00:29:52,061 --> 00:29:56,023
那些女人永远不可能建立起这么复杂的东西
Those women could never have set up anything as complex as that.

301
00:29:56,190 --> 00:30:01,571
这需要工程天才，但那些女人身上没有这样的迹象
That takes engineering genius. There's no sign of that in those women.

302
00:30:01,737 --> 00:30:06,909
她们足够聪明，发明了这些装置来控制男人
They were smart enough to invent these devices to control men.

303
00:30:09,078 --> 00:30:13,708
- “痛苦和快乐” ，他在上面说 - 你已经注意到快乐的方面
- "Pain and delight", he said up above. - You've noticed the delight aspect.

304
00:30:13,875 --> 00:30:17,295
我当然注意到了这些令人愉快的方面
I certainly noticed those delightful aspects.

305
00:30:17,461 --> 00:30:23,467
- 那也是女人的命令 - 史波克的大脑和这个有什么关系？
- That too was commanded by women. - How does Spock's brain fit into this?

306
00:30:24,594 --> 00:30:27,972
有了通讯器，我们也许就能找到答案
With a communicator, we might be able to find out.

307
00:30:33,811 --> 00:30:36,105
这个家伙让我们无法接近
This fellow is keeping us from our property.

308
00:30:36,272 --> 00:30:41,360
- 难道没有办法纠正吗？- 科学可能会提供答案。
- Isn't there a way to correct that? - Science might provide an answer.

309
00:30:41,527 --> 00:30:44,947
- 确实，舰长 - 同意，医生
- It does, Captain. - Agreed, Doctor.

310
00:31:11,015 --> 00:31:14,644
- 科学会胜利的 - 起来，斯科提，老骨头？
Science will triumph. Come on, Scotty. Bones?

311
00:31:14,810 --> 00:31:20,316
给他们一些东西，让他们在外面待一会儿。史波克？史波克？
Give them something to keep them out a while. Spock? Spock?

312
00:31:20,942 --> 00:31:22,693
来吧，史波克
Come on, Spock.

313
00:31:23,319 --> 00:31:28,324
- 史波克，你在这个频率上 - 史波克：<i>是的，舰长，我还在这里</i>
- Spock, you were on this frequency. - SPOCK: <i>Yes, Captain. I am still here.</i>

314
00:31:28,491 --> 00:31:31,827
<i>你回到企业号了吗? </i>
<i>Have you returned to the</i> Enterprise?

315
00:31:31,994 --> 00:31:35,456
不，我们也许能找到你
No. We might be able to locate you

316
00:31:35,623 --> 00:31:38,709
如果你知道他们利用你的目的。
if you knew what they were using you for.

317
00:31:38,876 --> 00:31:41,629
- 是医学上的吗？- <i>我不确定</i>
- Is it medical? - <i>I'm not certain.</i>

318
00:31:41,796 --> 00:31:45,383
<i>我似乎有一个伸展到无限远的身体</i>
<i>I seem to have a body which stretches into infinity.</i>

319
00:31:45,549 --> 00:31:48,427
身体? 你什么都没有。
A body? You have none.

320
00:31:48,594 --> 00:31:50,596
<i>那我是什么? </i>
<i>Then what am I?</i>

321
00:31:51,514 --> 00:31:55,393
- 你是个没有实体的大脑 - <i>真有意思</i>
- You are a disembodied brain. - <i>Fascinating.</i>

322
00:31:55,559 --> 00:31:57,853
<i>这可以解释很多事情，医生</i>
<i>It could explain much, Doctor.</i>

323
00:31:58,020 --> 00:32:03,401
<i>我的延髓在努力工作，呼吸，泵血，</i>
<i>My medulla oblongata is hard at work breathing, pumping blood,</i>

324
00:32:03,567 --> 00:32:06,862
<i>维持正常的生理温度</i>
<i>maintaining a normal physiologic temperature.</i>

325
00:32:07,029 --> 00:32:12,410
- 我们没时间了 - <i>你为什么要拿自己的生命冒险</i>
- We don't have time for that. - <i>Why are you endangering your lives?</i>

326
00:32:13,244 --> 00:32:15,913
我们是来送你回去的，你在哪里？
We came to put you back. Where are you?

327
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:19,709
- <i>回到哪里？</i>- 回到你的身体里
- <i>Back where?</i> - Back into your body.

328
00:32:19,875 --> 00:32:23,379
- 我们把它带来了 - <i>想得真周到，舰长</i>
- We brought it along with us. - <i>Thoughtful, Captain.</i>

329
00:32:23,546 --> 00:32:29,468
<i>但可能不切实际。虽然我相信医生能取出碎片,</i>
<i>But probably impractical. While I might trust the doctor to remove a splinter,</i>

330
00:32:29,635 --> 00:32:32,763
<i>但我不相信他有修复大脑的知识</i>
<i>I do not believe he has the knowledge to restore a brain.</i>

331
00:32:32,930 --> 00:32:36,183
- 谢谢 - <i>无意诋毁</i>
- Thank you.
- <i>No denigration intended.</i>

332
00:32:36,350 --> 00:32:39,312
<i> 这种技术在银河系还不存在</i>
<i>That skill does not yet exist in the galaxy.</i>

333
00:32:39,478 --> 00:32:43,566
有移除它的技术。就有修复它的可能
The skill to remove it exists. Restoring it must also be possible.

334
00:32:43,733 --> 00:32:49,780
- 所以我们必须找到你 - <i>我很感激你所冒的风险</i>
- That's why we've got to get to you.
- <i>I appreciate the risks you're taking.</i>

335
00:32:49,947 --> 00:32:54,744
<i>但只有在有机会成功时，它们才值得。</i>
<i>But they are worthwhile only if there is a chance for success.</i>

336
00:32:54,910 --> 00:32:59,498
- <i>已经过了多久了？</i>- 18小时12分钟
- <i>How much time has elapsed?</i>
- 18 hours and 12 minutes.

337
00:32:59,665 --> 00:33:04,920
<i>麦考伊肯定告诉过你，24小时是我身体的极限...</i>
<i>McCoy must have told you 24 hours is the maximum my body can be...</i>

338
00:33:05,087 --> 00:33:10,968
- 我告诉他了 - 还剩5小时48分钟
- I told him. - That leaves five hours and 48 minutes.

339
00:33:11,135 --> 00:33:15,348
<i>时间似乎太短，不够培养出这种技能，不是吗？</i>
<i>It does seem all too brief a time to develop such skills, does it not?</i>

340
00:33:16,432 --> 00:33:21,103
是的，非常短。这就是为什么我们必须马上找到你
Yes, very brief. That's why we must get to you immediately.

341
00:33:21,270 --> 00:33:24,982
给我们发个信号，我们就能找到你了
Beam us a signal so we can home in on you.

342
00:33:27,151 --> 00:33:28,611
收到
Got it.

343
00:33:59,809 --> 00:34:05,314
有个问题。我们身上有疼痛装置。怎么把它们弄下来？
One question. We've got pain-giving devices on us. How do we get them off?

344
00:34:05,481 --> 00:34:08,275
<i>我会给它最高优先权</i>
<i>I shall give it top priority.</i>

345
00:34:15,866 --> 00:34:21,080
<i>我有一个答案。你们的疼痛带是手动控制的</i>
<i>I have an answer for you. Your pain bands are manually controlled.</i>

346
00:34:21,247 --> 00:34:25,334
<i>手镯上的红色按钮能打开它</i>
<i>The red button on a bracelet releases them.</i>

347
00:34:25,501 --> 00:34:28,212
<i>我知道这没有多大意义</i>
<i>I know that does not make much sense.</i>

348
00:34:28,379 --> 00:34:31,006
是的
Yes, it does.

349
00:34:44,687 --> 00:34:49,608
集中注意力，史波克，集中注意力，史波克
Keep concentrating, Spock. Keep concentrating, Spock.

350
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:58,367
一定在这里，舰长
Must be in here, Captain.

351
00:35:23,392 --> 00:35:27,146
史波克，不痛了
Spock. No pain.

352
00:35:42,828 --> 00:35:43,871
没有
No.

353
00:35:48,459 --> 00:35:50,169
走开
Go away.

354
00:36:15,569 --> 00:36:19,907
我们都会死的，你不能把控制者带走。
We will all die. You must not take the Controller away.

355
00:36:20,074 --> 00:36:24,245
控制者是年轻和强大的。完美。
The Controller is young and powerful. Perfect.

356
00:36:24,411 --> 00:36:28,624
- 史波克：<i>真是受宠若惊</i> - 你会给我们一万年的生命
- SPOCK: <i>How very flattering.</i> - You will give us life for 10,000 years.

357
00:36:28,791 --> 00:36:33,045
- 再找一个控制者 - 旧的已经完了
- Find another Controller. - The old one is finished.

358
00:36:33,212 --> 00:36:37,716
- 一万年内都不会有 - 史波克，你在一个黑盒子里
- There won't be one for 10,000 years. - Spock, you're in a black box

359
00:36:37,883 --> 00:36:44,306
与光线捆绑成一个复杂的控制面板。
tied in with light rays into a complex control panel.

360
00:36:44,473 --> 00:36:48,143
- <i>真有意思</i> - 你说你还有呼吸，
- <i>Fascinating.</i>
- You say you're breathing,

361
00:36:48,310 --> 00:36:52,982
泵血，保持体温
pumping blood, maintaining temperature.

362
00:36:53,357 --> 00:36:56,944
有没有可能你在循环空气
Is it possible that you're recirculating air,

363
00:36:57,111 --> 00:36:59,989
运转供暖设备，净化水源？
running heating plants, purifying water?

364
00:37:00,155 --> 00:37:03,409
<i>毫无疑问这是我所做工作的一部分</i>
<i>That is unquestionably part of what I'm doing.</i>

365
00:37:03,576 --> 00:37:07,329
- 他必须留下，他必须留下！- 他不会留下的。
- He must stay. He must stay! - He will not stay.

366
00:37:12,001 --> 00:37:16,964
你拿走了他的大脑，你要把它放回去，你原来是怎么做的？
Now you took his brain. You will put it back. How did you do it?

367
00:37:17,131 --> 00:37:19,633
- 我不知道 - 她不能
- I do not know. - She couldn't.

368
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:26,890
她的思维运作很简单。官能也几乎萎缩了
Her mind is functioning on a simple level. Faculties are almost atrophied.

369
00:37:27,057 --> 00:37:29,602
一定是她干的，你怎么做到的？
She must have done it. How did you do it?

370
00:37:29,768 --> 00:37:33,397
- 这是古老的知识 - 你怎么学会的？
- It was the old knowledge. - How do you get it?

371
00:37:33,564 --> 00:37:36,567
- 我把“老师”戴在头上 - 什么是“老师”？
- I put on my head the Teacher. - What is the Teacher?

372
00:37:36,734 --> 00:37:40,279
所有古老知识的老师
The Teacher of all ancient knowledge.

373
00:37:40,446 --> 00:37:46,327
<i>请允许我解释一下，她指的是这个地方建造者的知识</i>
<i>If I may explain, she refers to the knowledge of the builders of this place.</i>

374
00:37:46,493 --> 00:37:50,331
<i>我扫描了一下，一个令人印象深刻的仓库</i>
<i>I scan it. A most impressive store.</i>

375
00:38:01,133 --> 00:38:03,844
- 它是怎么运作的？给我们看看 - 我不能。
- How does it work? Show us. - I cannot.

376
00:38:04,011 --> 00:38:06,764
- 你必须告诉我们 - 我不能
- You must tell us. - I cannot.

377
00:38:06,930 --> 00:38:09,975
只有通过古人的命令我才能理解
Only by command of the ancients may I understand.

378
00:38:10,142 --> 00:38:14,188
它是怎么工作的? 给我们看看，我们会保护你的
How does it work? Show us. We'll protect you.

379
00:38:14,355 --> 00:38:19,109
<i>它是一种装置，可以为女祭司领袖的思想提供馈电回路。</i>
<i>It is a device with feeding circuits to the mind of the priestess leader.</i>

380
00:38:19,777 --> 00:38:23,739
<i>它的使用是由建造者严格预先确定的</i>
<i>Its use is strictly predetermined by the builders.</i>

381
00:38:24,156 --> 00:38:27,868
不，这知识是被禁止的。我不能知道秘密！
No, the knowledge is forbidden. I must not know the secrets!

382
00:38:28,035 --> 00:38:30,329
我会受到惩罚的！
I will be punished!

383
00:39:03,112 --> 00:39:08,742
先生们，控制者对“老师”的功能的解释是正确的
Gentlemen. The Controller's explanation of the Teacher's function is correct.

384
00:39:08,909 --> 00:39:11,662
但是他不相信我
But he gives no credit to me.

385
00:39:11,829 --> 00:39:14,790
我提供知识使用的方法
I provide the means for the knowledge to be used.

386
00:39:14,957 --> 00:39:18,794
- 没有我... - 就没有微妙的奇迹
- Without me... - There can be no delicate miracle

387
00:39:18,961 --> 00:39:21,088
能让史波克的大脑活着
that kept Spock's brain alive.

388
00:39:21,505 --> 00:39:24,717
谢谢你，医生。你真是太仁慈了
Thank you, Doctor. That was very gracious.

389
00:39:24,883 --> 00:39:29,221
是的，从一开始我就很欣赏你的能力
Yes. From the very first, I appreciated your ability.

390
00:39:29,388 --> 00:39:34,059
很好。那你也会明白，如果没有老师，
Good. Then you will also appreciate that without the Teacher,

391
00:39:34,226 --> 00:39:39,022
我就没有知识来使用你所提供的知识
I would not have the knowledge to use what you have provided.

392
00:39:43,652 --> 00:39:45,988
相位枪设定为致命
That phaser is set to kill.

393
00:39:47,406 --> 00:39:52,286
确实如此。这就是你带给我的知识。
So it is. That is the knowledge you have brought me.

394
00:40:04,757 --> 00:40:08,218
别动。如果你的武器杀人，它就会杀了你。
Do not move. If your weapon kills, it will kill you.

395
00:40:08,385 --> 00:40:12,931
我们不是第一个带来杀戮知识的人。但你会杀死史波克
We're not the first to bring knowledge of killing. But you will kill Spock.

396
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:18,187
控制者死了？控制者可以活一万年
The Controller die? The Controller will live for 10,000 years.

397
00:40:18,353 --> 00:40:20,397
我们要把我们的忠诚献给他
We shall give him our devotion.

398
00:40:20,564 --> 00:40:24,276
但是史波克会死的，他的身体现在就要死了
But Spock will be dead. His body is dying this minute.

399
00:40:24,443 --> 00:40:28,530
你不明白吗? 我的人对他们的控制者的需要
Do you not understand? The need of my people for their Controller

400
00:40:28,697 --> 00:40:30,991
比你对你的朋友的需要更多
is greater than yours for your friend.

401
00:40:31,158 --> 00:40:35,162
任何人不得杀人，不得为任何目的杀人，这是不可宽恕的
No one may kill a man. Not for any purpose. It cannot be condoned.

402
00:40:35,329 --> 00:40:36,872
不要
Do not.

403
00:40:37,831 --> 00:40:41,001
我不会杀人，我也不想杀人
I do not know killing. I do not wish to kill.

404
00:40:41,168 --> 00:40:43,003
[斯科提呻吟]
[SCOTTY GROANS]

405
00:40:47,633 --> 00:40:51,470
- 必须遵守戒律 - 你必须帮助我们
- The commandment must be fulfilled. - You must help us.

406
00:40:55,224 --> 00:41:00,270
当你来到船上的时候，你有知识，但在这里，你没有
When you came to the ship, you had the knowledge. But here, you didn't.

407
00:41:00,437 --> 00:41:03,732
- 对的 - 这种知识能持续多久？
- Correct. - How long does the knowledge last?

408
00:41:03,899 --> 00:41:07,152
- 你们的三个小时-时间刚刚够
- Three of your hours. - That's just enough time.

409
00:41:08,403 --> 00:41:12,074
如果你有这方面的知识，你能恢复你拿走的东西吗？
If you had the knowledge, could you restore what you've taken?

410
00:41:12,241 --> 00:41:15,869
- 我不会 - 你必须帮助我们。
- I would not. - You must help us.

411
00:41:16,036 --> 00:41:19,373
你必须用这种知识来恢复你所夺取的东西
You must restore with that knowledge what you have taken.

412
00:41:19,790 --> 00:41:23,460
- 不 - 你必须把你拿走的东西放回去
- No. - You must put back what you took.

413
00:41:23,627 --> 00:41:27,923
我不会背叛我的人民，控制者会留下来
I will not betray my people. The Controller will stay.

414
00:41:46,525 --> 00:41:49,236
对她有用，也许对我也有用
It worked for her. It might for me.

415
00:41:49,403 --> 00:41:53,407
<i>她是个外星人，她的大脑结构不同</i>
<i>She is an alien. The configurations of her brain are different.</i>

416
00:41:53,574 --> 00:41:57,828
<i>这可能会对你的人类大脑造成无法弥补的损伤，医生</i>
<i>It could cause irreparable damage to your human brain, Doctor.</i>

417
00:41:57,995 --> 00:42:02,082
我是一名外科医生，如果我能学会这些技术，我可能会留住它们
I'm a surgeon. If I can learn these techniques, I might retain them.

418
00:42:02,249 --> 00:42:05,794
<i>那样你也可能失去医生</i>
<i>You might lose the doctor that way.</i>

419
00:42:05,961 --> 00:42:09,965
可能会。但如果我不试试的话我们肯定会失去你
He might. But we're sure to lose you if I don't try.

420
00:42:10,132 --> 00:42:13,176
<i>你不能为了我拿自己的生命冒险</i>
<i>You cannot jeopardize your life for me.</i>

421
00:42:13,635 --> 00:42:16,471
史波克，你没听到吗？
Spock, didn't you hear?

422
00:42:16,638 --> 00:42:21,310
我也许能够保留并将这些技术带给世界
I might be able to retain and bring these techniques to the world.

423
00:42:22,144 --> 00:42:24,938
难道不值得冒这个险吗？
Isn't it worth that risk?

424
00:42:25,230 --> 00:42:28,984
难道你不坚持自己承担这样的风险吗？
Wouldn't you insist on taking such a risk yourself?

425
00:42:31,987 --> 00:42:35,198
去吧，医生。带上“老师”
Go ahead, Doctor. Put the Teacher on.

426
00:42:39,077 --> 00:42:40,495
不！
No!

427
00:43:30,379 --> 00:43:32,255
当然
Of course.

428
00:43:34,508 --> 00:43:36,385
当然
Of course.

429
00:43:37,469 --> 00:43:43,892
一个孩子就可以做到。一个孩子就可以做到
A child could do it. A child could do it.

柯克：<i>舰长日志，星历5432.3</i>
KIRK: <i>Captain's log, stardate 5432.3.</i>

431
00:43:57,239 --> 00:44:00,242
<i>麦考伊医生正在修复史波克的大脑</i>
<i>Dr. McCoy is proceeding to restore Spock's brain.</i>

432
00:44:00,409 --> 00:44:06,331
<i>我们的问题是: 我们不知道他增长的知识能持续多久</i>
<i>Our problem: we do not know how long his increased knowledge will stay.</i>

433
00:44:06,498 --> 00:44:09,918
<i>任何进一步使用这种教学设备的尝试都是不可能的</i>
<i>Any further attempt to use the teaching device is impossible.</i>

434
00:44:10,085 --> 00:44:11,878
<i>这会要了他的命</i>
<i>It would kill him.</i>

435
00:44:12,045 --> 00:44:15,632
我从没见过这样的情况，他正在以曲速进行手术
I've never seen anything like it. He's operating at warp speed.

436
00:44:15,799 --> 00:44:19,970
我想亲自试试那个“老师”
I'd like a try at that Teacher myself.

437
00:44:20,762 --> 00:44:23,181
他会回到你身边，我们也会被毁灭
You will have him back and we will be destroyed.

438
00:44:23,348 --> 00:44:28,020
你不会的，你将第一次失去你的控制着
You won't be. You'll be without your Controller for the first time.

439
00:44:28,186 --> 00:44:31,481
- 但你们会过得更好 - 我们会死的
- But you'll be better off. - We will die.

440
00:44:31,648 --> 00:44:36,695
你会得到你应有的发展，所有这些本不该属于你们
You'll develop as you should have. All of this shouldn't have been done for you.

441
00:44:36,862 --> 00:44:41,950
现在下面的女人和上面的男人将一起控制
Now the women below and men above will control together.

442
00:44:42,117 --> 00:44:45,537
- 没有痛苦他们是不会帮助我们的 - 还有别的办法
- They will not help us without the pain. - There are other ways.

443
00:44:45,704 --> 00:44:49,750
你们会发现他们的，你们必须搬去地表
You'll discover them. You must move to the surface.

444
00:44:49,916 --> 00:44:52,586
- 在上面我们会死于严寒 - 你们不会的
- We will die above in the cold. - You won't.

445
00:44:52,753 --> 00:44:57,507
你们将学习建造房屋，保持温暖，工作
You'll learn to build houses, keep warm, to work.

446
00:44:57,966 --> 00:45:00,343
我们会帮你一段时间
We'll help you for a while.

447
00:45:00,635 --> 00:45:06,099
人类在更恶劣的条件下生存下来，这是进化，你会没事的
Humans have survived under worse conditions. It's evolution. You'll be fine.

448
00:45:06,266 --> 00:45:08,185
柯克舰长！
Captain Kirk!

449
00:45:10,145 --> 00:45:13,273
- 怎么了? - 他正在遗忘
- What is it? - He's forgetting.

450
00:45:14,858 --> 00:45:18,236
- 我不能，我... - 老骨头？
- I can't. I... - Bones?

451
00:45:18,987 --> 00:45:20,572
老骨头？
Bones?

452
00:45:20,739 --> 00:45:26,078
所有的神经，有成千上万个，我该怎么办？
All the nerves. There are a million of them. What am I supposed to do?

453
00:45:27,662 --> 00:45:29,456
我该怎么办？
What am I supposed to do?

454
00:45:29,623 --> 00:45:31,541
你现在不能停下来
You can't stop now.

455
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,170
我正在用大锤穿针
I'm threading a needle with a sledgehammer.

456
00:45:35,337 --> 00:45:38,006
我该怎么办？我不记得了
What am I supposed to do? I can't remember.

457
00:45:39,091 --> 00:45:42,385
- 我不记得了 - 老骨头？
- I don't remember. - Bones?

458
00:45:42,552 --> 00:45:46,223
- 没人能修复大脑 - 你可以
- No one can restore a brain. - You could.

459
00:45:46,389 --> 00:45:48,266
不久前，这还只是小孩子的游戏
A while ago, it was child's play.

柯克：<i>舰长日志，补充</i>
KIRK: <i>Captain's log, supplemental.</i>

461
00:46:01,029 --> 00:46:04,366
<i>我们拯救史波克生命的赛跑可能是徒劳的</i>
<i>Our race to save Spock's life may have been futile.</i>

462
00:46:04,533 --> 00:46:08,120
<i>麦考伊忘了从“老师”获得的知识</i>
<i>McCoy has lost the knowledge from the Teacher.</i>

463
00:46:08,286 --> 00:46:13,708
<i>他一直在利用自己的技能试图继续手术</i>
<i>He has been drawing on his own skills in an attempt to continue the operation.</i>

464
00:46:13,875 --> 00:46:16,378
<i>但是他犹豫不决，不确定</i>
<i>But he is faltering and uncertain.</i>

465
00:46:16,545 --> 00:46:19,965
<i>希望他能借助史波克的大脑寻求帮助</i>
<i>In the hope he can draw on Spock's brain for assistance,</i>

466
00:46:20,132 --> 00:46:25,679
<i>我指示麦考伊优先连接史波克的声带</i>
<i>I instructed McCoy to give priority to connecting Spock's vocal chords.</i>

467
00:46:34,563 --> 00:46:37,107
- 怎么了？- 他快死了，我无法阻止
- Well? - He's dying and I can't stop it.

468
00:46:39,651 --> 00:46:40,986
史波克：是的
SPOCK: Yes.

469
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:45,365
- 麦考伊医生？- 史波克？
- Dr. McCoy? - Spock?

470
00:46:46,950 --> 00:46:52,664
如果你把我的语言中枢重新连接好，我也许能帮上忙
If you finish reconnecting my speech center, I might be able to help.

471
00:46:53,707 --> 00:46:55,667
语言中枢
Speech center.

472
00:46:56,710 --> 00:46:58,420
是的
Yes.

473
00:46:58,795 --> 00:47:00,881
没错
That's correct.

474
00:47:01,256 --> 00:47:03,717
一件一件来
One thing at a time.

475
00:47:04,467 --> 00:47:07,929
[清嗓子]
[GROANS]

476
00:47:10,182 --> 00:47:15,937
这样好多了，医生，试试声波分离器
That's better. Now, Doctor. Try the sonic separator.

477
00:47:16,104 --> 00:47:18,440
声波分离器...
Sonic separator...

478
00:47:18,607 --> 00:47:22,235
我已经有一些感觉了
I already have some sensation of feeling.

479
00:47:22,402 --> 00:47:28,116
刺激神经末梢，逐个观察反应
Stimulate the nerve endings and observe the reactions one by one.

480
00:47:28,992 --> 00:47:32,120
探针正确时我会告诉你
I shall tell you when the probe is correct.

481
00:47:32,287 --> 00:47:35,624
然后，你使用三激光连接器密封
You will then seal using the tri-laser connector.

482
00:47:35,790 --> 00:47:38,126
三激光连接器
Tri-laser connector.

483
00:47:43,215 --> 00:47:45,842
- 准备好了吗? - 好了
- Ready? - Ready.

484
00:47:47,302 --> 00:47:49,137
右手食指
Right forefinger.

485
00:47:51,056 --> 00:47:52,641
正确
Correct.

486
00:47:54,392 --> 00:47:57,979
右...手腕
Right... wrist.

487
00:47:58,772 --> 00:48:00,440
正确
Correct.

488
00:48:02,651 --> 00:48:04,861
右手肘
Right elbow.

489
00:48:06,613 --> 00:48:09,699
正确。非常好，医生
Correct. Very good, Doctor.

490
00:48:10,951 --> 00:48:15,247
我永远过不去这个坎儿了。这个瓦肯人在告诉我如何操作。
I'll never live this down. This Vulcan is telling me how to operate.

491
00:48:25,882 --> 00:48:29,177
- 完成了 - 怎么样？
- Closed. - Well?

492
00:48:29,719 --> 00:48:32,305
我本可能犯一千个错误。
I could have made a thousand mistakes.

493
00:48:32,472 --> 00:48:36,476
密封神经末梢。加入神经节
Sealing nerve endings. Joining ganglia.

494
00:48:36,643 --> 00:48:40,647
液体平衡是正确的，但我不知道
The fluid balance is correct, but I don't know.

495
00:48:50,532 --> 00:48:53,076
恭喜你，医生。谢谢。
Congratulations, Doctor. And thank you.

496
00:48:53,243 --> 00:48:57,205
- 你觉得怎么样？ - 总的来说，我很健康
- How do you feel? - On the whole, I am quite fit.

497
00:48:57,622 --> 00:49:01,793
这真有意思。倒退文明的一个杰出例子
This is fascinating. A remarkable example of a retrograde civilization.

498
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:05,088
巅峰时，超越我们的能力
At the peak, advanced beyond our capabilities,

499
00:49:05,255 --> 00:49:08,008
现在在这个原始水平上运作
and now operating at this primitive level.

500
00:49:08,174 --> 00:49:12,679
这一切都始于几千年前，当时冰川时代再次出现
And it all began thousands of years ago, when a glacial age reoccurred.

501
00:49:12,846 --> 00:49:16,474
这个体系是为女性建造的。男人留在上面
This complex was built for women. Men remained above.

502
00:49:16,641 --> 00:49:20,979
发生了男女分裂。一个有意思的文化发展...
A male-female schism took place. A fascinating cultural development...

503
00:49:21,146 --> 00:49:24,607
- 我不该做的 - 做什么？
- I shouldn't have done it. - What's that?

504
00:49:25,066 --> 00:49:27,485
我不该重新连接他的嘴
I should have never reconnected his mouth.

505
00:49:31,990 --> 00:49:35,076
好吧，我们冒了风险，医生
Well, we took the risk, Doctor.

506
00:49:36,411 --> 00:49:41,207
正如我所说，这是一种多年未见的文化发展
As I was saying, a cultural development that hasn't been seen in ages.

507
00:49:41,374 --> 00:49:45,712
最近一次发生在旧地球上，当时罗马人...
The last such occurrence took place on old Earth when the Romans...
