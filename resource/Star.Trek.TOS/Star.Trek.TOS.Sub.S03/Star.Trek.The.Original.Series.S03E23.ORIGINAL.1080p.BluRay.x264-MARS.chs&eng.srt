00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:08,357
[柯克]舰长日志，星历5943.7
[KIRK] Captain's log, stardate 5943.7.

2
00:00:09,035 --> 00:00:14,283
我们计算出贝塔奈奥比将在大约三个半小时内变成新星
We have calculated that Beta Niobe will go nova in approximately three and a half hours.

3
00:00:14,879 --> 00:00:18,651
它唯一的卫星萨佩顿是一颗M级行星
Its only satellite, Sarpeidon, is a Class-M planet,

4
00:00:18,663 --> 00:00:22,555
根据上次报告，那里居住着一个开化的类人物种
which, at last report, was inhabited by a civilized humanoid species.

5
00:00:23,483 --> 00:00:27,195
我们的仪器显示，星球上没有任何智慧生命存在
Now our instruments show that no intelligent life remains on the planet.

6
00:00:27,788 --> 00:00:30,092
我们检测到的能量源就在这栋楼里，舰长
The power source we detected is in this building, Captain.

7
00:00:30,819 --> 00:00:31,843
有幸存者的迹象吗？
Any sign of survivors?

8
00:00:32,607 --> 00:00:34,437
没有智能生命形式的迹象
No signs of sapient life-forms.

9
00:00:35,065 --> 00:00:37,664
一个满是人的星球怎么可能就这样消失了呢？
How can a planet full of people just disappear?

10
00:00:37,741 --> 00:00:39,275
如果他们知道他们的太阳正在死亡
If they knew that their sun was dying,

11
00:00:39,292 --> 00:00:41,229
那可能发生任何事情包括大规模自杀
it could be anything up to mass suicide.

12
00:00:41,548 --> 00:00:44,044
报告说他们没有任何太空飞行能力
Reports deny that they had any space-flight capability.

13
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:48,746
这似乎是一个档案或某种图书馆
This appears to be an archive, or library of some kind.

14
00:00:50,507 --> 00:00:52,118
那么我们来对地方了
Then we're certainly in the right place

15
00:00:52,147 --> 00:00:53,734
要查明发生了什么
to find out what happened,

16
00:00:54,149 --> 00:00:56,479
居民在哪里以及现在是否有留下来的人
where the inhabitants are, and if there are any left now.

17
00:00:58,228 --> 00:00:59,934
嗯，这很好。我们从哪里开始呢？
Well, that's fine. Where do we start?

18
00:00:59,934 --> 00:01:00,662
我能帮你吗？
May I help you?

19
00:01:03,468 --> 00:01:04,949
我是图书管理员
I am the librarian.

20
00:01:05,943 --> 00:01:07,004
我可以帮忙吗？
May I be of assistance?

21
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:09,407
也许你可以，怎么称呼？
Perhaps you can, Mr...?

22
00:01:09,467 --> 00:01:10,396
阿托兹先生
Mr. Atoz.

23
00:01:11,207 --> 00:01:13,440
我承认看到你们我有点意外
I confess that I'm a little surprised to see you.

24
00:01:14,038 --> 00:01:16,278
我还以为大家早就走了
I had thought that everyone had long since gone.

25
00:01:18,188 --> 00:01:19,809
但这是令人愉快的意外
But the surprise is a pleasant one.

26
00:01:20,338 --> 00:01:24,542
毕竟，图书馆的目的就是给人使用的
After all, a library serves no purpose unless someone is using it.

27
00:01:24,915 --> 00:01:26,283
你说所有人都走了？他们去哪儿了？
You say everyone is gone? Where'd they go?

28
00:01:26,585 --> 00:01:28,468
当然，这取决于个人
It depended on the individual, of course.

29
00:01:29,196 --> 00:01:31,635
如果你想追踪特定的人，很抱歉
If you wish to trace a specific person, I'm sorry,

30
00:01:32,162 --> 00:01:33,990
该信息是保密的
but that information is confidential.

31
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:36,982
不，不是特定的人，就是一般人
No, no particular person, just people in general.

32
00:01:37,414 --> 00:01:38,118
他们去哪儿了？
Where did they go?

33
00:01:38,563 --> 00:01:41,429
啊，你觉得很难选择，是这样吗？
Ah, you find it difficult to choose, is that it?

34
00:01:42,347 --> 00:01:45,444
是的，选择范围太广有利也有弊
Yes, a wide range of alternatives is a mixed blessing,

35
00:01:46,308 --> 00:01:47,332
但也许我可以提供帮助
but perhaps I can help.

36
00:01:48,132 --> 00:01:49,668
请你们走这边好吗？
Would you step this way, please?

37
00:02:01,246 --> 00:02:01,968
要我帮忙吗？
May I help you?

38
00:02:02,932 --> 00:02:06,397
你可以从20,000多张拟真磁带中进行选择
You may select from more than 20,000 verisim tapes,

39
00:02:07,171 --> 00:02:10,243
其中数百张是最近才添加到收藏中的
several hundred of which have only recently been added to the collection.

40
00:02:10,914 --> 00:02:13,346
我相信你会在这里找到令你满意的东西
I'm sure you'll find something here that pleases you.

41
00:02:13,787 --> 00:02:16,685
先生，你对什么特别感兴趣？
You, sir, what is your particular field of interest?

42
00:02:17,329 --> 00:02:18,353
最近的历史呢？
What about recent history?

43
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:20,480
真的吗？噢，那太糟糕了
Really? Oh, that's too bad.

44
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:22,533
我们对最近的历史知之甚少
We have so little on recent history.

45
00:02:22,914 --> 00:02:24,165
没有人需要它
There was no demand for it.

46
00:02:24,738 --> 00:02:26,009
不必很全面
It doesn't have to be extensive.

47
00:02:26,348 --> 00:02:27,820
只要几个问题的答案
Just the answers to a few questions.

48
00:02:28,846 --> 00:02:29,841
当然可以
Of course.

49
00:02:30,666 --> 00:02:32,970
服务台提供参考服务
Reference services available at the desk.

50
00:02:44,052 --> 00:02:46,356
你来晚了。你去哪儿了？
You're very late. Where have you been?

51
00:02:46,867 --> 00:02:49,249
你很敏捷，阿托兹先生
You're a very agile man, Mr. Atoz.

52
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:51,874
你们有多少人？
Just how many of you are there?

53
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:07,708
[柯克]宇宙，最后的边疆
[KIRK] Space, the final frontier.

54
00:03:14,342 --> 00:03:17,606
这些是星舰企业号的航程
These are the voyages of the starship Enterprise.

55
00:03:18,676 --> 00:03:22,348
它的五年任务：探索未知的新世界
Its five-year mission: To explore strange new worlds,

56
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:25,671
寻找新生命和新文明
to seek out new life and new civilizations,

57
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:29,559
勇踏前人未至之境
to boldly go where no man has gone before.

58
00:03:30,357 --> 00:03:33,711
星际旅行：原初
第三季第二十三集

59
00:04:06,856 --> 00:04:09,144
我们所有的 "昨天"


60
00:04:17,635 --> 00:04:19,884
我们一知道发生了什么就来了
We came as soon as we knew what was happening.

61
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,689
原谅我，先生，这是我的错
Forgive me, sir. It is my fault.

62
00:04:22,771 --> 00:04:24,307
我一定是算错了
I must have miscalculated.

63
00:04:24,845 --> 00:04:27,341
我们的读数表明这里根本没有人
Our readings indicated that there was no one here at all.

64
00:04:27,644 --> 00:04:28,386
我当然知道
Of course I know.

65
00:04:29,046 --> 00:04:32,210
很久以前，这个星球上的每个人都被警告过新星即将到来
Everyone on this planet was warned of the coming nova long ago.

66
00:04:32,808 --> 00:04:34,947
他们遵循了指示，现在安全了
They followed instructions and are now safe.

67
00:04:35,172 --> 00:04:36,773
你们最好也这样做
And you had better do the same.

68
00:04:37,295 --> 00:04:38,279
你说他们安全了？
Did you say they were the safe?

69
00:04:38,549 --> 00:04:40,859
当然，每一个人
Absolutely. Every single one.

70
00:04:41,425 --> 00:04:42,096
他们去哪儿了？
Where did they go?

71
00:04:42,525 --> 00:04:44,125
当然是他们想去的地方
Wherever they wanted to go, of course.

72
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:47,106
这完全取决于个人的选择
It is strictly up to the individual's choice.

73
00:04:47,337 --> 00:04:47,986
我明白了
I see.

74
00:04:49,405 --> 00:04:54,085
而你亲自将星球上的所有这些人送到了安全地点？
And you personally sent all these people on the planet to safety?

75
00:04:54,415 --> 00:04:56,862
对，对，对，他们都走了
Yes, yes, yes. They are all gone,

76
00:04:57,379 --> 00:04:58,523
除了你们三个
except you three.

77
00:04:59,194 --> 00:05:03,181
当然，我不得不将简单的任务委托给我的复制品
Of course, I had to delegate the simple tasks to my replicas.

78
00:05:07,371 --> 00:05:10,414
你是真的那个吗，阿托兹先生？
You are the real one, Mr. Atoz?

79
00:05:11,017 --> 00:05:13,961
当然，我是真正的阿托兹先生
Of course. I am the real Mr. Atoz.

80
00:05:14,548 --> 00:05:16,532
说真的，他很真实，吉姆
As a matter of fact, he's quite real, Jim.

81
00:05:20,509 --> 00:05:22,440
让我们带你去一个安全的地方
Let us take you with us to a place of safety.

82
00:05:22,599 --> 00:05:23,396
不，谢谢
No, thank you.

83
00:05:23,963 --> 00:05:26,715
我计划在时机成熟时和我的妻子和家人团聚
I plan to join my wife and family when the time comes.

84
00:05:27,752 --> 00:05:29,715
现在，不要担心我
Now, don't be concerned about me.

85
00:05:29,985 --> 00:05:31,041
想想你们自己
Think of yourselves.

86
00:05:31,475 --> 00:05:33,075
我迫切地警告你
I warn you most urgently.

87
00:05:33,537 --> 00:05:35,585
趁现在还不晚，赶紧逃吧
Make your escape before it's too late.

88
00:05:37,865 --> 00:05:39,913
图书馆随时为你服务
The library is at your complete service.

89
00:05:40,555 --> 00:05:43,819
我很乐意为你提供所有参考资料来帮助你
I will gladly supply you with all reference material to help you.

90
00:05:43,948 --> 00:05:46,994
有这颗星球方方面面的历史
History of the planet is available in every detail.

91
00:05:47,868 --> 00:05:50,371
只要选择你最感兴趣的
Just choose what interests you the most.

92
00:05:50,904 --> 00:05:53,275
千年，世纪，天，瞬间
The millennium, the century, the date, the moment.

93
00:05:53,632 --> 00:05:55,384
图书馆是你的钥匙
The library is your key.

94
00:05:56,206 --> 00:05:58,062
哦！它在错误的档案里
Oh! It's in the wrong file.

95
00:05:58,549 --> 00:06:01,573
你们自己选择，但请记住，你们已经很晚了
Make your own selection, but remember, you're very late.

96
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:03,575
我保证我们会尽快选择
I swear we'll choose it as quick as we can.

97
00:06:03,575 --> 00:06:04,332
距离新星还有多久？
How long till nova?

98
00:06:04,471 --> 00:06:05,751
3小时13分钟
3hours, 13 minutes.

99
00:06:05,889 --> 00:06:07,212
先生们，这不是…
This, gentleman, is not ...

100
00:06:07,221 --> 00:06:10,746
先生，我想你会在这里找到一些有趣的东西
You, sir. I think you'll find something interesting over here.

101
00:06:18,708 --> 00:06:21,028
[阿托兹]嗯，如果这些都不行
[ATOZ] Now, if these won't do,

102
00:06:21,837 --> 00:06:23,028
我可以给你拿另一个文件
I can bring you another file.

103
00:06:36,787 --> 00:06:38,872
[电子嗡嗡声]
[ELECTRONIC HUMMING]

104
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,446
先生，你选好了吗？
Have you made your selection, sir?

105
00:07:04,245 --> 00:07:06,447
到底要我选什么？
Exactly what is it that I'm expected to select?

106
00:07:06,912 --> 00:07:08,362
我确定我说得很清楚
I'm sure I was clear.

107
00:07:08,764 --> 00:07:10,438
你感兴趣的时期
The period in which you're interested.

108
00:07:11,003 --> 00:07:11,588
我明白了
I see.

109
00:07:12,514 --> 00:07:14,708
这是一台迷人的机器，它是什么？
This is a fascinating machine. What is it?

110
00:07:15,064 --> 00:07:17,944
啊，这是间时
Ah, this is the atavachron.

111
00:07:18,565 --> 00:07:19,717
一个有趣的命名
An interesting nomenclature.

112
00:07:20,564 --> 00:07:22,447
它是如何工作的？我能试试吗？
How does it work? May I?

113
00:07:22,478 --> 00:07:23,506
哦，不，先生，不
Oh, no, sir, no.

114
00:07:24,193 --> 00:07:26,538
我必须要求你不要触摸控制装置
I must ask you not to touch the controlling mechanism.

115
00:07:27,058 --> 00:07:28,394
放回并做出选择
Return and make your selection.

116
00:07:29,098 --> 00:07:33,001
你选好后，我将通过间时为你做好准备
When you have chosen, I will prepare you through the atavachron.

117
00:07:35,143 --> 00:07:36,551
谢谢，阿托兹先生
Thank you, Mr. Atoz.

史波克，老骨头
Spock. Bones.

120
00:07:49,412 --> 00:07:51,111
等等！我还没帮你准备好
Wait! I haven't prepared you.

121
00:07:56,622 --> 00:07:57,326
[男人笑]
[MEN LAUGH]

122
00:08:04,062 --> 00:08:05,406
你们必须准备好！
You must be prepared!

123
00:08:12,651 --> 00:08:13,761
这是什么地方？
What is this place?

124
00:08:13,948 --> 00:08:15,562
是的，舰长呢？
Yes, and where is the captain?

125
00:08:16,056 --> 00:08:18,104
你这个肮脏的东西！让我走！
You dirty thing! Let go of me!

126
00:08:24,187 --> 00:08:25,403
可恶的狐狸精！
Vile vixen!

127
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,848
叫你来你就来，奴隶！
Come when you are bidden, slave!

128
00:08:33,347 --> 00:08:36,186
你需要学习如何发挥你的优点
You need a lesson in how to use your betters.

129
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,560
谁是你的主人？
Who's your master?

130
00:08:38,135 --> 00:08:39,321
我是一个自由人，先生
I'm a free man, sir.

131
00:08:39,987 --> 00:08:42,122
那么你需要更好的礼节，自由人
Then you want better manners, free man.

132
00:08:42,966 --> 00:08:43,990
防守
Defend yourself.

133
00:09:02,646 --> 00:09:04,648
[全笑]
[ALL LAUGH]

135
00:09:17,164 --> 00:09:19,403
加热这块巨石可能会提供一些暂时的热量
Heating this boulder may provide some temporary heat.

136
00:09:24,833 --> 00:09:25,535
怎么了？
What's wrong?

137
00:09:26,013 --> 00:09:28,317
什么东西让我的相位枪不能用了
Something's preventing my phaser from operating.

138
00:09:33,336 --> 00:09:34,578
噢，谢谢你，兄弟
Oh, thank you, man.

139
00:09:35,224 --> 00:09:37,559
当那个蠢蛋抓到我割他钱包的时候
I thought I'd be limbered sure

140
00:09:37,559 --> 00:09:39,356
我本以为一定会被他折磨一通
when that gull caught me cutting his purse.

141
00:09:39,427 --> 00:09:41,347
那是什么？你没事儿吧？
What's that? Are you all right?

142
00:09:42,221 --> 00:09:44,887
哦，我把你当成伪君子了
Oh, I took you to be an angler,

143
00:09:45,813 --> 00:09:47,981
但你不是我们中的一员，是吗？
but you're none of us, are ya?

144
00:09:48,831 --> 00:09:53,176
好吧，对他们所有人你都不是一个好欺负的人
Well, you're a bully fine coe for all of that.

145
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:53,980
谢谢
Thank you.

146
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:57,242
你给了他们一记漂亮的下马威，那些纨绔子弟
What a handsome dish you served them, the coxcombs.

147
00:09:58,596 --> 00:10:00,087
你最好和我一起去图书馆
You better come back with me to the library.

148
00:10:00,087 --> 00:10:01,216
你在那里会很安全
You'll be safe there.

149
00:10:01,374 --> 00:10:02,769
麦考伊医生可以治那些瘀伤
Dr. McCoy can see to those bruises.

150
00:10:03,435 --> 00:10:06,269
好的，亲爱的，领路，我会跟上的
I'm game, love. Lead and I'll follow.

151
00:10:06,956 --> 00:10:08,920
图书馆在哪里？
Where's library?

152
00:10:09,022 --> 00:10:09,982
就在那里…
It's right over there ...

153
00:10:25,774 --> 00:10:27,141
舰长呢，史波克？
Where's the captain, Spock?

154
00:10:27,677 --> 00:10:28,893
我们就跟在他后面
We were right behind him.

155
00:10:35,381 --> 00:10:36,789
你怎么了，兄弟？
What's with you, man?

156
00:10:37,529 --> 00:10:40,663
让我们在纨绔子弟和肩部拍板出现之前离开
Let's make off before coxcombs come with shoulder clappers.

157
00:10:40,724 --> 00:10:42,841
不，你还记得你第一次见我是什么时候吗？
No. Do you remember when you first saw me?

158
00:10:43,385 --> 00:10:45,920
你记得我是不是通过某扇门进来的吗？
Do you remember whether I came through some kind of door?

159
00:10:46,423 --> 00:10:49,378
哦，我想那个蠢蛋一定是踢到你的头了
Oh, I think the wrong gull must have kicked you in the head.

160
00:10:49,853 --> 00:10:53,008
来吧，亲爱的，我认识一个不会问任何问题的吸血鬼
Come on, love. I know a leech who'll ask no questions.

161
00:10:53,084 --> 00:10:54,718
不，不，它一定在这儿某个地方
No. No. It must be here someplace.

162
00:10:54,926 --> 00:10:55,410
吉姆！
Jim!

163
00:10:55,985 --> 00:10:57,261
吉姆，你能听到我们说话吗？
Jim, can you hear us?

164
00:10:57,842 --> 00:10:58,896
老骨头？史波克？
Bones? Spock?

165
00:11:00,381 --> 00:11:03,389
舰长，我们听到了你的声音，但我们看不见你
Captain, we hear you, but we cannot see you.

166
00:11:04,437 --> 00:11:05,589
你没事儿吧？
Are you all right?

167
00:11:07,098 --> 00:11:08,698
我们一定出于某种原因错过了彼此
We must've missed each other somehow.

168
00:11:08,976 --> 00:11:09,703
是的
Agreed.

169
00:11:10,192 --> 00:11:13,311
显然，他们退回到过去
Apparently they've all escaped the destruction of their world

170
00:11:13,337 --> 00:11:15,070
逃脱了世界的毁灭
by retreating into its past.

171
00:11:15,617 --> 00:11:18,324
怜悯我们，是鬼魂
Mercy on us. It's spirits.

172
00:11:18,593 --> 00:11:21,357
不，不，不，这些是我的朋友，他们是…
No, no, no. These are friends of mine, and they're ...

173
00:11:22,476 --> 00:11:23,948
史波克，你在图书馆吗？
Spock, are you in the library?

174
00:11:24,552 --> 00:11:25,418
实际不是
Indeed not.

175
00:11:25,916 --> 00:11:28,587
我们身处北极特色的荒野
We're in a wilderness of arctic characteristics.

176
00:11:28,939 --> 00:11:30,358
他的意思是很冷
He means it's cold.

177
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:32,022
你能回图书馆吗？
Can you get back to the library?

178
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:34,862
没有图书馆，舰长
There is no library, Captain.

179
00:11:35,197 --> 00:11:36,590
至少我们没有看到
At least not that we can see.

180
00:11:37,894 --> 00:11:39,942
我们在冰崖的底部
We're at the base of an ice cliff.

181
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:41,356
说说
Explain.

182
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:44,153
舰长,就在你消失之前
Just before you disappeared, Captain,

183
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:48,871
我发现了一台阿托兹先生称之为间时的机器
I discovered a machine which Mr. Atoz called the atavachron.

184
00:11:49,079 --> 00:11:52,865
它一定以某种方式绑定了磁带查看器
It must have been tied into the tape viewer somehow.

185
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:56,320
打开通往过去的时间传送门
Opening time portals to the past.

186
00:11:56,773 --> 00:11:59,638
就进入了你正在查看的时期
You cross through into the period which you were viewing.

187
00:11:59,811 --> 00:12:02,299
我在查看关于他们冰河时代的资料
I was looking over some material about their Ice Age.

188
00:12:02,706 --> 00:12:04,493
我在这里显然是因为
I am here, evidently, because

189
00:12:04,493 --> 00:12:07,754
我和麦考伊医生跨入了同一个时刻
I stepped through at the same instant as Doctor McCoy.

190
00:12:08,568 --> 00:12:09,736
是的…
Yes...

191
00:12:09,903 --> 00:12:11,696
[脚步声]
[FOOTSTEPS]

192
00:12:13,245 --> 00:12:15,016
我的朋友们带着增援回来了
My friends are coming back with reinforcements.

193
00:12:16,539 --> 00:12:18,501
她的同伙，逮捕他
There's the mort's accomplice. Arrest him.

194
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:22,632
我们就是法律，现在要求你们伏法
We are the law, and do require that you yield to us.

195
00:12:22,669 --> 00:12:23,295
什么罪名？
On what charge?

196
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:24,694
偷窃和割皮包
Thievery and purse cutting.

197
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,064
那是误会，我不是小偷
That's a mistake. I'm no thief.

198
00:12:26,419 --> 00:12:27,279
发生了什么？
What's happening?

199
00:12:27,513 --> 00:12:28,602
主啊，帮助我们，那是什么？
Lord help us. What's that?

200
00:12:28,679 --> 00:12:29,829
这是鬼魂
It's spirits.

201
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:33,095
走吧，走吧，鬼魂，让诚实的人靠近
Away. Away, spirit, and let honest men approach.

202
00:12:33,162 --> 00:12:33,738
继续说话！
Keep talking!

203
00:12:33,823 --> 00:12:34,459
舰长！
Captain!

204
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:36,128
他们按照他的吩咐说话
They speak at his bidding.

205
00:12:36,535 --> 00:12:38,135
让他闭嘴，他们就会安静
Stop his mouth and they'll quiet.

206
00:12:38,418 --> 00:12:40,311
你必须靠近传送门
You must be close to the portal.

207
00:12:40,433 --> 00:12:41,393
现在继续说！
Keep talking now!

208
00:12:45,364 --> 00:12:46,580
吉姆，怎么了？
Jim, what's the matter?

209
00:12:51,236 --> 00:12:52,900
吉姆听起来好像遇到了麻烦
Jim sounded like he was in trouble.

210
00:12:53,226 --> 00:12:54,742
我们自己可能有麻烦了
We may be in trouble ourselves.

211
00:12:54,951 --> 00:12:56,359
我们必须找到避难所
We must find shelter.

212
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:20,450
在这种严寒中，我们活不了太久
In this severe cold, we cannot survive much longer.

213
00:13:21,254 --> 00:13:22,406
把我留在这儿，史波克
Leave me here, Spock.

214
00:13:23,503 --> 00:13:25,149
我们一起走否则就停下
We go together or not at all.

215
00:13:25,238 --> 00:13:26,070
别傻了
Don't be a fool.

216
00:13:26,917 --> 00:13:29,945
我的手和脸都冻伤了，我感觉不到我的脚
My hands and face are frostbitten, I can't feel my feet.

217
00:13:30,658 --> 00:13:31,808
一个人你有机会
Alone you have a chance.

218
00:13:31,858 --> 00:13:34,610
照我说的做，去找吉姆
Now do what I say. Go try to find Jim.

219
00:13:34,662 --> 00:13:35,698
我们一起去！
We go together!

220
00:13:36,827 --> 00:13:39,439
你这个固执，厚脸皮的瓦肯人！
You stubborn, thick-headed Vulcan!

221
00:14:42,178 --> 00:14:44,034
他正因你们的恶劣天气而受苦
He is suffering from the severity of your weather.

222
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:50,243
不幸的是，他是医生，不是我
Unfortunately, he is the doctor, not I.

223
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:11,585
我会避免在这个时候给他任何药物
I'll avoid giving him any medication at this time.

224
00:15:12,994 --> 00:15:16,037
或许，要是让他保持安静和温暖，他能自然而然地恢复
Perhaps, if he's kept quiet and warm, he may recover naturally.

225
00:15:17,859 --> 00:15:19,410
这里温暖宜人
It is agreeably warm here.

226
00:15:24,185 --> 00:15:25,019
你叫什么？
What are you called?

227
00:15:27,166 --> 00:15:28,154
我叫史波克
I'm called Spock.

228
00:15:30,336 --> 00:15:31,802
连你的名字都很奇怪
Even your name is strange.

229
00:15:33,506 --> 00:15:36,578
原谅我，我从没见过长得像你这样的人
Forgive me. I've never seen anyone who looks like you.

230
00:15:54,125 --> 00:15:55,072
你们为什么在这？
Why are you here?

231
00:15:55,855 --> 00:15:57,041
你们也是囚犯吗？
Are you prisoners too?

232
00:15:57,733 --> 00:15:58,321
囚犯？
Prisoners?

233
00:15:59,321 --> 00:16:01,570
这是佐尔·汗想想让某人消失时
This is one of the places Zor Kahn sends people

234
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:03,097
送他们去的地方之一
when he wants them to disappear.

235
00:16:06,185 --> 00:16:07,702
你不是通过时间传送门来的吗？
Didn't you come in through the time portal?

236
00:16:07,915 --> 00:16:10,283
是的，我们通过时间传送门过来，但不是作为囚犯
Yes, we came through the time portal, but not as prisoners.

237
00:16:11,274 --> 00:16:12,531
我们无意中被送到了这里
We were sent here by mistake.

238
00:16:15,752 --> 00:16:17,828
间时很远
The atavachron is far away,

239
00:16:18,606 --> 00:16:21,141
但我认为你来自更远的某个地方
but I think you come from someplace farther than that.

240
00:16:22,698 --> 00:16:26,282
没错，我根本不是来自你所知道的世界
That is true. I am not from the world you know at all.

241
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:30,290
我的家乡是数百万光年之外的一颗行星
My home is a planet millions of light years away.

242
00:16:30,646 --> 00:16:31,949
哦，多么美妙！
Oh, how wonderful!

243
00:16:32,722 --> 00:16:35,154
我一直很喜欢关于这种可能性的书
I've always loved books about such possibilities.

244
00:16:39,475 --> 00:16:40,803
但它们只是故事
But they're only stories.

245
00:16:43,398 --> 00:16:45,576
这不是真的
This isn't real.

246
00:16:48,197 --> 00:16:50,023
这一切一定都是我的想象
I must be imagining all this.

247
00:16:53,224 --> 00:16:55,976
我要疯了！[呜咽]
I'm going mad! [SOBS]

248
00:16:58,145 --> 00:17:01,530
听我说，我坚信我确实存在
Listen to me. I am firmly convinced that I do exist.

249
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:03,865
我是真实的
I am substantial.

250
00:17:05,193 --> 00:17:06,429
不是你的想象
You are not imagining this.

251
00:17:10,032 --> 00:17:14,632
哦，我已经在这里很久了，一个人
Oh, I've been here for so long, alone.

252
00:17:17,258 --> 00:17:18,858
当我看到你在外面时
When I saw you out there,

253
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,998
我不敢相信
I couldn't believe it.

254
00:17:35,958 --> 00:17:36,790
他要死了吗？
Is he dying?

255
00:17:58,277 --> 00:17:59,173
这是死神
Here. There's the mort.

256
00:18:01,175 --> 00:18:02,398
还有死神的追随者
And there's the mort's henchman.

257
00:18:07,289 --> 00:18:08,052
打开
Open up.

258
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:15,658
叫醒他
Rouse him.

259
00:18:34,156 --> 00:18:36,652
你是与鬼魂交谈的小偷
You are the thief who talks to spirits.

260
00:18:37,718 --> 00:18:39,318
不，我是陌生人
No. I'm a stranger.

261
00:18:40,883 --> 00:18:41,779
你从哪来？
Where are you from?

262
00:18:42,853 --> 00:18:43,635
一座岛屿
An island.

263
00:18:44,093 --> 00:18:45,299
什么岛？
What is this island?

264
00:18:49,544 --> 00:18:50,504
它被称为地球
It's called Earth.

265
00:18:52,806 --> 00:18:55,406
我不知道地球岛
I know no island Earth.

266
00:18:56,841 --> 00:18:57,884
没关系，继续说
No matter. Continue.

267
00:18:59,075 --> 00:19:01,379
今晚之前我从未见过那个女人
I never saw that woman before tonight.

268
00:19:02,047 --> 00:19:04,927
当她尖叫时
When she screamed,

269
00:19:05,322 --> 00:19:09,343
据我所知，她正受到攻击
as far as I could tell, she was being attacked.

270
00:19:09,838 --> 00:19:11,608
那你否认是她的同谋？
Then you deny being her accomplice?

271
00:19:11,675 --> 00:19:12,888
是的，我否认
Yes, I deny it.

272
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:16,427
当我听到她的尖叫声时，我正在图书馆阅读
I was reading in the library when I heard her scream.

273
00:19:19,129 --> 00:19:21,881
大人，图书馆？
My lord, the library?

274
00:19:22,256 --> 00:19:24,377
你记得图书馆在哪里吗，大人？
Do you remember where the library is, my lord?

275
00:19:25,358 --> 00:19:28,622
也许你在这件事中是无辜的
Perhaps your part in this is innocent.

276
00:19:30,512 --> 00:19:32,078
我相信你是一个诚实的人
I believe you to be an honest man.

277
00:19:32,528 --> 00:19:33,647
他是个巫师！
He's a witch!

278
00:19:36,507 --> 00:19:40,941
小心，女人，我确信你有罪
Take care, woman. I'm convinced of your guilt.

279
00:19:41,407 --> 00:19:44,607
不要用虚假的指控加重罪行
Do not compound it with false accusation.

280
00:19:44,888 --> 00:19:47,005
他对看不见的鬼魂说话
He speaks to unseen spirits.

281
00:19:47,569 --> 00:19:48,849
他是个巫师
He's a witch.

282
00:19:49,442 --> 00:19:51,106
你听到了声音！
You heard the voices!

283
00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:52,682
是真的，大人
It's truth, my lord.

284
00:19:54,179 --> 00:19:55,777
我听到鬼魂和他说话
I heard the spirit talk to him.

285
00:19:56,210 --> 00:19:59,324
他回答并叫它老骨头
He answered and did call it Bones.

286
00:19:59,451 --> 00:20:02,835
你是个巫师，他施了一个咒语
You're a witch. He cast a spell.

287
00:20:03,232 --> 00:20:05,822
他让我违背我的意志偷窃
He made me steal against my wish.

288
00:20:06,072 --> 00:20:07,201
你肯定不会信…
Surely you don't believe...

289
00:20:14,524 --> 00:20:16,401
你听过这些鬼魂吗？
You heard these spirits?

290
00:20:16,997 --> 00:20:19,572
是的，大人，我可以作证
Aye, my lord. I'll witness to it.

291
00:20:20,304 --> 00:20:21,953
大人，他听到的
What he heard, my lord,

292
00:20:22,416 --> 00:20:26,065
只是我在图书馆墙后的朋友
were only my friends behind the wall in the library.

293
00:20:28,288 --> 00:20:29,281
图书馆
In the library.

294
00:20:29,448 --> 00:20:31,311
我对此一无所知
I know nothing of this.

295
00:20:31,591 --> 00:20:34,583
派人去请一个精通巫术的人，让他检查一下
Send for someone learned in witchcraft and let him examine him.

296
00:20:34,736 --> 00:20:36,286
这事和我没关系
I will have nothing to do with it.

297
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:40,704
大人，至少安排我见见阿托兹先生吧
My lord, at least arrange for me to meet Mr. Atoz.

298
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,408
我不认识阿托兹！
I know of no Atoz.

299
00:20:42,475 --> 00:20:43,274
是的！是的！阿托兹！
Yes! Yes! Atoz!

300
00:20:43,284 --> 00:20:45,950
我对此一无所知，对这些事一无所知！
I know nothing of this, nothing of these matters!

301
00:20:46,302 --> 00:20:47,355
我不会听他说的！
I will not hear him!

302
00:20:47,376 --> 00:20:48,622
让我和你说话！
Let me speak to you!

303
00:20:48,714 --> 00:20:50,378
我不会听他说的！
I will not hear him!

304
00:20:50,821 --> 00:20:52,011
至少让我和你谈谈！
At least let me talk to you!

305
00:20:56,342 --> 00:21:01,206
巫师！巫师！巫师！
Witch! Witch! Witch!

306
00:21:02,082 --> 00:21:04,188
他们会烧死你
They'll burn ya.

307
00:21:20,451 --> 00:21:24,171
麦考伊，麦考伊，醒醒
McCoy. McCoy, wake up.

308
00:21:30,868 --> 00:21:31,636
你是谁？
Who are you?

309
00:21:32,196 --> 00:21:33,450
我叫扎拉贝斯
My name is Zarabeth.

310
00:21:35,208 --> 00:21:36,232
扎拉贝斯
Zarabeth.

311
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:40,445
史波克，我们在图书馆吗？
Spock, are we in the library?

312
00:21:40,602 --> 00:21:43,482
不，我们仍处于冰河时代，但目前是安全的
No, we are still in the ice age, but safe for the moment.

313
00:21:44,571 --> 00:21:45,275
吉姆
Jim.

314
00:21:47,289 --> 00:21:48,016
吉姆呢？
What about Jim?

315
00:21:48,047 --> 00:21:49,309
医生，你的状态不能起来
Doctor, you're in no condition to get up.

316
00:21:49,461 --> 00:21:50,179
你躺下休息
You lie down and rest.

317
00:21:51,314 --> 00:21:53,151
我会设法找到舰长
I shall attempt to find the captain.

318
00:21:54,423 --> 00:21:56,023
你找到他，史波克
You find him, Spock.

319
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:00,417
你不用担心我，只要找到他
Don't you worry about me. You just find him.

320
00:22:21,957 --> 00:22:22,623
史波克？
Spock?

321
00:22:26,315 --> 00:22:27,285
这个吉姆是谁？
Who is this Jim?

322
00:22:28,801 --> 00:22:32,170
他是我们的指挥官，也是我们的朋友
He's our commanding officer and our friend.

323
00:22:32,979 --> 00:22:35,616
我只看到你们两个，我不知道还有人
I saw only the two of you. I did not know there was another.

324
00:22:35,717 --> 00:22:36,694
他没有和我们一起
He did not come with us.

325
00:22:36,826 --> 00:22:39,416
他通过时间传送门被送到了另一个历史时期
He was sent through the time portal to another period in history

326
00:22:39,477 --> 00:22:40,760
比这晚得多
much later than this one.

327
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:43,685
如果我要找到他
If I'm to find him,

328
00:22:45,690 --> 00:22:47,640
只有一种可能的途径
there's only one possible avenue.

329
00:22:50,942 --> 00:22:52,809
扎拉贝斯，你能告诉我时间传送门在哪里吗？
Zarabeth, will you show me where the time portal is?

330
00:22:54,601 --> 00:22:56,585
但是你的朋友，他病了
But your friend. He is ill.

331
00:22:58,346 --> 00:22:59,007
是的，没错
Yes, that is true.

332
00:23:00,391 --> 00:23:03,393
如果我离开他，他有可能永远无法回到这艘船
If I leave him, there's a chance he may never regain the ship.

333
00:23:03,434 --> 00:23:05,251
他会被放逐在这个时代
He would then be marooned in this time period.

334
00:23:05,694 --> 00:23:07,689
但他没有死亡的危险
But he is no longer in danger of death,

335
00:23:07,902 --> 00:23:09,941
所以我已经履行了对他的主要职责
so my primary duty to him has been discharged.

336
00:23:10,915 --> 00:23:12,065
如果我留在这里
If I remain here,

337
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:17,626
我们队伍中的任何人都不能帮助柯克舰长
no one of our party would be able to aid Captain Kirk.

338
00:23:19,285 --> 00:23:20,757
你让它听起来像一个等式
You make it sound like an equation.

339
00:23:20,827 --> 00:23:21,997
它就应该是一个等式
It should be an equation.

340
00:23:23,499 --> 00:23:25,547
我应该能从逻辑上解决这个问题
I should be able to resolve this problem logically.

341
00:23:30,394 --> 00:23:32,250
也许它与间时有关
Perhaps it has something to do with the atavachron.

342
00:23:35,314 --> 00:23:37,268
如果我对它的工作原理有更多了解就好了
If only I knew more about how it worked.

343
00:23:40,306 --> 00:23:43,506
扎拉贝斯，你说你是作为囚犯被带到这里的
Zarabeth, you said that you were brought here as a prisoner.

344
00:23:45,023 --> 00:23:45,700
能否问问…？
May I ask...?

345
00:23:45,807 --> 00:23:46,340
为什么？
Why?

346
00:23:49,934 --> 00:23:52,972
我的罪行是不明智地选择了我的亲戚
My crime was in choosing my kinsmen unwisely.

347
00:23:56,381 --> 00:23:59,348
其中两人参与了谋杀佐尔·汗的阴谋
Two of them were involved in a conspiracy to kill Zor Khan.

348
00:24:00,167 --> 00:24:02,983
我记得图书馆历史磁带上的那个名字
I remember that name from the history tapes in the library.

349
00:24:03,749 --> 00:24:04,901
暴君佐尔·汗
Zor Kahn the tyrant.

350
00:24:06,248 --> 00:24:08,296
他处决我的亲属是不够的
It was not enough that he execute my kinsmen.

351
00:24:09,174 --> 00:24:11,880
佐尔·汗决心摧毁我们整个家族
Zor Kahn determined to destroy our entire family.

352
00:24:12,573 --> 00:24:15,720
他使用间时把我们送到了没人能找到的地方
He used the atavachron to send us places no one could ever find us.

353
00:24:16,949 --> 00:24:20,341
扎拉贝斯，我们必须回阿托兹先生和间时那里
Zarabeth, we must return to Mr. Atoz and the atavachron.

354
00:24:20,399 --> 00:24:23,343
我们会带着麦考伊医生，你必须和我们一起去
We will carry Dr. McCoy and you must come with us.

355
00:24:23,396 --> 00:24:25,572
我会送你和医生上船
I will send you and the doctor to the ship,

356
00:24:26,032 --> 00:24:27,568
我去找柯克舰长
and I shall search for Captain Kirk.

357
00:24:28,256 --> 00:24:29,920
我不能再通过传送门了
I can't go through the portal again.

358
00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:32,626
如果我去了，就会死
If I do, I will die.

359
00:24:37,166 --> 00:24:38,113
你不能回去？
You cannot go back?

360
00:24:42,219 --> 00:24:43,371
我们谁也不能回去
None of us can go back.

361
00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:48,493
当我们通过传送门时，我们被间时改变了
When we come through the portal, we are changed by the atavachron.

362
00:24:49,481 --> 00:24:50,478
这就是它的功能
That is its function.

363
00:24:51,592 --> 00:24:54,311
我们的基本细胞结构会根据我们进入的时间进行调整
Our basic cell structure is adjusted to the time we enter.

364
00:25:00,594 --> 00:25:01,544
你不能回去
You can't go back.

365
00:25:03,931 --> 00:25:05,531
如果你再次通过传送门
If you go through the portal again,

366
00:25:06,466 --> 00:25:08,853
当你到达另一边时，你就会死去
you will die by the time you reach the other side.

367
00:25:10,395 --> 00:25:11,035
[麦考伊]史波克？
[McCOY] Spock?

368
00:25:12,461 --> 00:25:13,351
我们在哪？
Where are we?

369
00:25:17,305 --> 00:25:18,585
你在这里很安全，麦考伊
You are safe here, McCoy.

370
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:21,110
是的，我记得你
Yes, I remember you.

371
00:25:22,063 --> 00:25:23,279
来吧，医生，回床上
Come, Doctor. Back to bed.

372
00:25:30,031 --> 00:25:31,938
你为什么还在这里，史波克？
Why are you still here, Spock?

373
00:25:32,751 --> 00:25:34,042
你为什么不在找吉姆？
Why aren't you looking for Jim?

374
00:25:34,163 --> 00:25:35,985
不可能去找他，医生
It is impossible to look for him, Doctor.

375
00:25:36,362 --> 00:25:37,322
我们回不去了
We cannot go back.

376
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:39,639
不可能是什么意思？
What do you mean, impossible?

377
00:25:40,051 --> 00:25:41,139
我们必须回去
We've got to get back.

378
00:25:41,262 --> 00:25:42,590
扎拉贝斯向我解释了
Zarabeth explained it to me.

379
00:25:43,226 --> 00:25:44,830
当我们通过传送门时
When we came through the portal,

380
00:25:45,012 --> 00:25:47,032
它改变了我们的生理结构
it altered our physiological structure.

381
00:25:47,658 --> 00:25:51,643
如果我们试图返回图书馆，我们就会死
If we attempt to return to the library, we shall die.

382
00:25:52,676 --> 00:25:55,093
你是想告诉我我们被困在这里了吗？
Are you trying to tell me that we're trapped here?

383
00:25:56,701 --> 00:25:59,036
是的，医生，我们被困住了
Yes, Doctor. We are trapped.

384
00:26:00,028 --> 00:26:02,420
就像吉姆也被困在了他所在的地方
Just as Jim is trapped wherever he is.

385
00:26:06,618 --> 00:26:09,626
[柯克]舰长日志，星历5943.9
[KIRK] Captain's log, stardate 5943.9.

386
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:11,712
这个时代的人相信巫师
The people of this time believe in witches,

387
00:26:12,307 --> 00:26:14,400
我被指控会巫术
and witchcraft is what I've been accused of.

388
00:26:14,872 --> 00:26:17,381
五名目击者听到麦考伊和我说话
Five witnesses heard McCoy's voice speak to me

389
00:26:17,381 --> 00:26:18,826
并认为那是邪灵
and thought it was an evil spirit.

390
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:21,564
根据我对巫术审判的了解
From what I know of witchcraft trials,

391
00:26:22,251 --> 00:26:23,595
我没有太多机会
I don't have much chance

392
00:26:23,787 --> 00:26:26,283
除非我能找到检察官
unless I can get to the prosecutor.

393
00:26:28,642 --> 00:26:29,980
没有晚餐给你，亲爱的
No supper for you, love.

394
00:26:35,272 --> 00:26:35,866
来吧
Come on.

395
00:26:37,404 --> 00:26:38,137
你上去吧
Up you go.

396
00:26:53,428 --> 00:26:54,365
把你的杯子给我
Give me your cup.

397
00:27:04,369 --> 00:27:06,669
要是喊出来，就折断你的手
Cry out and I'll break it.

398
00:27:15,269 --> 00:27:16,123
别动
Don't move.

399
00:27:50,430 --> 00:27:53,950
狱卒！狱卒！
Jailor! Jailor!

400
00:27:57,312 --> 00:27:59,646
我被诬告了，你知道的
I'm being falsely accused. You know that.

401
00:28:00,084 --> 00:28:03,412
你和我一起去宗教法庭
You will come with me before the inquisitional tribunal.

402
00:28:04,144 --> 00:28:06,905
你巫术的事情将在那里得到解决
There the matter of your witchcraft will be decided.

403
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,388
没有巫师这种东西
There are no such things as witches.

404
00:28:09,243 --> 00:28:10,520
那是亵渎
That is sacrilege.

405
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:14,424
如果他们听到你的话，他们会因为这样的想法而烧死你
If they hear you, they will burn you for such beliefs.

406
00:28:14,474 --> 00:28:16,650
只有你能听懂我的话，而那是事实
You're the only one that can hear me, and that's the truth.

407
00:28:17,008 --> 00:28:19,175
没有巫师，你为什么否认呢？
There are no witches. Why do you deny it?

408
00:28:19,853 --> 00:28:21,390
别让他们听到你的话
Do not let them hear you.

409
00:28:22,031 --> 00:28:25,695
有巫师！有！
There are witches! There are!

410
00:28:26,076 --> 00:28:29,532
你自己可能会被审判官发现是巫师
You yourself may be discovered to be a witch by the inquisitor.

411
00:28:29,969 --> 00:28:35,129
不！你在做什么？不！
No! What are you doing? No!

412
00:28:35,826 --> 00:28:37,419
帮帮我！帮帮我！
Help! Help!

413
00:28:43,775 --> 00:28:45,978
我会向审判官告发你
I'll denounce you to the inquisitor.

414
00:28:46,924 --> 00:28:49,100
你来自未来，就像我一样
You came here from the future, just as I did.

415
00:28:49,458 --> 00:28:50,654
所以你也是个巫师
Therefore, you, too, are a witch.

416
00:28:51,097 --> 00:28:53,987
我求求你，不要牵连我
I beg you, do not implicate me.

417
00:28:54,572 --> 00:28:55,728
他们会烧死我
They'd burn me.

418
00:28:55,819 --> 00:28:56,432
那就帮我
Then help me.

419
00:28:57,203 --> 00:28:59,379
我会尽我所能证明你是无辜的
I'll do everything I can to prove you innocent.

420
00:29:00,445 --> 00:29:03,261
我将驳斥所有关于巫术的指控
I will disprove all the charges of witchcraft.

421
00:29:03,386 --> 00:29:07,610
但是你绝对不能再和你身后的伙伴说话
But you must never again speak to the comrades you left behind.

422
00:29:07,955 --> 00:29:09,624
帮我回图书馆
Help me return to the library.

423
00:29:09,731 --> 00:29:11,511
我迷路了，我必须回到那里
I've lost my way. I must get back there.

424
00:29:11,751 --> 00:29:13,351
你回不去了
You cannot get back.

425
00:29:13,583 --> 00:29:14,439
我告诉你我必须回去！
I tell you I must!

426
00:29:15,557 --> 00:29:16,646
我和两个朋友一起
I had two friends with me,

427
00:29:16,927 --> 00:29:18,463
他们迷失在了另一个时期
who are lost in another time period.

428
00:29:18,718 --> 00:29:21,023
我必须找到他们，你和我们一起回去
I must find them. You'll come back with us.

429
00:29:21,287 --> 00:29:22,503
我们再也回不去了
We can never go back.

430
00:29:23,155 --> 00:29:26,488
我们必须在这里，过去，度过我们的生活
We must live out our lives here in the past.

431
00:29:27,602 --> 00:29:31,442
间时已经准备好我们的细胞结构和大脑模式
The atavachron has prepared our cell structure and brain patterns

432
00:29:32,218 --> 00:29:34,514
让这里的生活变得自然
to make life natural here.

433
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:38,482
回到未来就意味着立即死亡
To return to the future would mean instant death.

434
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:40,543
准备？
Prepare?

435
00:29:42,634 --> 00:29:43,782
我没有准备
I was not prepared.

436
00:29:44,074 --> 00:29:47,018
你的阿托兹先生没有为我做任何准备
Your Mr. Atoz did not prepare me in any way.

437
00:29:47,387 --> 00:29:48,923
那你必须马上回去
Then you must get back at once！

438
00:29:49,850 --> 00:29:51,259
如果你没有被改变
If you were not transformed,

439
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:55,931
你在过去这里只能存活几个小时
you can only survive for a few hours here in the past.

440
00:29:58,877 --> 00:30:01,501
来，快，快
Come. Hurry. Hurry.

441
00:30:08,113 --> 00:30:10,041
扎拉贝斯，你是个出色的厨师
Zarabeth, you are a beautiful cook.

442
00:30:10,855 --> 00:30:11,897
有人告诉过你吗？
Have you ever been told that?

443
00:30:12,601 --> 00:30:13,451
最近没有
Not recently.

444
00:30:14,021 --> 00:30:17,541
哦，你会发现史波克在那些事情上是非常不负责任的
Oh, well, you'll find that Spock is quite delinquent in those matters.

445
00:30:18,443 --> 00:30:19,467
我没有注意到
I hadn't noticed it.

446
00:30:21,552 --> 00:30:22,371
哦？
Oh?

447
00:30:26,589 --> 00:30:27,841
现在我感觉好多了
Well, now that I'm feeling better,

448
00:30:27,841 --> 00:30:30,529
你会注意到我们的方法有明显的不同
you'll notice a distinct difference in our approach.

449
00:30:30,767 --> 00:30:31,439
真的吗？
Really?

450
00:30:32,334 --> 00:30:33,679
这是值得期待的事情
It's something to look forward to.

451
00:30:34,146 --> 00:30:35,746
医生，你一定足够健康
I think you must be well enough, Doctor,

452
00:30:35,835 --> 00:30:38,100
能品尝这种气候所提供的几种美味了
to try the few delicacies this climate has to offer.

453
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:39,168
不，还没有
No, not yet.

454
00:30:39,911 --> 00:30:42,893
以你的进步速度，很快就行了，我能看出来
At your rate of progress, it will be soon, I can see.

455
00:30:43,387 --> 00:30:45,713
麦考伊医生正的进展非常快速
Doctor McCoy is making excellent progress.

456
00:30:46,608 --> 00:30:49,610
史波克先生一直在无证行医
And Mr. Spock has been practicing medicine without a license.

457
00:30:50,490 --> 00:30:52,874
不要让他医治你，我是这里的医生
Don't let him doctor you. I'm the doctor.

458
00:30:53,193 --> 00:30:56,905
并且被认为是企业号全体船员中最糟糕的病人
And known as the worst patient in the entire crew of the Enterprise.

459
00:30:57,955 --> 00:30:58,979
我想知道她在哪里
I wonder where she is.

460
00:31:00,998 --> 00:31:02,755
5,000年后的未来
5,000 years in the future.

461
00:31:07,222 --> 00:31:08,054
谢谢
Thank you.

462
00:31:25,047 --> 00:31:26,135
我想知道吉姆在哪里
I wonder where Jim is.

463
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:27,860
谁知道呢
Who knows.

464
00:31:29,266 --> 00:31:31,314
我们只能希望他一切安好，无论他在哪里
We can only hope that he is well, wherever he is.

465
00:31:32,364 --> 00:31:33,964
我们只能希望是什么意思？
What do you mean, we can only hope?

466
00:31:34,395 --> 00:31:35,756
你没有做点什么吗？
Haven't you done anything about it?

467
00:31:36,064 --> 00:31:37,031
可以做什么？
What was there to do?

468
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:39,341
找到传送门，不会太远
Locate the portal. It can't be too far.

469
00:31:43,717 --> 00:31:44,933
我们已经谈过这些了，医生
We've been through all that, Doctor.

470
00:31:45,513 --> 00:31:47,173
重提这个话题有什么意义呢？
What's the point of rehashing that subject?

471
00:31:47,976 --> 00:31:50,664
我们回不去了，你不明白吗？
We can't get back. Wasn't that clear to you?

472
00:31:50,872 --> 00:31:52,215
是的，我很明白
Yes, that was clear to me.

473
00:31:52,419 --> 00:31:56,520
那也许是你病得太重了，无法理解“回不去”的意思
Then perhaps you were too ill to understand what "can't get back" means.

474
00:31:57,334 --> 00:31:58,550
我不相信，史波克
I don't believe it, Spock.

475
00:31:59,909 --> 00:32:02,469
放弃尝试不像你会做的事情
It's just not like you to give up trying.

476
00:32:04,214 --> 00:32:05,252
那我再给你重复一遍
Then I'll repeat it for you.

477
00:32:06,770 --> 00:32:07,868
记在你的脑子里
Get this through your head.

478
00:32:09,155 --> 00:32:10,162
我们回不去了
We can't get back.

479
00:32:11,094 --> 00:32:13,199
这意味着我们被困在这里
That means we're trapped here,

480
00:32:13,557 --> 00:32:15,689
在这个星球的过去，就像我们现在一样
in this planet's past, just as we are.

481
00:32:16,738 --> 00:32:18,805
我们将在此度过余生
And we'll stay here for the rest of our lives.

482
00:32:19,953 --> 00:32:21,317
现在你明白了吗？
Now do you understand?

483
00:32:25,077 --> 00:32:26,165
是的，我明白了
Yes, I understand.

484
00:32:27,408 --> 00:32:31,376
我从没想过我会听到这个，但我明白了
I never thought I'd hear it, but I understand.

485
00:32:33,270 --> 00:32:34,417
你想留在这里
You want to stay here.

486
00:32:35,142 --> 00:32:39,409
事实上，你非常有理由留在这个孤独凄凉的荒野
As a matter of fact, you're highly motivated to stay in this forsaken waste.

487
00:32:41,361 --> 00:32:43,966
那个愿景刚才对你来说似乎很有吸引力
The prospect appeared quite attractive to you a moment ago.

488
00:32:44,795 --> 00:32:47,167
现在，你听我说，你这个尖耳朵的瓦肯人…
Now, you listen to me, you pointed-eared Vulcan...

489
00:32:49,731 --> 00:32:50,881
我不喜欢
I don't like that.

490
00:32:51,604 --> 00:32:53,512
我认为我从来没喜欢过，现在我很确定
I don't think I ever did and now I'm sure.

491
00:32:57,191 --> 00:32:58,682
你怎么了，史波克？
What's happening to you, Spock?

492
00:32:58,774 --> 00:33:00,374
没有什么事情是不应该在很久以前发生的
Nothing that shouldn't have happened long ago.

493
00:33:23,509 --> 00:33:24,405
很久以前…
Long ago...

494
00:33:26,057 --> 00:33:29,909
当然，很久以前
Of course. Long ago.

495
00:33:45,131 --> 00:33:46,164
这就是那个地方
This is where it is.

496
00:33:46,785 --> 00:33:48,744
我不记得确切的地点了
I can't remember the exact spot.

497
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:12,916
在那，那就是传送门
That's it. That is the portal.

498
00:34:16,578 --> 00:34:18,263
我不能再等了
I cannot wait any longer.

499
00:34:46,927 --> 00:34:48,911
史波克？麦考伊？
Spock? McCoy?

500
00:34:51,135 --> 00:34:52,056
柯克呼叫企业号，请回答
Kirk to Enterprise. Come in.

501
00:34:52,758 --> 00:34:53,557
我是斯科特，舰长
Scott here, Captain.

502
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:55,369
还有多久太阳会爆炸？
How much time before the sun blows up?

503
00:34:55,740 --> 00:34:58,656
17分钟，你们三个最好马上回来
17 minutes. You three had better come back right away.

504
00:34:59,109 --> 00:35:01,048
我们不能，斯科提，史波克和麦考伊失踪了
We can't, Scotty. Spock and McCoy are missing.

505
00:35:01,358 --> 00:35:02,539
我就知道有麻烦
I knew there was trouble.

506
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:04,218
我已经让一个登陆小队待命了
I've got a landing party standing by.

507
00:35:04,253 --> 00:35:06,153
不，任何情况下
No. Under no circumstances

508
00:35:06,253 --> 00:35:08,065
没有我的命令都不要派人到这里来
send anyone else here without my orders.

509
00:35:08,650 --> 00:35:10,706
准备以曲速离开，通话完毕
Prepare to warp out and stand by. Kirk out.

510
00:35:13,642 --> 00:35:16,746
阿托兹先生，你在哪里？
Mr. Atoz, where are you?

511
00:35:21,102 --> 00:35:21,850
我可以帮你吗？
May I help you?

512
00:35:22,404 --> 00:35:25,162
是你，你很幸运你找到了回到这里的路
It's you. You're lucky you found your way back here.

513
00:35:25,718 --> 00:35:27,437
让我通过间时处理你
Now let me process you through the atavachron.

514
00:35:27,437 --> 00:35:27,832
不
No.

515
00:35:29,554 --> 00:35:32,493
阿托兹先生，我和我的朋友们来自另一个星球
Mr. Atoz, my friends and I are from another planet.

516
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:35,136
我们不属于你们的历史
We don't belong in your history.

517
00:35:35,156 --> 00:35:36,816
我们根本不属于你们的星球
We don't belong on your planet at all.

518
00:35:36,927 --> 00:35:39,899
就让我来处理你，让你回到属于你的地方
Just let me take care of you and get you back where you belong.

519
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:40,560
不
No.

520
00:35:41,772 --> 00:35:44,484
我想找到他们之前正在查看的确切光盘
I want to find the exact disc that they were viewing.

521
00:35:45,649 --> 00:35:46,443
请你回去
Please, go back.

522
00:35:46,463 --> 00:35:47,420
对不起，阿托兹先生
I'm sorry, Mr. Atoz.

523
00:35:47,466 --> 00:35:48,577
- 拜托  - 阿托兹先生！
-Please.  - Mr. Atoz!

524
00:35:48,618 --> 00:35:49,962
我必须准备逃跑
I must prepare to escape.

525
00:35:52,727 --> 00:35:53,687
我一会就放你出去
I'll let you out in a minute.

526
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:57,078
还在玩你的复制品小游戏吗？
Still up to your little game of replicas?

527
00:35:57,098 --> 00:35:58,314
这次是哪个，是真的还是假的？
Which are you this time, real or not?

528
00:36:05,973 --> 00:36:08,341
你显然是一个有自杀倾向的疯子
You are evidently a suicidal maniac.

529
00:36:08,736 --> 00:36:10,325
我不明白你想做什么
I don't understand what you're trying to do,

530
00:36:10,629 --> 00:36:12,741
但如果你继续，我们都会死
but if you continue, both of us will die,

531
00:36:12,873 --> 00:36:14,674
而我不想死
and I for one, do not wish death.

532
00:36:15,101 --> 00:36:16,623
如果你帮我，我们就不会死
If you help me, we won't die.

533
00:36:16,623 --> 00:36:17,263
我向你承诺
I promise you that.

534
00:36:17,610 --> 00:36:18,351
我不信任你
I don't trust you.

535
00:36:18,689 --> 00:36:20,491
你现在是哪一个，复制品还是真的？
Which one are you now, the replica or the real one?

536
00:36:20,773 --> 00:36:21,899
我是真正的阿托斯
I'm the real Atoz.

537
00:36:22,272 --> 00:36:23,627
你已经拿走了我的复制品
You've done away with my replicas.

538
00:36:24,450 --> 00:36:26,744
我后悔我现在必须做的事情
I regret what I must now do.

539
00:36:28,765 --> 00:36:30,272
你不是真的想伤害我，对吗？
You don't really want to hurt me, do you?

540
00:36:31,401 --> 00:36:33,641
你一直在试图挽救我的生命，我知道
You've been trying to save my life. I realise that.

541
00:36:33,914 --> 00:36:34,810
把那东西收起来
Put that thing away.

542
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:52,068
我不能假装对你在这里感到难过
I cannot pretend to be sorry that you are here,

543
00:36:52,849 --> 00:36:55,217
尽管我意识到这对你来说是个不幸
though I realise it is a misfortune for you.

544
00:36:56,233 --> 00:36:59,123
我在这里也违背了我的意志，就像你一样
I'm here against my will too, just as you are.

545
00:37:00,843 --> 00:37:06,420
抱歉，我不知道有什么办法让你回到你自己的时间
I'm sorry. I know of no way to return you to your own time.

546
00:37:07,199 --> 00:37:08,995
我并不想回去
It's not that I wish to return.

547
00:37:09,692 --> 00:37:11,036
这就是我的时间
This is my time now.

548
00:37:12,175 --> 00:37:13,234
我不得不面对现实
I've had to face that.

549
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:15,244
但这里一直很孤独
But it has been lonely here.

550
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:19,136
你知道一个人是什么感觉吗？
Do you know what it's like to be alone?

551
00:37:20,399 --> 00:37:21,231
真的是一个人？
Really alone?

552
00:37:23,146 --> 00:37:26,666
是的，我知道是什么感觉
Yes. I know what it is like.

553
00:37:28,515 --> 00:37:29,482
我相信你知道
I believe you do.

554
00:37:34,586 --> 00:37:36,570
吃点东西吧，拜托
Have something to eat, please.

555
00:37:37,379 --> 00:37:38,554
如果你喜欢的话
If it pleases you.

556
00:37:47,775 --> 00:37:49,002
这是动物肉？
This is animal flesh?

557
00:37:49,811 --> 00:37:52,883
恐怕这附近没什么可吃的了
There's not much else to eat around here, I'm afraid.

558
00:37:53,591 --> 00:37:54,935
当然，因为气候
Naturally, because of the climate.

559
00:37:58,329 --> 00:38:00,057
避难所的热量来源是什么？
What is the source of heat in the shelter?

560
00:38:00,904 --> 00:38:02,312
有一个地下热泉
There's an underground hot spring.

561
00:38:02,696 --> 00:38:07,688
好极了，那就有可能建造一个温室
Excellent. Then it will be possible to build a greenhouse of sorts.

562
00:38:10,536 --> 00:38:14,888
同时，这将不得不作为唯一的营养来源
Meanwhile, this will have to do as the only source of nourishment.

563
00:38:34,692 --> 00:38:36,996
这里没什么可享受的东西
There aren't many luxuries around here.

564
00:38:38,422 --> 00:38:41,164
佐尔·汗只给我留下了生存所必需的东西
Zor Kahn only left me what was necessary to survive.

565
00:38:41,429 --> 00:38:43,605
但他显然打算让你继续活下去
But he evidently intended that you continue living.

566
00:38:44,482 --> 00:38:50,965
是的，他给了我武器、避难所、食物，生活所需的一切
Yes. He gave me weapons, a shelter, food. Everything I needed to live

567
00:38:52,243 --> 00:38:53,937
除了陪伴
Except companionship.

568
00:38:55,952 --> 00:38:58,064
他不希望有人说他杀了我
He did not want it said that he had me killed.

569
00:38:59,865 --> 00:39:01,046
但是把我一个人送到这里
But to send me here alone,

570
00:39:02,099 --> 00:39:04,292
如果这不都算杀人，那什么算？
if that is not death, what is?

571
00:39:07,091 --> 00:39:09,203
非常有创意的头脑，那个人
A very inventive mind, that man.

572
00:39:10,287 --> 00:39:15,238
却麻木不仁，将如此美丽的女子送去流放
But insensitive, to send such a beautiful woman into exile.

573
00:39:18,659 --> 00:39:20,928
寒冷对我的影响一定比我意识到的要大
The cold must have affected me more than I realized.

574
00:39:22,637 --> 00:39:24,433
请不要在意，我本来不是这样的
Please, pay no attention. I'm not myself.

575
00:39:26,723 --> 00:39:28,113
我行为很可耻
I'm behaving disgracefully.

576
00:39:29,506 --> 00:39:31,746
我吃了动物肉，而且我很享受
I have eaten animal flesh and I've enjoyed it.

577
00:39:33,104 --> 00:39:34,064
我是怎么了？
What is wrong with me?

578
00:39:36,783 --> 00:39:38,063
我和你说你很漂亮
I tell you you're beautiful.

579
00:39:42,696 --> 00:39:43,866
但你确实很漂亮
But you are beautiful.

580
00:39:47,271 --> 00:39:48,679
这么对你说你有错吗？
Is it so wrong to tell you so?

581
00:39:50,390 --> 00:39:52,054
我一直等着听你这么说
I have longed to hear you say it.

582
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:42,868
你很美丽
You are beautiful.

583
00:40:45,046 --> 00:40:47,414
比我所知道的任何美梦都更美
More beautiful than any dream of beauty I've ever known.

584
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:01,676
就待在原地，先生
Just stay where you are, sir.

585
00:41:01,905 --> 00:41:03,208
我会看着你到达安全的地方
I'll see you get to safety.

586
00:41:21,705 --> 00:41:24,911
现在，你要帮我找我的朋友
Now, you're going to help me look for my friends.

587
00:41:25,077 --> 00:41:26,977
你真是一个坚定的人
You're a most determined man.

588
00:41:27,241 --> 00:41:28,218
[通讯器发出哔哔声]
[COMMUNICATOR BLEEPS]

589
00:41:31,709 --> 00:41:32,339
我是柯克
Kirk here.

590
00:41:32,538 --> 00:41:34,105
[斯科特]发生什么了？你为什么要等？
[SCOTT] What's happening? Why are you waiting?

591
00:41:34,299 --> 00:41:37,275
没时间解释了，你准备好曲速离开了吗？
No time to explain. Are you ready to warp out?

592
00:41:37,535 --> 00:41:38,212
是的，长官
Aye, Captain.

593
00:41:38,502 --> 00:41:39,620
准备传送我们上去
Stand by to beam us up.

594
00:41:40,502 --> 00:41:43,341
但要是那颗恒星爆炸，不要等待
But when that star explodes, don't wait.

595
00:41:43,799 --> 00:41:44,792
快点离开，通话完毕
Get out fast. Kirk out.

596
00:41:46,832 --> 00:41:47,792
现在，我们要开始寻找
Now we're going to start looking.

597
00:41:49,102 --> 00:41:50,318
他们在冰冻的荒野中
They were in a frozen waste.

598
00:41:51,010 --> 00:41:51,970
我能听到风声
I could hear the wind.

599
00:41:53,371 --> 00:41:54,943
好的，好的
All right. All right.

600
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:59,559
那一定是5000年前萨佩顿的冰河时代
It must be the Sarpeidon Ice Age, 5,000 years ago.

601
00:42:00,118 --> 00:42:01,142
让我看看
Let me look.

602
00:42:01,406 --> 00:42:03,262
我们一起看，阿托兹先生
We'll both look, Mr. Atoz.

603
00:42:10,077 --> 00:42:10,960
史波克
Spock.

604
00:42:13,876 --> 00:42:15,806
你对我不诚实，史波克
You've been dishonest with me, Spock,

605
00:42:16,315 --> 00:42:18,310
对你来说这也是新鲜事
and that is also something new for you.

606
00:42:18,687 --> 00:42:20,031
我已经告诉你事实了，医生
I've given you the facts, Doctor.

607
00:42:20,335 --> 00:42:21,759
你所知道的事实
The facts as you know them.

608
00:42:23,663 --> 00:42:25,836
还是你只是接受了扎拉贝斯的说法
Or did you just accept Zarabeth's word

609
00:42:25,836 --> 00:42:27,820
因为那是你想相信的？
because it's what you wanted to believe?

610
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:29,164
告诉你的就是真相
You were told the truth.

611
00:42:30,090 --> 00:42:32,721
如果扎拉贝斯是消息源，那有什么区别？
If Zarabeth is the source, what's the difference?

612
00:42:33,153 --> 00:42:36,690
扎拉贝斯是一个注定要过着可怕的孤独生活的女人
Zarabeth is a woman condemned to a terrible life of loneliness.

613
00:42:37,163 --> 00:42:39,442
她愿意对任何人做任何事来改变这一点
She would do anything to change that.

614
00:42:40,578 --> 00:42:41,463
不是吗，扎拉贝斯？
Wouldn't you, Zarabeth?

615
00:42:41,845 --> 00:42:43,317
我把我知道的都告诉了你
I told you what I know.

616
00:42:43,945 --> 00:42:44,652
是吗？
Did you?

617
00:42:45,356 --> 00:42:47,532
你说我们回不去了
You said we can't get back.

618
00:42:47,941 --> 00:42:49,861
事实是你回不去了
The truth is you can't get back.

619
00:42:50,914 --> 00:42:53,066
她不会危及其他人的生命
She would not jeopardize other lives.

620
00:42:53,332 --> 00:42:55,690
她愿意做任何事来阻止那种孤独的生活
She would do anything to prevent that life of loneliness.

621
00:42:56,490 --> 00:42:58,218
她会说谎，她会作弊
She would lie. She would cheat.

622
00:42:58,672 --> 00:42:59,956
她甚至会谋杀我
She would even murder me,

623
00:43:00,363 --> 00:43:02,448
舰长，企业号的全体船员
the captain, the entire crew of the Enterprise,

624
00:43:03,270 --> 00:43:04,758
让你和她在一起在这里
to keep you here with her.

625
00:43:07,688 --> 00:43:11,272
说吧，扎拉贝斯，告诉史波克真相
Go ahead, Zarabeth. Tell Spock the truth.

626
00:43:12,938 --> 00:43:13,704
说啊
Go ahead.

627
00:43:14,999 --> 00:43:16,663
告诉史波克你会杀人！
Tell Spock you would kill!

628
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:17,837
你要对她做什么？
What are you doing to her?

629
00:43:23,279 --> 00:43:25,065
你是想杀了我吗，史波克？
Are you trying to kill me, Spock?

630
00:43:29,327 --> 00:43:30,856
这真的是你想要的吗？
Is that what you really want?

631
00:43:32,940 --> 00:43:34,844
想想！你有什么感觉？
Think! What are you feeling?

632
00:43:35,371 --> 00:43:36,716
愤怒？妒忌？
Rage? Jealousy?

633
00:43:37,552 --> 00:43:39,216
你以前有过这些感觉吗？
Have you ever had those feelings before?

634
00:43:42,048 --> 00:43:46,204
这是不可能的，不可能
This is impossible. Impossible.

635
00:43:48,445 --> 00:43:49,430
我是瓦肯人
I'm a Vulcan.

636
00:43:50,220 --> 00:43:54,060
你认识的瓦肯人在未来的5000年后才出现
The Vulcan you knew won't exist for another 5,000 years.

637
00:43:55,498 --> 00:43:59,274
想想吧，兄弟，此时此刻你们的星球上正在发生什么？
Think, man. What's happening on your planet right now, this very moment?

638
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:03,170
我的祖先是野蛮人
My ancestors are barbarians.

639
00:44:04,653 --> 00:44:06,136
好战的野蛮人
Warlike barbarians.

640
00:44:06,696 --> 00:44:09,896
他们几乎用自己的激情杀死了自己
Who nearly killed themselves off with their own passions.

641
00:44:11,577 --> 00:44:15,856
史波克，你正在退化成你的祖先
Spock, you're reverting into your ancestors

642
00:44:16,999 --> 00:44:19,581
在你出生前5000年！
5,000 years before you were born!

643
00:44:23,269 --> 00:44:24,485
我已经迷失了自己
I've lost myself.

644
00:44:27,636 --> 00:44:28,980
我不知道我是谁
I do not know who I am.

645
00:44:48,927 --> 00:44:49,778
我们可以回去吗？
Can we go back?

646
00:44:54,556 --> 00:44:55,506
我不知道
I don't know.

647
00:44:58,517 --> 00:45:01,077
我只知道我回不去了
I only know that I can't go back.

648
00:45:03,254 --> 00:45:05,126
我知道我会尝试，史波克
I know I'm going to try, Spock,

649
00:45:06,683 --> 00:45:08,730
因为我的生活在那里
because my life is back there.

650
00:45:10,468 --> 00:45:11,812
而我想要那样的生活
And I want that life.

651
00:45:45,033 --> 00:45:46,280
你觉得那是对的吗？
Do you think that's the right one?

652
00:45:46,359 --> 00:45:46,984
我不知道
I don't know.

653
00:45:47,214 --> 00:45:50,856
如果我们要设置通往正确时期的传送门，你必须得具体
If we're to get the portal set for the proper time period, you must be specific.

654
00:45:50,930 --> 00:45:51,655
我没看到
I didn't see it.

655
00:45:51,715 --> 00:45:52,807
试着喊一下
Try calling out.

656
00:45:54,262 --> 00:45:58,870
老骨头？史波克！麦考伊！
Bones? Spock! McCoy!

657
00:46:01,481 --> 00:46:02,396
你找错了
You've got the wrong one.

658
00:46:02,534 --> 00:46:04,868
拜托，时间不多了，让我走
Please, there's no time left. Let me go.

659
00:46:04,910 --> 00:46:05,554
再试一次
Try again.

660
00:46:12,521 --> 00:46:14,643
这里没有传送门，医生，没有希望了
There's no portal here, Doctor. It's hopeless.

661
00:46:15,342 --> 00:46:16,437
我想你是对的
I suppose you're right.

662
00:46:16,459 --> 00:46:18,891
你病得太厉害了，不能再待在这里了，放弃吧
You're too ill to remain out here. Give it up.

663
00:46:27,964 --> 00:46:30,341
老骨头，史波克！
Bones. Spock!

664
00:46:31,675 --> 00:46:33,801
是吉姆，我们来了，吉姆！
It's Jim. Here we are, Jim!

665
00:46:34,986 --> 00:46:35,657
我找到了他们
I've found them.

666
00:46:37,209 --> 00:46:38,297
你还能听到我说话吗？
Can you still hear me?

667
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:40,601
我们听得一清二楚，舰长！
We hear you perfectly, Captain!

668
00:46:42,444 --> 00:46:43,545
跟着我的声音！
Follow my voice!

669
00:46:45,299 --> 00:46:47,576
史波克，麦考伊，跟着我的声音
Spock, McCoy, follow my voice.

670
00:46:48,150 --> 00:46:49,723
你们听到我了吗？继续跟着我的声音
Do you hear me? Keep following my voice.

671
00:46:49,946 --> 00:46:51,998
史波克，麦考伊
Spock. McCoy. 

672
00:46:52,528 --> 00:46:53,666
一定是这里
This must be it.

673
00:46:54,712 --> 00:46:55,928
你们在等什么？快点
What are you waiting for? Hurry.

674
00:47:02,758 --> 00:47:03,923
走吧，史波克！
Come on, Spock!

675
00:47:05,580 --> 00:47:06,988
你先走，医生！
You start ahead, Doctor!

676
00:47:10,630 --> 00:47:12,102
我不想和你分开
I do not wish to part from you.

677
00:47:13,436 --> 00:47:17,516
我不能去，如果我回去，我会死
I cannot come. If I go back, I will die.

678
00:47:18,806 --> 00:47:19,946
你在等什么？快点！
What are you waiting for? Hurry!

679
00:47:21,204 --> 00:47:22,566
我们有多少时间？
How much time do we have?

680
00:47:24,810 --> 00:47:25,834
斯科提，还有多少时间？
Scotty, how much time is there?

681
00:47:25,905 --> 00:47:27,453
你们现在就得上船
You've got to come aboard now.

682
00:47:43,224 --> 00:47:44,056
出问题了
Something's wrong.

683
00:47:47,380 --> 00:47:48,596
怎么了？为什么他通不过？
What's the matter? Why can't he get through?

684
00:47:48,628 --> 00:47:49,375
我不知道
I don't know.

685
00:47:49,499 --> 00:47:52,827
除非，是因为他们原本是一起通过传送门的
Unless, it's because they originally went through the portal together.

686
00:47:53,632 --> 00:47:54,683
史波克，麦考伊
Spock, McCoy,

687
00:47:55,159 --> 00:47:57,589
除非你们同时回来，否则你无法通过
you can't get through unless you both come back at the same time.

688
00:47:58,935 --> 00:47:59,575
斯科提
Scotty

689
00:47:59,697 --> 00:48:01,484
不管有没有命令，我要先把你传送上来
Orders or no, I'm beaming you up first.

690
00:48:01,778 --> 00:48:02,689
不！等等！
No! Wait!

691
00:48:05,232 --> 00:48:08,240
史波克，麦考伊，快点穿过传送门！时间不多了！
Spock, McCoy, hurry through the portal! Time is running out!

692
00:48:48,361 --> 00:48:50,089
他已经计划好了逃跑，我很高兴他做到了
He had his escape planned. I'm glad he made it.

693
00:48:54,964 --> 00:48:55,924
柯克呼叫企业号
Kirk to Enterprise.

694
00:48:59,087 --> 00:49:01,135
没有必要再观察我了，医生
There's no further need to observe me, Doctor.

695
00:49:02,078 --> 00:49:05,150
正如你所看到的，我在各个方面都回到了现在
As you can see, I've returned to the present in every sense.

696
00:49:06,349 --> 00:49:07,798
但它确实发生过，史波克
But it did happen, Spock.

697
00:49:08,969 --> 00:49:09,974
是的，它发生过
Yes, it happened.

698
00:49:11,448 --> 00:49:13,300
但那是5000年前的事了
But that was 5,000 years ago.

699
00:49:15,011 --> 00:49:16,449
而她现在已经死了
And she is dead now.

700
00:49:16,781 --> 00:49:20,621
很久以前就死了，入土了
Dead and buried. Long ago.

701
00:49:21,412 --> 00:49:22,372
斯科提，你在吗？
Scotty, are you there?

702
00:49:22,442 --> 00:49:23,786
再不走来不及了，舰长
It's now or never, Captain.

703
00:49:23,929 --> 00:49:24,746
传送我们上船
Beam us aboard

704
00:49:25,623 --> 00:49:27,799
我们一旦到达就进入最大曲速，通话完毕
and go to maximum warp as soon as we're there. Kirk out.
