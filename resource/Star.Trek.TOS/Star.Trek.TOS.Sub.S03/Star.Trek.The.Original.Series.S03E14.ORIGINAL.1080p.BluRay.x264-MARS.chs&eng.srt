[柯克] 舰长日志，星历5718.3
[Kirk] Captain's Log : Star date 5718.3.

2
00:00:07,918 --> 00:00:12,890
企业号正在绕着厄尔巴二号飞行，这是一颗大气有毒的行星…
The Enterprise is orbiting Elba 11, a planet with a poisonous atmosphere ...

3
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:14,850
联邦在此建立了一个收容所
where the Federation maintains an asylum...

4
00:00:15,074 --> 00:00:19,807
收治了银河系中少数几个不可救药的犯罪狂人
for the few remaining incorrigible, criminally insane of the galaxy.

5
00:00:19,879 --> 00:00:23,110
我们正在为他们带来革命性的新药
We are bringing a revolutionary new medicine to them,

6
00:00:23,182 --> 00:00:27,585
联邦希望用它永久消除…
a medicine with which the Federation hopes to eliminate mental illness...

7
00:00:27,653 --> 00:00:28,783
精神疾病
for all time.

8
00:00:29,655 --> 00:00:31,432
我正和史波克先生一起传送下去
I am transporting down with Mr. Spock,

9
00:00:31,432 --> 00:00:34,751
把药送给唐纳德·科里医生
and we're delivering the medicine to Dr. Donald Cory,

10
00:00:34,827 --> 00:00:36,412
他是殖民地主管
the governor of the colony.

11
00:00:36,929 --> 00:00:38,899
我是唐纳德，很高兴见到你
Donald, good to see you.

12
00:00:39,006 --> 00:00:39,812
主管
Governor.

13
00:00:39,965 --> 00:00:42,360
先生们，你们不知道我有多开心
Gentlemen, you don't know what a treat this is for me.

14
00:00:42,935 --> 00:00:45,501
我已经很久没有访客了，吉姆
It's been too long since I've had company, Jim.

15
00:00:46,939 --> 00:00:48,873
力场恢复原位
The force field's back in place now.

16
00:00:48,941 --> 00:00:50,875
这意味着你俩被困在这里了
That means you two are trapped here.

17
00:00:50,943 --> 00:00:54,131
我不接受你不和我一起吃饭的借口
I'm not accepting any excuses for your not dining with me.

18
00:00:54,297 --> 00:00:55,978
我们会很高兴的
We'd be delighted.

19
00:00:56,048 --> 00:00:58,915
主管，自从我们上次访问以后，你又收治了一名病人
Governor, you indicated one additional inmate since our last visit,

20
00:00:58,985 --> 00:01:00,919
总共15个，对吗？
making a total of 15. Is it correct?

21
00:01:00,987 --> 00:01:01,930
是的
It is.

22
00:01:02,467 --> 00:01:05,855
康复计划进展得不太好
The rehabilitation program isn't progressing too well,

23
00:01:06,264 --> 00:01:10,019
我怀疑这种药的有效性
and I have my doubts about the effectiveness of this medicine too.

24
00:01:10,355 --> 00:01:12,273
唐纳德，你变成悲观主义者了吗？
Donald, are you becoming a pessimist?

25
00:01:12,273 --> 00:01:14,226
我恐怕是的
I'm afraid I have.

26
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:17,599
数十亿人里总共有15个无法治愈的疯子…
A total of 15 incurably insane out of billions...

27
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:19,816
要我说并不多
is not what I would call an excessive figure.

28
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:21,184
新病人是谁？
Who is the new inmate?

29
00:01:21,184 --> 00:01:22,104
呃，加斯
Uh, Garth.

30
00:01:26,285 --> 00:01:27,551
[科里] 伊扎尔的加斯
[Cory] Garth of Izar,

31
00:01:27,618 --> 00:01:30,159
一位以前的星际舰队舰长
a former star ship fleet captain.

32
00:01:30,414 --> 00:01:35,503
当我还是学院的学员时，他的功绩是必读的
When I was a cadet at the academy, his exploits were required reading.

33
00:01:35,503 --> 00:01:38,529
他是我的英雄之一，我想见他
He was one of my heroes. I'd like to see him.

34
00:01:38,609 --> 00:01:39,352
当然
Of course.

35
00:01:41,265 --> 00:01:43,233
[开门]
[Door Opens]

00:01:50,704 --> 00:01:51,356

[咔嗒声]
[Click]

38
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:00,881
舰长！
Captain!

39
00:02:02,276 --> 00:02:03,425
你正在犯一个错误
You're making a mistake.

40
00:02:03,425 --> 00:02:06,394
柯克舰长时间紧迫，玛塔
Captain Kirk is pressed for time at the moment, Marta.

41
00:02:07,411 --> 00:02:08,807
我没有什么问题！
There's nothing the matter with me!

42
00:02:09,329 --> 00:02:13,026
你不能看着我就明白吗？你不能通过听来判断吗？
Can't you see just by looking at me? Can't you tell by listening?

43
00:02:13,205 --> 00:02:14,972
她听起来很理性，舰长
She sounds rational enough, Captain.

44
00:02:15,335 --> 00:02:17,309
我是理性的
I am rational.

45
00:02:17,591 --> 00:02:18,743
你想告诉我什么？
What is it you want to tell me?

46
00:02:20,991 --> 00:02:22,602
我不能在他面前告诉你
I can't tell you in front of him.

47
00:02:23,395 --> 00:02:25,441
你害怕在科里主管面前说话？
You're afraid to talk in front of Governor Cory?

48
00:02:26,745 --> 00:02:29,701
他根本不是真的科里主管，就是这样
He isn't really Governor Cory at all, that's just it.

49
00:02:30,248 --> 00:02:32,575
[轻笑] 这几天她一直在说
[Chuckles] She's been saying that for days now.

50
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:35,310
我们的医务人员无法弄清楚原因[轻笑]
Our medical staff can't figure out why. [Chuckles]

51
00:02:48,658 --> 00:02:49,719
这是加斯
Here's Garth.

52
00:02:50,435 --> 00:02:52,366
他异常不安
He's been unusually disturbed,

53
00:02:52,586 --> 00:02:55,919
我们不得不施加额外的限制
and we've had to impose additional restraint.

54
00:02:57,045 --> 00:02:57,889
科里？
Cory?

55
00:02:57,889 --> 00:02:58,754
[呼气]
[Exhales]

56
00:02:59,052 --> 00:03:01,711
是的，吉姆，我是科里
Yes, Jim, I'm Cory.

57
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:04,727
[疯狂地笑]
[Laughing Maniacally]

58
00:03:05,087 --> 00:03:07,656
这是真的，他骗了你
It's true. He tricked you.

59
00:03:08,193 --> 00:03:10,213
[笑]
[Laughing]

61
00:03:17,961 --> 00:03:21,822
你说你想见我，舰长，嗯，我在这里
You said you wanted to see me, Captain. Well, here I am.

62
00:03:22,078 --> 00:03:23,727
[加斯笑]
[Garth Laughing]

63
00:03:37,745 --> 00:03:40,805
[柯克] 宇宙，最后的边疆
[Kirk] Space, the final frontier.

64
00:03:46,521 --> 00:03:49,667
这些是星舰企业号的航程
These are the voyages of the star ship Enterprise.

65
00:03:50,677 --> 00:03:54,398
它的五年任务：探索未知的新世界
Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds,

66
00:03:54,845 --> 00:03:58,804
寻找新生命和新文明
to seek out new life and new civilizations,

67
00:03:58,936 --> 00:04:01,749
勇踏前人未至之境
to boldly go where no man has gone before.

68
00:04:34,632 --> 00:04:37,330
上帝毁灭之人
Whom Gods Destroy

69
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:49,793
你的瓦肯朋友还活着，舰长
Your Vulcan friend is still alive, Captain.

70
00:04:49,858 --> 00:04:52,603
我的相位枪设置为击晕，而不是击杀
My phaser was set to stun, not to kill.

71
00:04:52,812 --> 00:04:54,785
他会很舒服
He'll be quite comfortable,

72
00:04:54,851 --> 00:04:57,628
几乎和你以及我们尊敬的主管一样舒适
almost as comfortable as you and our esteemed governor.

73
00:05:00,359 --> 00:05:02,183
加斯，必须让他受罪吗？
Garth, do you have to make him suffer like that?

74
00:05:02,304 --> 00:05:04,576
用我的正式头衔称呼我，柯克
You will address me by my proper title, Kirk.

75
00:05:05,079 --> 00:05:07,191
对不起，我应该说加斯舰长
I'm sorry. I should've said Captain Garth.

76
00:05:07,714 --> 00:05:10,972
我是加斯勋爵，以前是伊扎尔的
I am Lord Garth, formerly of Izar,

77
00:05:11,193 --> 00:05:13,446
我领导着宇宙未来的主人
and I lead the future masters of the universe.

78
00:05:13,969 --> 00:05:16,764
对不起，加斯勋爵
I'm sorry, Lord Garth.

79
00:05:17,388 --> 00:05:19,841
你们地球人是一群顽固的人，不是吗？
You Earth people are a stiff-necked lot, aren't you?

80
00:05:24,726 --> 00:05:25,988
放开他
Release him.

81
00:05:26,317 --> 00:05:29,252
恐怕打倒你还不够
I'm afraid that subjugating you won't be enough.

82
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,288
你必须被监禁
You must be confined.

83
00:05:31,355 --> 00:05:35,314
以及银河系所有不屈服于我的意志的的人
And all the people of the galaxy who will not bow to my will...

84
00:05:35,392 --> 00:05:38,589
都必须被监禁或毁灭
must be confined or destroyed.

85
00:05:38,662 --> 00:05:41,790
加斯舰长，听我说
Captain Garth, listen to me.

86
00:05:41,865 --> 00:05:45,665
嗬嗬！我们敬爱的主管决定向我们发表讲话
Ho-ho! Our beloved governor has decided to address us,

87
00:05:45,736 --> 00:05:48,830
我们还没有允许他说话
and we have not given him our permission to speak.

88
00:05:48,906 --> 00:05:52,034
你这么怕他，以至于你必须让他闭嘴？
Are you so afraid of him that you must keep him pinned?

89
00:05:55,805 --> 00:05:57,784
[咔嗒声]
[Click]

90
00:05:58,541 --> 00:06:03,535
我不怕任何人，你们都没有力量反对我
I'm afraid of no one. You're all powerless against me.

91
00:06:04,064 --> 00:06:05,847
谢谢，你对药做了什么？
Thank you.

92
00:06:07,017 --> 00:06:09,251
你对药做了什么？
What've you done with the medicine?

93
00:06:09,251 --> 00:06:10,544
药？
The medicine?

94
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,077
你是说毒药，我摧毁了它
You mean the poison. I destroyed it.

95
00:06:12,077 --> 00:06:12,817
毁了？
Destroyed it?

96
00:06:12,817 --> 00:06:13,492
这是你唯一的希望
It was your only hope!

97
00:06:13,492 --> 00:06:14,260
安静！
Silence!

98
00:06:14,827 --> 00:06:17,627
弱者的喋喋不休让我厌烦
The chatter of inferior weaklings wearies me.

99
00:06:18,173 --> 00:06:22,324
是时候我来接管企业号了，当然，你会帮助我的
And it's time I took command of the Enterprise. You'll help me, of course.

100
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:24,475
当然
Of course.

101
00:06:24,668 --> 00:06:26,602
我的船员叛变了
My crew mutinied.

102
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:30,367
首先我要用企业号去追捕
The first use I will make of the Enterprise is to hunt them down...

103
00:06:30,761 --> 00:06:32,408
并惩罚他们
and punish them for that.

104
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:34,397
企业号的船员也会叛变
The crew of the Enterprise will also mutiny.

105
00:06:34,529 --> 00:06:36,513
[轻笑] 但他们不会
[Chuckles] But they won't.

106
00:06:37,703 --> 00:06:40,609
你看，舰长，我掌握了一个有用的技巧
You see, Captain, there's a helpful technique I've mastered.

107
00:06:41,351 --> 00:06:44,787
[笑]
[Laughing]

108
00:06:48,385 --> 00:06:49,392

[Laughing]

109
00:06:49,392 --> 00:06:51,192

Governor Cory, how do you feel?

113
00:07:05,629 --> 00:07:09,184
好的，我们任何人都没有办法
All right. There is no help for any of us...

114
00:07:09,258 --> 00:07:12,750
如果那个疯子是企业号的指挥官
if that madman is in command of the Enterprise.

115
00:07:12,828 --> 00:07:17,054
他吹嘘自己创造了宇宙中最强大的爆炸物
He boasts that he's created the most powerful explosive in the universe,

116
00:07:17,466 --> 00:07:18,680
我相信他
and I believe him.

117
00:07:19,197 --> 00:07:21,597
他是如何随意变换形态的？
How does he manage to change form at will?

118
00:07:21,666 --> 00:07:26,204
安托斯人教他细胞变形技术
The people of Antos taught him the techniques of cellular metamorphosis...

119
00:07:26,471 --> 00:07:29,406
来修复他身体被毁坏的部分
to restore the destroyed parts of his body.

120
00:07:29,774 --> 00:07:33,410
后来他自己学会了用这种技术
By himself, he later learned to use the technique...

121
00:07:33,478 --> 00:07:37,141
把自己变成他想要的任何样子
to recreate himself into any form he wished.

122
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:40,742
我们第一次知道是当一名警卫
The first time we knew about it was when a guard,

123
00:07:40,819 --> 00:07:45,051
在加斯的牢房里看到了以为是我的人，然后放了他
seeing what he thought was me in Garth's cell, released him.

124
00:07:49,278 --> 00:07:51,936
他真是个天才，多么浪费
He was such a genius. What a waste.

125
00:07:53,628 --> 00:07:54,686
力场开启，好的
Force field is off. Good.

126
00:07:54,686 --> 00:07:56,862
在我下达命令之前，留在这里不要被人看到
Remain here out of sight until I give the order to join me.

我是斯科特，长官
Scott here, sir.

130
00:08:07,248 --> 00:08:08,144

Beam me aboard.

是的，长官，女王到女王三级
Aye, sir. Queen to queen's level three.

132
00:08:11,142 --> 00:08:12,788
我说了传送我上船
I said beam me aboard.

133
00:08:12,788 --> 00:08:14,534
我说女王到女王三级
I said, queen to queen's level three.

134
00:08:14,653 --> 00:08:18,421
我们没有时间解决国际象棋问题，传送我上船
We have no time for chess problems. Beam me aboard!

135
00:08:21,819 --> 00:08:24,883
我正在遵守你的命令，舰长，女王到女王三级
I'm following your orders, Captain. Queen to queen's level three.

136
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:30,692
只是测试，稍后与你联系
Just testing. Be in touch with you later.

137
00:08:36,243 --> 00:08:38,177
不！
No!

[尖叫]

143
00:09:18,647 --> 00:09:22,140
我给了他暗号，他为什么不给我暗号？
I gave him the sign. Why didn't he give me the countersign?

144
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:24,113
有问题
Something's wrong.

145
00:09:24,182 --> 00:09:27,242
用国际象棋问题是舰长自己的建议
Using the chess problem was the captain's own suggestion.

146
00:09:27,318 --> 00:09:29,873
他不可能忘记，我不相信他在测试我
He couldn't have forgotten it, and I can't believe he was testing me.

147
00:09:30,258 --> 00:09:32,621
上尉，重新建立通讯
Lieutenant, re-establish communication.

148

没有回应，斯科特先生
There's no response, Mr. Scott.

151
00:09:39,278 --> 00:09:41,929
立刻派一支武装特遣队去传送室
Send an armed detail to the transporter room immediately.

152
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,089
是的，长官
Aye, aye, sir.

153
00:09:49,517 --> 00:09:51,007
苏鲁先生
Mr. Sulu,

154
00:09:51,473 --> 00:09:53,236
你的传感器显示什么？
what do your sensors show?

155
00:09:53,311 --> 00:09:56,803
我们不能传送任何人下去，一个力场正在运行
We can't beam anybody down. The force field is in full operation,

156
00:09:56,881 --> 00:10:00,205
并且所有进入庇护所的交通方式都被封锁了
and all forms of transport into the asylum dome are blocked off.

157
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:02,644
那我们可以炸开一条通过力场的路
Well, we could blast our way through the field,

158
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,746
但冒着摧毁船长，史波克先生…
but only at the risk of destroying the captain, Mr. Spock...

159
00:10:05,823 --> 00:10:07,814
和厄尔巴二号上其他生物的风险
and any other living thing on Elba ll.

160
00:10:09,155 --> 00:10:11,926
我们为何强大到足以毁灭一个星球…
How can we be powerful enough to wipe out a planet...

161
00:10:11,926 --> 00:10:13,398
却还是那么无助？
and still be so helpless?

162
00:10:23,643 --> 00:10:26,908
我们将带走企业号
We are going to take the Enterprise,

163
00:10:27,602 --> 00:10:29,038
你听到我了吗？
do you hear me?

164
00:10:30,116 --> 00:10:32,641
我们要带走她…
We are going to take her...

165
00:10:32,719 --> 00:10:37,151
哪怕我得打碎柯克舰长身上的每一根骨头
if I have to shatter every bone in Captain Kirk's body.

166
00:10:43,529 --> 00:10:45,656
舰长？
Captain?

167
00:10:45,732 --> 00:10:47,666
柯克舰长？
Captain Kirk?

168
00:10:50,403 --> 00:10:52,882
我希望你没有很难受，舰长
I hope you haven't been too uncomfortable, Captain.

169
00:10:52,882 --> 00:10:54,366
我感谢你的关心
Thank you for your concern.

170
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,248
总的来说，还是比较安逸的
All in all, it's been rather restful.

171
00:10:56,248 --> 00:10:57,307
好的
Good.

172
00:10:57,377 --> 00:11:00,813
不过，作为东道主，我恐怕还是失职了
Still, I've been quite remiss in my duties as your host.

173
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,075
你可能记得我确实邀请你吃饭了
I did invite you to dinner, as you may recall.

174
00:11:03,149 --> 00:11:04,645
我忘记了
I've forgotten.

175
00:11:04,645 --> 00:11:06,312
但我没有
But I haven't.

176
00:11:06,386 --> 00:11:08,320
你和史波克先生会是我的客人
You and Mr. Spock are to be my guests.

177
00:11:08,812 --> 00:11:10,107
史波克先生在哪里？
Where is Mr. Spock?

178
00:11:10,107 --> 00:11:12,290
就在这儿，玛塔！
Right here. Marta!

179
00:11:18,797 --> 00:11:22,627
为什么我不能只炸掉他的一只耳朵？
Why can't I blow off Just one of his ears?

180
00:11:22,702 --> 00:11:26,978
别闹了，史波克先生会认为我们不热情好客的
Stop that, Marta. Mr. Spock will think we're lacking in hospitality.

181
00:11:27,538 --> 00:11:29,154
你不加入我们吗，舰长？
Won't you join us, Captain?

182
00:11:32,288 --> 00:11:33,380
你好吗，史波克先生？
How are you, Mr. Spock?

183
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:35,374
确实很好，谢谢，舰长
Very well, indeed. Thank you, Captain.

184
00:11:35,845 --> 00:11:37,690
科里主管不加入我们吗？
Isn't Governor Cory joining us?

185
00:11:37,764 --> 00:11:40,130
主管似乎不在客人名单上
The governor doesn't seem to be on the guest list.

186
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,997
哦？疏忽？
Oh? An oversight?

187
00:11:42,069 --> 00:11:44,594
有意的，呃，主管在禁食
An intentional one. Uh, the governor's fasting.

188
00:11:44,671 --> 00:11:46,969
那样的话，我们必须谢绝
In that case, we must decline with thanks.

189
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,531
呃，舰长
Uh, Captain.

190
00:11:49,971 --> 00:11:53,307
别傻了，吉姆，跟着他走
Don't be a fool, Jim. Go along with him.

191
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:57,840
好建议，主管，嗯，舰长？
Good advice, Governor. Well, Captain?

192
00:11:58,152 --> 00:12:00,853
你会发现我们摆了一张漂亮的桌子
You'll find we set a handsome table.

193
00:12:01,175 --> 00:12:03,788
而且表演非常有趣
And the entertainment is most enjoyable.

194
00:12:05,209 --> 00:12:06,841
你很会说服人
You're very persuasive.

195
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:10,737
对，我当然是
Yes, I am. I certainly am.

196
00:12:12,984 --> 00:12:14,311
咦 哈！
Yah-haw!

197
00:12:14,311 --> 00:12:16,044
[全笑]
[Laughter]

198
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:19,089
[笑]
[Laughing]

199
00:12:26,938 --> 00:12:28,945
你的手别碰柯克！
Keep your hands off Kirk!

200
00:12:29,657 --> 00:12:32,705
你这个花心的东西！  [笑]
You treacherous thing! [Laughing]

201
00:12:32,705 --> 00:12:34,357
你嫉妒了
You're jealous!

202
00:12:34,357 --> 00:12:36,694
我才不是那种人
I am above that sort of thing.

203
00:12:37,008 --> 00:12:39,743
你的殷勤惹恼了舰长，仅此而已
The captain is annoyed by your attentions, that's all.

204
00:12:41,445 --> 00:12:43,709
亲爱的，我惹恼你了吗？
Am I annoying you, dearest?

205
00:12:43,781 --> 00:12:45,104
呃，并没有
Uh, not really.

206
00:12:45,104 --> 00:12:46,443
[轻笑]
[Chuckles]

207
00:12:46,517 --> 00:12:50,886
他觉得我很迷人，而你对此很不安，承认吧
He finds me fascinating and you're bothered by it. Admit it.

208
00:12:50,955 --> 00:12:53,321
我可以把你打死
I may have you beaten to death.

209
00:12:53,391 --> 00:12:54,733
不，你不会的
No, you won't,

210
00:12:55,013 --> 00:12:58,163
因为我是这个星球上最美丽的女人
because I am the most beautiful woman on this planet.

211
00:12:58,496 --> 00:13:01,171
你是唯一的女人，你这蠢婆娘
You're the only woman on this planet, you stupid cow.

212
00:13:01,599 --> 00:13:04,090
嗯，我是这个星系里最美丽的女人！
Well, I'm the most beautiful woman in this galaxy!

213
00:13:04,168 --> 00:13:05,455
你令人厌恶！
You're repulsive!

214
00:13:05,455 --> 00:13:07,119
我很美丽！
I'm beautiful!

215
00:13:07,513 --> 00:13:09,447
而且我也很聪明
And I'm intelligent too.

216
00:13:09,777 --> 00:13:11,711
我写诗
I write poetry,

217
00:13:11,779 --> 00:13:14,339
我画绝美的图画
and I paint marvellous pictures.

218
00:13:14,414 --> 00:13:17,281
而且我是一个很棒的舞者
And I am a wonderful dancer.

219
00:13:17,351 --> 00:13:20,411
胡说，一派胡言！
Lies! All lies!

220
00:13:20,487 --> 00:13:23,581
你是我见过的最大的骗子
You are the greatest liar I have ever met!

221
00:13:23,657 --> 00:13:25,958
让我听一首你写的诗
Let me hear one poem you've written.

222
00:13:27,305 --> 00:13:28,956
如你所愿
If you like.

223
00:13:30,063 --> 00:13:32,531
[轻声地] 舰长，如果你能转移注意力
[Softly] Captain, if you could create a diversion,

224
00:13:32,531 --> 00:13:35,591
我也许能找到控制室并打开力场
I might be able to find the control room and open the forcefield.

225
00:13:35,669 --> 00:13:39,105
我们只需要几秒钟，如果斯科提已经通知了警卫
All we need is a few seconds, if Scotty has alerted security.

226
00:13:39,173 --> 00:13:42,233
先生们，尊重一下演员
Gentlemen, courtesy for the performer.

227
00:13:44,912 --> 00:13:47,640
“我怎么能够把你来比作夏天？
"Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?

228
00:13:47,711 --> 00:13:50,407
“你不独比它可爱也比它温婉
"Thou art more lovely and more temperate.

229
00:13:50,756 --> 00:13:53,847
“狂风把五月宠爱的娇蕊作践
"Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,

230
00:13:53,917 --> 00:13:55,812
夏天出赁的期限…”
and summer's lease hath all... "

231
00:13:55,812 --> 00:13:57,375
你写的？
You wrote that?

232
00:13:57,454 --> 00:13:59,251
昨天，事实上
Yesterday, as a matter of fact.

233
00:13:59,322 --> 00:14:02,086
它是一位名叫莎士比亚的地球人写的…
It was written by an Earth man named Shakespeare...

234
00:14:02,158 --> 00:14:03,789
很久以前！
a long time ago!

235
00:14:03,993 --> 00:14:07,257
这并没有改变我昨天又写了一遍的事实
Which does not alter the fact that I wrote it again yesterday!

236
00:14:08,312 --> 00:14:11,423
我认为这是我最好的诗之一，不是吗？
I think it's one of my best poems, don't you?

237
00:14:12,836 --> 00:14:15,248
我可以赤手空拳地杀了你！
I may kill you with my bare hands!

238
00:14:15,248 --> 00:14:16,272
啊！
Aah!

239
00:14:19,609 --> 00:14:22,009
事实上，舰长，她是个一流的舞者
Actually, Captain, she is a superb dancer.

240
00:14:22,078 --> 00:14:25,309
玛塔，亲爱的，你不为我们的客人跳舞吗？
Marta, my dear, won't you dance for our guests?

241
00:14:26,783 --> 00:14:29,013
那不是请求
That was not a request.

242
00:14:53,977 --> 00:14:56,036
她太棒了，不是吗，舰长？
Marvellous, isn't she, Captain?

243
00:14:56,112 --> 00:14:58,821
是的，呃…难以置信
Yes, uh... incredible.

244
00:14:58,821 --> 00:15:00,523
史波克先生，你有什么感觉？
What is your reaction, Mr. Spock?

245
00:15:00,523 --> 00:15:02,222
我觉得，呃…
I find it, uh...

246
00:15:02,485 --> 00:15:04,976
它有点有趣和怀旧
mildly interesting and somewhat nostalgic,

247
00:15:05,055 --> 00:15:07,153
如果你能理解我的意思
if I understand the use of that word.

248
00:15:07,153 --> 00:15:07,985
怀旧？
Nostalgic?

249
00:15:08,254 --> 00:15:11,030
是的，它有点让人想起
Yes. It is somewhat reminiscent of the dances...

250
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:13,343
瓦肯小孩在幼儿园跳的舞蹈
that Vulcan children do in nursery school.

251
00:15:15,673 --> 00:15:18,529
当然，孩子们不是那么地…
Of course, the children are not so...

252
00:15:18,529 --> 00:15:20,029
协调
well-coordinated.

253
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:27,155
[鼓掌]
[Applause]

254
00:16:28,973 --> 00:16:31,070
如果你想，她是你的了
She's yours if you wish, Captain.

255
00:16:31,254 --> 00:16:34,338
哦，呃…谢谢
Oh, uh... thank you.

256
00:16:34,411 --> 00:16:38,177
那个…你很宽宏大量
That's, um... very magnanimous of you.

257
00:16:43,428 --> 00:16:47,880
你会发现我对朋友慷慨，对敌人无情
You'll find that I am magnanimous to my friends and merciless to my enemies.

258
00:16:48,291 --> 00:16:50,880
我希望你们都成为我的朋友
And I want both of you to be my friends.

259
00:16:51,261 --> 00:16:55,459
我们的友谊究竟建立在什么基础上？
On what, precisely, is our friendship to be based?

260
00:16:55,698 --> 00:17:00,526
嗯，在最坚实的基础上，史波克先生，开明的自我利益
Well, upon the firmest of foundations, Mr. Spock, enlightened self-interest.

261
00:17:01,969 --> 00:17:03,660
舰长，你是银河系仅次于我的
You, Captain, are second only to me...

262
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:05,846
最优秀的军事指挥官
as the finest military commander in the galaxy.

263
00:17:06,409 --> 00:17:07,809
受宠若惊
That's very flattering.

264
00:17:08,411 --> 00:17:13,281
我现在主要是一名探险家，加斯舰长
I am primarily an explorer now, Captain Garth.

265
00:17:13,281 --> 00:17:18,066
我也是，我绘制的新世界地图比历史上任何人都多
And so have I been. I have charted more new worlds than any man in history.

266
00:17:18,066 --> 00:17:22,384
并试图摧毁安托斯四号，为什么？
And tried to destroy Antos IV. Why?

267
00:17:22,727 --> 00:17:26,205
我能说是因为他们对联邦怀有敌意
Well, I could say because they were actively hostile to the Federation.

268
00:17:26,333 --> 00:17:28,509
是的，你能说，但那不是事实
Yes, you could say, but that would be untrue.

269
00:17:29,221 --> 00:17:31,366
同意[轻笑]
Agreed. [Chuckles]

270
00:17:31,517 --> 00:17:33,698
实际上，他们是相当无恶意的
Actually, they were quite harmless,

271
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:36,752
在我受伤将死时，他们让我变得完整
and they made me whole when I was maimed and dying.

272
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:40,039
出于感激之情，我给了他们一个星系
And in my gratitude, I offered them the galaxy.

273
00:17:40,214 --> 00:17:42,991
他们拒绝了我，我判处他们死刑
They rejected me, and I condemned them to death.

274
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:46,180
作为星际舰队的舰长
How could you, a star ship fleet captain,

275
00:17:46,249 --> 00:17:48,183
你怎么会认为联邦船员…
believe that a Federation crew...

276
00:17:48,251 --> 00:17:51,880
会盲目听从你的命令毁灭整个安托斯种族
would blindly obey your order to destroy the entire Antos race,

277
00:17:52,117 --> 00:17:55,356
一个以追求仁爱和平著称的民族？
a people famous for their benevolence and peaceful pursuits?

278
00:17:55,425 --> 00:17:58,394
那是我唯一失算的！
That was my only miscalculation!

279
00:17:58,771 --> 00:18:01,021
我变了
I had changed!

280
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:03,531
我已经克服了这堕落的弱点…
I had risen above this decadent weakness...

281
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,535
顺便说一下，它仍然由你指挥，舰长
which still has you in its command, by the way, captain.

282
00:18:06,603 --> 00:18:10,095
不包括我的船员，我无法左右他们
My crew had not. I couldn't sway them.

283
00:18:10,173 --> 00:18:12,780
但我的新船员，这个房间里的人
But my new crew, the men in this room,

284
00:18:13,099 --> 00:18:15,572
将毫无疑问地服从我的命令
will obey my orders without question.

285
00:18:16,928 --> 00:18:17,942
先生们
Gentlemen,

286
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:20,502
你们有眼睛，但你们看不见
you have eyes but you cannot see.

287
00:18:21,437 --> 00:18:23,805
星系围绕着我们
Galaxies surround us,

288
00:18:24,188 --> 00:18:25,895
无限远景
limitless vistas!

289
00:18:26,469 --> 00:18:29,038
然而，联邦会让我们
And yet the Federation would have us grub away...

290
00:18:29,038 --> 00:18:30,126
像蚂蚁一样
like some ants on some...

291
00:18:30,251 --> 00:18:33,899
在比平常大一点的蚁丘上翻掘
somewhat larger than usual anthill!

292
00:18:34,236 --> 00:18:35,772
但我不是昆虫
But I am not an insect!

293
00:18:36,872 --> 00:18:40,968
我是宇宙的主人，我必须申明我的主权
I am master of the universe, and I must claim my domain.

294
00:18:41,043 --> 00:18:44,499
我同意战争曾经是必要的
I agree there was a time when war was necessary,

295
00:18:44,579 --> 00:18:46,165
而你是我们最伟大的战士
and you were our greatest warrior.

296
00:18:46,387 --> 00:18:48,981
我在校时研究过你在阿克纳的胜利
I studied your victory at Axanar when I was a cadet.

297
00:18:49,057 --> 00:18:51,753
实际上，现在仍是学院的必读内容
In fact, it's still required reading.

298
00:18:51,826 --> 00:18:53,177
也应该是
As well it should be.

299
00:18:53,177 --> 00:18:53,987
很好
Very well.

300
00:18:54,327 --> 00:18:59,090
但我第一次访问阿克纳是作为一名执行和平任务的学员
But my first visit to Axanar was as a new-fledged cadet on a peace mission.

301
00:18:59,513 --> 00:19:02,034
和平任务！政客和弱者！
Peace mission! Politicians and weaklings!

302
00:19:02,103 --> 00:19:04,970
他们是人道主义者和政治家，他们有一个梦想…
They were humanitarians and statesmen, and they had a dream...

303
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:08,435
梦想成为了现实并在星球间传播
a dream that became a reality and spread throughout the stars,

304
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:12,177
这个梦想让史波克先生和我成为了兄弟
a dream that made Mr. Spock and me brothers.

305
00:19:14,325 --> 00:19:19,351
史波克先生，你认为柯克舰长和你自己是兄弟吗？
Mr. Spock, do you consider Captain Kirk and yourself brothers?

306
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:21,785
柯克舰长说话有些形象化
Captain Kirk speaks somewhat figuratively...

307
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:23,780
情绪过度激动
and with undue emotion:

308
00:19:23,945 --> 00:19:27,123
然而，他说的是合乎逻辑的
however, what he says is logical...

309
00:19:27,195 --> 00:19:30,130
我确实同意
and I do, in fact, agree with it.

310
00:19:31,365 --> 00:19:33,299
[笑] 瞎了！
[Laughing] Blind!

311
00:19:33,367 --> 00:19:35,460
真是瞎了眼！
Truly blind!

312
00:19:36,033 --> 00:19:38,630
柯克舰长是你的指挥官！
Captain Kirk is your commanding officer!

313
00:19:38,706 --> 00:19:41,586
而史波克先生，你是他的下属，仅此而已
You are his subordinate and that is all.

314
00:19:42,091 --> 00:19:45,737
然而，史波克先生，你本身就是一位值得称道的指挥官
Yet, Mr. Spock, you are a worthy commander in your own right,

315
00:19:45,737 --> 00:19:50,007
在我的舰队中，你肯定能指挥一艘星舰
and in my fleet you will surely have a star ship to command.

316
00:19:50,084 --> 00:19:54,384
请原谅我，但你的舰队究竟在哪里？
Please forgive me, but exactly where is your fleet?

317
00:19:55,161 --> 00:19:58,260
在那里等我
Out there waiting for me.

318
00:19:59,256 --> 00:20:02,579
他们有充分的理由拥护我的事业
They will flock to my cause, and for good reason.

319
00:20:04,613 --> 00:20:08,105
无限权力，无限财富
Limitless power! Limitless wealth.

320
00:20:08,301 --> 00:20:10,861
由精英统治的太阳系
And solar systems ruled by the elite.

321
00:20:10,994 --> 00:20:14,368
先生们，我们是精英，我们必须拿走我们理应拥有的东西
We, gentlemen, are that elite, and we must take what is rightfully ours...

322
00:20:14,442 --> 00:20:16,437
从现在持有它的颓废弱者手中
from the decadent weaklings that now hold it.

323
00:20:17,893 --> 00:20:19,197
加斯舰长…
Captain Garth...

324
00:20:19,197 --> 00:20:21,259
加斯勋爵！
Lord Garth!

325
00:20:23,208 --> 00:20:24,484
如你所愿
As you wish.

326
00:20:24,552 --> 00:20:26,884
无论如何，你必须意识到这个事实…
At any rate, you must be aware of the fact...

327
00:20:26,954 --> 00:20:30,500
你正试图重现灾难…
that you are attempting to recreate the disaster...

328
00:20:30,739 --> 00:20:33,655
上次这么做让你成为了这个地方的病人
which resulted in your becoming an inmate in this place.

329
00:20:35,155 --> 00:20:37,350
我被背叛了，受到了野蛮的对待
I was betrayed and treated barbarically.

330
00:20:37,424 --> 00:20:40,190
你受到了正义和同情的对待
You were treated with justice and with compassion,

331
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:43,326
而你对待你的受害者则相反
which you failed to show towards any of your intended victims.

332
00:20:43,396 --> 00:20:44,986
从逻辑上讲，因此，人们必须承担…
Logically, therefore, one must assume...

333
00:20:44,986 --> 00:20:47,847
带走这只动物！
Remove this animal!

334
00:20:55,364 --> 00:20:56,906
尝尝这酒，舰长
Try some of this wine, Captain.

335
00:20:57,744 --> 00:21:00,861
它有一种浓郁，醇厚的风味，能让人感觉愉悦
It has a robust, full-bodied flavour which you'll find diverting.

336
00:21:00,973 --> 00:21:03,133
不，谢谢，我宁愿加入史波克先生
No, thank you. I prefer to join Mr. Spock.

337
00:21:03,357 --> 00:21:05,054
我想要你留在这里
And I prefer that you remain here.

338
00:21:06,019 --> 00:21:08,317
玛塔，亲爱的
Marta, my dear.

339
00:21:12,409 --> 00:21:15,867
我们觉得你的表演很迷人，不是吗，舰长？
We found your little divertissement enchanting, didn't we, Captain?

340
00:21:15,946 --> 00:21:19,473
但后面还有，活动才刚刚开始
But there's more to come. The entertainment has merely begun.

341
00:21:20,241 --> 00:21:22,078
顺便说一下，我猜你会下棋
By the way, I assume you play chess.

342
00:21:22,078 --> 00:21:22,882
偶尔
Occasionally.

343
00:21:22,953 --> 00:21:26,548
我也是，你会如何回应女王到女王三级
So do l. How would you respond to queen to queen's level three?

344
00:21:26,623 --> 00:21:30,366
我相信你知道有无限种反击
I'm sure you're aware that there are an infinite number of countermoves.

345
00:21:30,548 --> 00:21:31,925
我只对一个感兴趣
I'm interested in only one.

346
00:21:31,995 --> 00:21:34,896
拼了老命我也想不到是哪一个？
I can't for the life of me imagine which one.

347
00:21:35,078 --> 00:21:37,297
“拼了老命”是个好选择
"For the life of me" is a phrase well chosen.

348
00:21:37,367 --> 00:21:38,598
可能会到那个地步
It could literally come to that.

349
00:21:39,103 --> 00:21:40,928
我死了对你没好处
Dead I am of no use to you.

350
00:21:41,004 --> 00:21:44,963
但我能让你渴望死亡，乞求死亡
But I can make you long for death, beg for death.

351
00:21:45,596 --> 00:21:49,232
“在十一月的午夜，当死人集市临近
"In the midnight of November, when the dead man's fare is nigh,

352
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:52,700
“山谷中充满危险，天空中布满愤怒”
and the danger in the valley, and the anger in the sky."

353
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:56,528
我今天早上写的，你喜欢吗？
I wrote that this morning. Do you like it?

354
00:21:56,927 --> 00:21:58,637
是的，我认为它非常好
Yes, I think it's very good.

355
00:22:02,157 --> 00:22:04,413
[轻声] 告诉他他想知道的
[Softly] Tell him what he wants to know.

356
00:22:04,481 --> 00:22:06,676
我们就一起走
We'll go away together.

357
00:22:06,855 --> 00:22:08,684
[低语] 我不能
[Whispering] I can't.

358
00:22:09,753 --> 00:22:12,278
但你一定要，我求你
But you must. I beg of you.

359
00:22:12,356 --> 00:22:15,367
哦，不要乞求，玛塔！这是有辱人格的
Oh, don't beg, Marta! It's degrading.

360
00:22:17,639 --> 00:22:19,168
女王到女王三级，舰长？
Queen to queen's level three, Captain.

361
00:22:20,794 --> 00:22:23,285
你很快就会
You'll talk freely...

362
00:22:23,534 --> 00:22:24,903
畅所欲言的
and quite soon.

363
00:22:36,585 --> 00:22:38,548
舰长，在你面前的
What you see before you, Captain,

364
00:22:38,902 --> 00:22:40,217
是我的最新发明
is my latest invention.

365
00:22:41,058 --> 00:22:45,307
外表普通，近乎原始，你说是不是？
Quite ordinary in appearance, almost primitive, wouldn't you say?

366
00:22:45,462 --> 00:22:46,499
是的，我认得
Yes, I recognize it.

367
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:49,514
它用于康复目的
It's used for rehabilitation purposes.

368
00:22:49,935 --> 00:22:52,123
它帮助许多人恢复健康
It helped many men back to health.

369
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:54,605
外表有欺骗性
Appearances can be deceiving.

370
00:22:55,585 --> 00:22:58,167
曾经它是康复过程的
Once it was a part of the rehabilitation process,

371
00:22:58,167 --> 00:22:59,920
一部分，其本身是不痛的
and as such, quite painless.

372
00:23:00,523 --> 00:23:02,416
而且，我也可以说是无用的
And I might add useless too.

373
00:23:02,977 --> 00:23:05,712
它让人变得温顺，对我毫无用处
It made men docile and of no use to me.

374
00:23:06,469 --> 00:23:11,828
我对超声波的使用进行了一些改进
I've added certain refinements to the use of ultrasonic waves.

375
00:23:12,092 --> 00:23:14,084
椅子不再是无痛的
The chair is no longer painless.

376
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:16,425
把主管放上去
Put the governor in it.

377
00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:31,138
女王到女王三级，柯克舰长？
Queen to queen's level three, Captain Kirk?

378
00:23:34,586 --> 00:23:38,660
事实上，它极度痛苦
It is, in fact, exquisitely painful,

379
00:23:39,578 --> 00:23:40,752
正如你将看到的
as you will now see.

380
00:23:40,868 --> 00:23:42,761
[尖锐的嗡嗡声]
[High-Pitched Whirring]

381
00:23:44,276 --> 00:23:46,043
[科里呻吟]
[Cory Groaning]

382
00:23:46,043 --> 00:23:47,037
真有趣，不是吗？
Interesting, isn't it?

383
00:23:48,184 --> 00:23:50,744
疼痛是真实的，可以无限地延长
The pain is real and can be prolonged indefinitely,

384
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:53,618
因为没有组织破坏
because there is no actual destruction of tissue.

385
00:23:53,690 --> 00:23:56,124
住手！
Stop it!

386
00:23:57,234 --> 00:23:58,217
[嗡嗡声停止]
[Whirring Stops]

387
00:23:58,294 --> 00:24:01,354
当然，舰长，只要你开口
Of course, Captain. You have but to ask.

388
00:24:03,432 --> 00:24:06,658
现在，如你所见，他没有受到身体伤害
Now, as you can see, he has not been harmed physically,

389
00:24:06,736 --> 00:24:10,584
然而，对极度折磨的记忆仍然存在
yet the memory of the exquisite torment remains.

390
00:24:11,174 --> 00:24:13,066
女王到女王三级，舰长？
Queen to queen's level three, Captain.

391
00:24:14,454 --> 00:24:15,474
不
No.

392
00:24:15,545 --> 00:24:16,372
真遗憾
Too bad.

393
00:24:17,736 --> 00:24:19,742
带走我们尊贵的主管
Remove our distinguished governor.

394
00:24:19,816 --> 00:24:21,662
把柯克舰长放在椅子上
Put Captain Kirk in the chair.

395
00:24:40,468 --> 00:24:42,129
不，你不能那样做！
No, you mustn't do that!

396
00:24:42,361 --> 00:24:44,829
你对我越来越冒犯了，亲爱的
You really are becoming offensive to me, my dear.

397
00:24:44,974 --> 00:24:47,700
不要逼我把你放进去
Don't make it necessary for me to put you in it.

398
00:24:54,751 --> 00:24:57,845
[尖锐的嗡嗡声]
[High-Pitched Whirring]

399
00:25:05,486 --> 00:25:08,318
女王到女王三级，柯克舰长？
Queen to queen's level three, Captain Kirk.

400
00:25:25,704 --> 00:25:26,970
请住手！
Please, stop it!

401
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:29,775
你想要他，不是吗？
You want him, don't you?

402
00:25:31,766 --> 00:25:35,047
是的  非常想加入他吗？
Yes. Badly enough to join him?

403
00:25:37,716 --> 00:25:39,899
听我说，我的加斯勋爵
Listen to me, my Lord Garth.

404
00:25:40,025 --> 00:25:43,770
我可以让他告诉我你想知道的
I can get him to tell me what you want to know.

405
00:25:44,345 --> 00:25:47,974
让你试试可能会很有趣
Might be interesting to have you try.

406
00:25:48,627 --> 00:25:49,533
[嗡嗡声停止]
[Whirring Stops]

407
00:25:49,674 --> 00:25:50,403
[呼气]
[Exhales]

408
00:26:02,393 --> 00:26:04,462
没有突破？  没有， 斯科特先生
No breakthrough? No, Mr. Scott.

409
00:26:04,533 --> 00:26:06,524
仍然没有来自这个星球的回应
Still no response from the planet.

410
00:26:08,072 --> 00:26:09,433
传感器读数？
Sensor readings?

411
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:13,233
星球远端的力场最弱
The force field is weakest on the far side of the planet.

412
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,421
我们可以派一个小队
We can send down a shuttlecraft

413
00:26:15,421 --> 00:26:18,618
穿着环境装置乘穿梭机下去
carrying a team in environmental suits.

414
00:26:19,277 --> 00:26:20,623
没有用的，斯科提
It won't work, Scotty.

415
00:26:20,623 --> 00:26:23,470
他们必须在有毒的大气中跋涉数千英里
They'd have to cover thousands of miles through poisonous atmosphere...

416
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:25,027
在他们到达收容所前
before they'd ever reach the asylum.

417
00:26:25,426 --> 00:26:29,178
是的，你是对的，即使他们成功了，他们无法携带任何强力的东西
Aye, you're right. Even if they made it, they couldn't carry anything powerful enough...

418
00:26:29,178 --> 00:26:30,964
冲破收容所的防护罩
to break through the asylum dome.

419
00:26:31,267 --> 00:26:33,296
只有船本身才能做到
Only the ship herself could do that.

420
00:26:34,086 --> 00:26:35,700
可能会杀了吉姆和史波克
Probably kill Jim and Spock.

421
00:26:36,498 --> 00:26:38,933
医生，他们可能已经死了
Doctor, they may already be dead.

422
00:26:53,298 --> 00:26:54,860
慢慢来，亲爱的
Slowly, darling.

423
00:26:54,928 --> 00:26:55,906
慢慢地
Slowly.

424
00:26:57,743 --> 00:26:59,677
休息
Rest.

425
00:27:02,035 --> 00:27:06,774
这更多的是加斯的游说吗，玛塔？
Is this more of Garth's persuasion, Marta?

426
00:27:08,906 --> 00:27:11,200
我告诉他我会找到你的秘密
I told him I'd discover your secret.

427
00:27:12,216 --> 00:27:13,590
我撒了谎
I lied.

428
00:27:14,179 --> 00:27:17,320
我会告诉他任何事情来拯救你免受那种折磨
I would have told him anything to save you from that torment.

429
00:27:22,411 --> 00:27:24,163
我相信你说的是实话
I believe you mean that.

430
00:27:24,388 --> 00:27:25,556
我是的
I do.

431
00:27:30,631 --> 00:27:32,565
哦
Oh.

432
00:27:32,633 --> 00:27:36,091
这是我一直渴望的地方
This is where I've longed to be.

433
00:27:36,827 --> 00:27:39,707
我想从我第一次见到你的那一刻起，我就知道我爱你
I think I knew I loved you from the moment I first saw you.

434
00:27:41,987 --> 00:27:43,095
玛塔
Marta.

435
00:27:45,179 --> 00:27:46,503
玛塔
Marta,

436
00:27:47,498 --> 00:27:48,831
我可以帮你
I can help you,

437
00:27:49,658 --> 00:27:53,385
但我必须回到企业号才可以
but I must get to the Enterprise to do that.

438
00:27:54,692 --> 00:27:56,221
那是不可能的
That's not possible.

439
00:27:56,221 --> 00:27:57,388
哦，不，可能的
Oh, yes, it is.

440
00:27:58,156 --> 00:28:01,354
如果我能到达控制室…
It is. If I can get to the control room...

441
00:28:01,354 --> 00:28:01,683
并移除力场，那么加斯就完了
and remove the force field, then Garth is finished.

442
00:28:01,683 --> 00:28:06,348
并移除力场，那么加斯就完了
and remove the force field, then Garth is finished.

443
00:28:08,602 --> 00:28:10,048
加斯是我的领袖
Garth is my leader.

444
00:28:10,244 --> 00:28:12,235
他会带你走向毁灭
He will lead you to destruction.

445
00:28:12,235 --> 00:28:13,119
他…
He's...

446
00:28:14,169 --> 00:28:18,105
已经毁掉了本可以帮助你的药物
already destroyed the medicine that could have helped you.

447
00:28:18,645 --> 00:28:21,478
但是船上还有更多的药
But there's more medicine aboard the ship.

448
00:28:22,206 --> 00:28:24,731
我会帮你，但你必须等
I'll help you, but you must wait.

449
00:28:25,285 --> 00:28:27,858
你明白的，不是吗？
You do see that, don't you?

450
00:28:28,082 --> 00:28:29,625
很快，史波克会来这…
Soon Spock will be here and...

451
00:28:29,625 --> 00:28:30,200
史波克？
Spock?

452
00:28:31,139 --> 00:28:33,117
至少我已经安排了
At least I've arranged that much.

453
00:28:33,627 --> 00:28:35,427
你是怎么做到的？
How did you manage that?

454
00:28:36,398 --> 00:28:38,544
告诉一个觉得我性感的守卫
A convincing lie told to a guard...

455
00:28:38,544 --> 00:28:41,411
一个令人信服的谎言
who finds me desirable.

456
00:28:41,545 --> 00:28:42,825
亲爱的…
Darling.

457
00:29:06,605 --> 00:29:08,708
不，不，你不能阻止我！
No, no. Y-You mustn't stop me.

458
00:29:09,258 --> 00:29:11,405
他是我的爱人，我必须杀了他
He's my lover and I have to kill him.

459
00:29:13,504 --> 00:29:14,640
[呻吟]
[Moans]

460
00:29:18,534 --> 00:29:21,007
她似乎想出了一个万无一失的方法
She seems to have worked out an infallible method

461
00:29:21,007 --> 00:29:23,237
以确保男性永久的忠诚
for assuring permanent male fidelity.

462
00:29:23,839 --> 00:29:24,695
有趣
Interesting.

463
00:29:24,905 --> 00:29:25,943
我很高兴见到你
I'm very glad to see you.

464
00:29:26,185 --> 00:29:28,299
谢谢，舰长，我们现在有武器了
Thank you, Captain. We're now armed.

465
00:29:28,411 --> 00:29:30,248
我想我们应该去控制室
I presume we shall try to reach the control room.

466
00:29:30,248 --> 00:29:32,614
是的，你猜得对
Yes, you presume correctly.

467
00:30:02,432 --> 00:30:03,216
[咔嗒声]
[Click]

468
00:30:22,131 --> 00:30:24,065
力场关着，舰长
Force field is now off, Captain.

469
00:30:24,133 --> 00:30:26,624
柯克呼叫企业号，柯克呼叫企业号
Kirk to Enterprise. Kirk to Enterprise.

470
00:30:26,702 --> 00:30:29,330
斯科特先生，我是舰长
Mr. Scott, it's the captain.

471
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:33,768
我是斯科特，舰长，你让我们担心了
Scott here, Captain. You had us worried.

472
00:30:33,842 --> 00:30:37,875
斯科特先生，我想要立刻传送一支武装特遣队下来
Mr. Scott, I want a fully armed security detail beamed down on the double.

473
00:30:38,024 --> 00:30:40,029
他们已经在传送室了，长官
They're already in the transporter room, sir.

474
00:30:40,493 --> 00:30:44,486
并让麦考伊医生尽快准备额外的药物
And have Dr. McCoy prepare additional medicine as quickly as possible.

475
00:30:44,564 --> 00:30:45,260
是的，长官
Aye, aye, sir.

476
00:30:45,582 --> 00:30:48,034
舰长，我建议你回到船上
Captain, I suggest you return to the ship at once.

477
00:30:48,034 --> 00:30:49,887
你的安全对企业号至关重要
Your safety is vital to the Enterprise.

478
00:30:50,570 --> 00:30:52,595
等待你的指令，舰长
Waiting for your order, Captain.

479
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:56,699
我还请求允许留在这负责警卫队
I also request permission to remain here in charge of the security team.

480
00:30:56,776 --> 00:30:58,077
很好，史波克
Very well, Spock.

481
00:30:58,077 --> 00:30:59,006
等待中，舰长
Still waiting, Captain.

482
00:30:59,465 --> 00:31:02,707
斯科特先生，舰长的生命危在旦夕
Mr. Scott, the captain's life is in immediate danger.

483
00:31:02,782 --> 00:31:06,081
把他传送上船，安全小组将委托给我
Beam him aboard at once. The security team will be entrusted to me.

484
00:31:06,547 --> 00:31:08,086
女王到女王三级
Queen to queen's level three.

485
00:31:08,314 --> 00:31:10,847
重复，女王到女王三级
Repeat. Queen to queen's level three.

486
00:31:14,498 --> 00:31:16,462
他在等待正确的答复，舰长
He's waiting for the proper reply, Captain.

487
00:31:17,037 --> 00:31:18,579
[斯科提] 按顺序给出暗号
[Scotty] Give the countersign as ordered.

488
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:26,036
斯科提，史波克先生会给出暗号
Scotty, Mr. Spock will give the countersign.

489
00:31:31,887 --> 00:31:33,438
给他暗号，舰长
Give him the countersign, Captain.

490
00:31:33,668 --> 00:31:36,852
[斯科提] 安全特遣队，准备好传送下去
[Scotty] Security detail, standby to beam down.

491
00:31:42,522 --> 00:31:45,112
开枪，舰长，如果你能的话
Blast away, Captain, if you can.

492
00:31:46,935 --> 00:31:49,936
你以为我会傻到给你充电的相位枪吗？
Do you think I'm fool enough to give you a charged phaser?

493
00:31:59,872 --> 00:32:02,213
你对史波克做了什么？他在哪儿？
What have you done with Spock? Where is he?

494
00:32:02,408 --> 00:32:05,642
我还没有对他做任何事，但我确实对他有计划
I have done nothing with him yet, but I do have plans for him.

495
00:32:06,175 --> 00:32:10,805
瓦肯人会死得很惨，他的死将取决于你的良心
The Vulcan will die horribly, and his death will be on your conscience.

496
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,295
加斯舰长…
Captain Garth-

497
00:32:17,295 --> 00:32:18,557
加斯勋爵！
Lord Garth!

498
00:32:18,628 --> 00:32:19,511
不，长官
No, sir.

499
00:32:20,787 --> 00:32:22,193
加斯舰长
Captain Garth,

500
00:32:22,330 --> 00:32:25,594
星际舰队舰长
star ship fleet captain.

501
00:32:26,186 --> 00:32:27,929
这是一个光荣的称号
That's an honourable title.

502
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,436
我是他们中最伟大的，不是吗？
And I was the greatest of them all, wasn't I?

503
00:32:31,504 --> 00:32:32,791
对，你是
Yes, you were.

504
00:32:34,334 --> 00:32:35,428
是的
Yes.

505
00:32:38,345 --> 00:32:39,789
但你现在是个病人，长官
But you're a sick man now, sir.

506
00:32:39,789 --> 00:32:41,261
我从未如此健康
I have never been more healthy.

507
00:32:41,261 --> 00:32:42,986
不，不，想想
No. No, think.

508
00:32:42,986 --> 00:32:43,253
不，不，想想
sdfad

509
00:32:43,416 --> 00:32:45,941
回想一下你是谁
Think back to what you were...

510
00:32:46,296 --> 00:32:49,213
在导致你去安托斯四号的事故前
before the accident that sent you to Antos IV.

511
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,691
试试
Try.

512
00:32:53,728 --> 00:32:59,193
我不记得了，就好像我死了又重生了一样
I can't remember. It's almost as if I had died and was reborn.

513
00:32:59,265 --> 00:33:02,723
不，我…我记得
No, I-I can remember.

514
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:04,386
你…
You...

515
00:33:05,517 --> 00:33:08,495
是学院最优秀的学生
were the finest student at the academy,

516
00:33:08,986 --> 00:33:11,766
最优秀的星舰舰长
the finest star ship captain.

517
00:33:11,844 --> 00:33:15,184
你是模范，我们其他人的榜样
You were the prototype, the model for the rest of us.

518
00:33:16,671 --> 00:33:18,760
是的，我确实记得
Yes, I do remember that.

519
00:33:20,019 --> 00:33:22,044
那是一项重大的责任
It was a great responsibility,

520
00:33:22,266 --> 00:33:23,731
但我很自豪能够承担
but one I was proud to bear.

521
00:33:24,622 --> 00:33:26,291
你表现得很好
And you bore it well.

522
00:33:28,450 --> 00:33:32,980
疾病改变了你
And the disease that changed you,

523
00:33:33,569 --> 00:33:34,666
那不是你的错
it's not your fault.

524
00:33:34,957 --> 00:33:38,835
从那以后你所做的可怕的事情，并不是你的责任
And the terrible things you did since then, not truly responsible.

525
00:33:39,539 --> 00:33:42,064
我不想再听了，你很软弱
I don't want to hear any more. You're weak,

526
00:33:42,141 --> 00:33:44,072
你试图耗尽我的力量
and trying to drain my strength.

527
00:33:44,072 --> 00:33:45,076
不，我没有
No, I'm not.

528
00:33:45,405 --> 00:33:47,305
我想要你找到你曾经拥有的
I want you to find what you once had,

529
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:50,247
我想要你回溯你失去的伟大，加斯舰长
I want you to go back to the greatness that you've lost, Captain Garth.

530
00:33:50,316 --> 00:33:53,080
我是加斯勋爵！
I am Lord Garth!

531
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:55,848
宇宙之主
Master of the universe!

532
00:33:55,922 --> 00:33:59,624
你怀疑我，因为我还没有加冕
You doubt me because I have not yet had my coronation.

533
00:33:59,624 --> 00:34:00,971
不，长官，听我说，我
No, sir, listen to me. I-

534
00:34:00,971 --> 00:34:01,798
停！
Stop!

535
00:34:03,299 --> 00:34:04,392
跪下
On your knees.

536
00:34:04,392 --> 00:34:04,792
不
No.

537
00:34:05,051 --> 00:34:07,183
给我跪下！
On your knees before me!

538
00:34:07,814 --> 00:34:10,528
在我之前的所有其他人都失败了
All the others before me have failed--

539
00:34:10,603 --> 00:34:12,764
亚历山大、凯撒、拿破仑、
Alexander, Caesar, Napoleon,

540
00:34:13,003 --> 00:34:16,270
希特勒、李光、克罗图斯！
Hitler, Lee Kuan, Krotus!

541
00:34:17,252 --> 00:34:18,822
他们都化作了尘土！
All of them are dust!

542
00:34:20,546 --> 00:34:21,838
但我会胜利的
But I will triumph!

543
00:34:22,861 --> 00:34:27,409
我会做出最终的征服！
I will make the ultimate conquest!

544
00:34:48,875 --> 00:34:50,415
宝座必须更高
The throne must be higher.

545
00:34:50,483 --> 00:34:53,418
它一定要比这个房间里的任何东西都高
It must be higher than anything else in this room.

546
00:34:53,486 --> 00:34:56,080
唔，把那张桌子当底座
Mmm, use that table as a pedestal.

547
00:34:56,155 --> 00:34:58,517
啊，欢迎回来，柯克舰长
Ah, welcome back, Captain Kirk.

548
00:34:58,517 --> 00:35:00,181
我很高兴你能参加加冕典礼
I'm glad you could make it for the coronation.

549
00:35:01,692 --> 00:35:02,822
加冕？
Coronation?

550
00:35:02,896 --> 00:35:07,856
是的，哦，我知道，即使是真正的宝座也只不过是一把椅子
Yes. Oh, I know that even a real throne is no more than merely a chair,

551
00:35:07,934 --> 00:35:10,596
但象征意义很重要，你不同意吗？
but the symbolism is important, don't you agree?

552
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:14,333
是的我同意，我想你也会戴上皇冠的
Yes, I agree. You'll wear a crown too, I presume?

553
00:35:14,407 --> 00:35:16,773
但同样，只是一个象征
But again, just as a token.

554
00:35:16,843 --> 00:35:20,472
但它可以作为旗帜，召集我们的追随者
It will serve as a standard around which our followers will rally.

555
00:35:20,547 --> 00:35:23,812
加斯，你只有几个手下
Garth, you have only a handful of men.

556
00:35:23,883 --> 00:35:28,445
你真的拒绝参与这件事，不是吗，舰长？
You do refuse to enter into the spirit of the thing, don't you, Captain?

557
00:35:28,521 --> 00:35:31,251
也许你想在仪式中扮演更重要的角色
Perhaps you'd like a larger role in the ceremony.

558
00:35:31,324 --> 00:35:33,952
你可以充当人类祭品
You could serve as human sacrifice.

559
00:35:34,269 --> 00:35:35,961
不，我一点也不会享受
No, I wouldn't enjoy that at all.

560
00:35:36,232 --> 00:35:38,259
再说，你好像需要我活着
Besides, you seem to need me alive.

561
00:35:38,331 --> 00:35:41,698
不错，那么，呃…
How true. All right, uh...

562
00:35:42,402 --> 00:35:43,998
储君怎么样？
how about crown prince?

563
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:46,129
那会让你成为我们的继承人
That would make you our heir apparent.

564
00:35:46,205 --> 00:35:49,140
继承人，我相信这是适合你的角色
Heir apparent, I believe, is the proper role for you.

565
00:35:49,208 --> 00:35:53,144
此外，我们还有其他的人类祭品候选人
Besides, we have other candidates for our human sacrifice.

566
00:35:53,212 --> 00:35:55,942
谁知道呢？我们准备好了
Who knows? Ready.

567
00:36:21,975 --> 00:36:26,275
嗯，既然没有足够强大的人来主持这个仪式
Well, since there is no one mighty enough to perform this ceremony,

568
00:36:26,346 --> 00:36:28,371
我就自己主持
we'll perform it ourselves.

569
00:36:28,448 --> 00:36:32,382
因此，我在此宣布我是
Therefore, we hereby proclaim that I am...

570
00:36:32,382 --> 00:36:35,818
加斯勋爵，宇宙的主人
Lord Garth, master of the universe.

571
00:36:37,523 --> 00:36:40,600
我指定我心爱的玛塔
And we designate our beloved Marta...

572
00:36:41,539 --> 00:36:43,094
为我的配偶
to be our consort.

573
00:36:48,088 --> 00:36:53,221
我进一步指定企业号的柯克舰长
And we further designate Captain James Kirk of the star ship Enterprise...

574
00:36:53,557 --> 00:36:55,097
为我的继承人
to be our heir apparent.

575
00:37:20,763 --> 00:37:23,125
现在把我的继承人带走
Let's now remove our heir apparent,

576
00:37:23,202 --> 00:37:25,534
我就可以结束这场仪式了
that we may conclude this ceremony.

577
00:37:44,967 --> 00:37:46,532
[开门]
[Door Opens]

578
00:37:46,609 --> 00:37:49,623
听我说，这可能是我们最后的机会了…
Listen to me. This may be our last chance...

579
00:37:52,615 --> 00:37:55,639
加斯会毁了我们所有人，除非你们帮我阻止他
Garth will destroy all of us unless you help me stop him.

580
00:37:55,639 --> 00:37:59,666
他在利用你们，知道吗，因为他想要自己拥有权力
And he's using you, you know, because he wants the power for himself.

581
00:38:00,231 --> 00:38:03,212
我带来了一些本可能治愈你们的东西，但被他摧毁了
I brought something that might have cured you, but he destroyed it.

582
00:38:03,212 --> 00:38:07,071
如果我让一支巡逻队下来，他们会带更多的...哦！
If I can get a patrol down, they'd bring more-Oh!

583
00:38:13,337 --> 00:38:14,402
做得好
Well done.

584
00:38:16,865 --> 00:38:20,028
好吧，舰长，你继续反抗
Well, Captain, you continue to resist.

585
00:38:20,102 --> 00:38:22,195
你真蠢
How stupid of you.

586
00:38:22,270 --> 00:38:23,882
把他放在这把椅子上
Put him in that chair right here.

587
00:38:24,667 --> 00:38:26,462
我安排了一个小节目
I've arranged a small entertainment.

588
00:38:26,715 --> 00:38:29,650
我不想让他错过任何细节
I wouldn't want him to miss any of it.

589
00:38:36,054 --> 00:38:39,416
舰长，连你都得承认我是个天才
Well, Captain, even you must admit that I'm a genius.

590
00:38:39,488 --> 00:38:41,351
你看到的是我的最新发明
What you see here is my latest invention.

591
00:38:42,099 --> 00:38:43,823
这是一个炸药
This is an explosive,

592
00:38:44,726 --> 00:38:46,362
史上最强的
the most powerful one in history.

593
00:38:47,629 --> 00:38:49,265
如果我丢下这个烧瓶
If I were to drop this flask,

594
00:38:49,265 --> 00:38:53,133
由此产生的爆炸会使这个星球蒸发
the resulting explosion would vaporize this planet.

595
00:38:54,874 --> 00:38:57,707
现在，你明白为什么抵抗我是荒谬的了吗，舰长？
Now do you see why it is ridiculous to resist me, Captain?

596
00:38:59,754 --> 00:39:01,940
好吧，也许你需要
Well, perhaps you require...

597
00:39:02,010 --> 00:39:04,442
我安排的演示
the demonstration I've arranged.

598
00:39:07,691 --> 00:39:09,352
盯紧了
Watch closely.

599
00:39:09,426 --> 00:39:13,556
的确，她像毒蛇一样致命
Now, it is true that she is deadly as a poisonous serpent:

600
00:39:13,630 --> 00:39:16,531
但她也是一个美丽的女人
but she is also a beautiful woman,

601
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:19,626
你曾经抱她在你的怀里，舰长
and you have held her in your arms, Captain.

602
00:39:22,626 --> 00:39:26,301
我命令我的人把她赶出防护罩
I've ordered my men to drive her out of the protective dome.

603
00:39:26,376 --> 00:39:31,143
当然，几分钟后她会在外面窒息而死
And, of course, she would choke to death on the outside in minutes,

604
00:39:31,214 --> 00:39:33,719
但我为她安排了一个更仁慈的结局
but I've arranged a more merciful end for her...

605
00:39:35,107 --> 00:39:38,347
因为，毕竟，舰长，她是我的配偶
because after all, Captain, she is my consort.

606
00:39:40,157 --> 00:39:43,423
她的项链中植入了一颗微小的晶体
One tiny crystal implanted in her necklace,

607
00:39:43,894 --> 00:39:48,177
一份这种炸药比一粒沙子还小
a portion of this explosive no bigger than a grain of sand.

608
00:39:48,724 --> 00:39:50,996
我打算从这里引爆它
I propose to detonate it from here.

609
00:40:03,687 --> 00:40:05,356
可怜的姑娘
Oh, poor girl.

610
00:40:06,548 --> 00:40:08,675
可怜的受苦受难的孩子
Poor, dear, suffering child.

611
00:40:11,933 --> 00:40:14,401
我现在就帮她
I will help her now.

612
00:40:30,570 --> 00:40:32,393
厄尔巴二号上发生了爆炸
There's been an explosion on Elba Il!

613
00:40:33,710 --> 00:40:35,240
.95
Point nine five!

614
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:36,645
它一定已经抹除了一切
It must've wiped out everything!

615
00:40:36,713 --> 00:40:40,168
立即探测！力场还在吗，苏鲁先生？
Immediate probe! Is the force field in place, Mr. Sulu?

616
00:40:40,232 --> 00:40:41,550
是的，长官，很坚固
Yes, sir. Solidly.

617
00:40:42,364 --> 00:40:44,134
生命继续存在于这个星球上
Life continues to exist on the planet.

618
00:40:44,387 --> 00:40:46,178
必须以某种方式突围
Got to break through it somehow!

619
00:40:46,178 --> 00:40:46,809
医生
Doctor,

620
00:40:46,809 --> 00:40:51,678
我告诉过你，我们做不到，除非杀死庇护所穹顶中的所有人
I told you we couldn't do it without killing everyone in the asylum dome.

621
00:40:51,995 --> 00:40:53,316
我知道，斯科提
I know it, Scotty.

622
00:40:53,821 --> 00:40:57,257
好吧，最后有件事我们可以试一下
Well, there's one last thing we might try.

623
00:40:57,500 --> 00:41:01,730
也许飞船的相位炮可以在最薄弱的地方切开力场
Perhaps the ship's phasers can cut through a section of the forcefield at its weakest point.

624
00:41:02,193 --> 00:41:04,324
你之前说它在哪里？
Where did you say that was located?

625
00:41:04,324 --> 00:41:06,027
在星球的另一侧
On the far side of the planet.

626
00:41:06,243 --> 00:41:08,391
它会为下面的人留下安全距离吗？
Will it leave a margin of safety for the people below?

627
00:41:08,447 --> 00:41:09,204
是的，长官
Yes, sir.

628
00:41:09,204 --> 00:41:11,210
准备改变轨道，苏鲁先生
Prepare to change orbital path, Mr. Sulu.

629
00:41:12,696 --> 00:41:14,316
解除轨道坐标
Orbital coordinates released, sir.

630
00:41:14,617 --> 00:41:18,334
终止同步轨道,前往航线14，标记68
Break synchronous orbit. Come to course 14 mark 68.

631
00:41:21,858 --> 00:41:24,798
航线14，标记68
Course 14 mark 68.

632
00:41:25,570 --> 00:41:27,014
重新建立同步轨道，长官
Synchronous orbit re-established, sir.

633
00:41:27,351 --> 00:41:28,893
飞船相位炮调到窄波束
Ship's phasers to narrow beam.

634
00:41:30,296 --> 00:41:31,642
飞船相位炮准备好了，长官
Ship's phasers ready, sir.

635
00:41:31,642 --> 00:41:33,423
让我们在上面打个洞，全功率
Let's punch a hole in it. Full power.

636
00:41:38,208 --> 00:41:40,267
再来一次，全功率
Another blast, full power.

637
00:41:44,614 --> 00:41:45,988
力场还在，长官
Force field's still holding, sir.

638
00:41:50,453 --> 00:41:51,387
接着
Here.

639
00:41:52,986 --> 00:41:55,420
[加斯笑]
[Garth Laughing]

640
00:41:58,315 --> 00:41:59,953
柯克，你觉得经怎么样？
How are your nerves, Kirk?

641
00:42:01,316 --> 00:42:04,711
我只能说，加斯，如果它发生在我身上，它也会发生在你身上
All I can say, Garth, if it happens to me, it happens to you.

642
00:42:05,835 --> 00:42:08,099
你真是一个特别的家伙，柯克
You're an extraordinary fellow, Kirk.

643
00:42:08,706 --> 00:42:11,104
你的固执违背了所有的逻辑
Your stubbornness defies all logic.

644
00:42:12,366 --> 00:42:15,239
逻辑，这就是关键
Logic, that is the key.

645
00:42:16,573 --> 00:42:19,490
你的朋友史波克是个有逻辑的人
Your friend Spock is a logical man.

646
00:42:20,948 --> 00:42:22,589
一个很有逻辑的人
A very logical man.

647
00:42:24,454 --> 00:42:27,480
去把瓦肯人带到我这里来
Go and bring the Vulcan here to me.

648
00:42:45,153 --> 00:42:46,667
[电流噼啪声]
[Electrical Crackling]

649
00:42:54,787 --> 00:42:56,175
[咔嗒声]
[Click]

650
00:43:01,939 --> 00:43:02,920
[咔嗒声]
[Click]

651
00:43:32,861 --> 00:43:36,460
史波克不仅比你更有逻辑，舰长
Spock is not only a more logical man than you, Captain,

652
00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:38,582
而且是一个更聪明的人，我肯定
he's a more intelligent one, I'm sure.

653
00:43:40,034 --> 00:43:42,509
我将与他建立融洽的关系
I shall establish a rapport with him.

654
00:43:42,663 --> 00:43:44,597
[哔哔声]
[Beeping]

655
00:43:45,678 --> 00:43:47,612
[咔嗒声]
[Click]

656
00:43:54,372 --> 00:43:55,635
真有趣
Fascinating.

657
00:43:57,654 --> 00:44:02,751
你的瓦肯朋友是一个非常机敏的家伙，这可能是最有趣的
Your Vulcan friend is a very ingenious fellow. This could be most amusing.

658
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:12,631
那是加斯，击晕他
That's Garth. Stun him.

659
00:44:12,631 --> 00:44:14,508
别开枪，史波克，那是加斯
Hold it, Spock! That's Garth!

660
00:44:23,761 --> 00:44:27,527
仔细看看我，史波克，你看不出来我是你的舰长吗？
Look at me carefully, Spock. Can't you tell I'm your captain?

661
00:44:27,598 --> 00:44:29,431
女王到女王三级
Queen to queen's level three.

662
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:32,783
我不会回答，这就是他想知道的
I won't answer that. That's exactly what he wants to know.

663
00:44:32,783 --> 00:44:36,863
非常聪明，加斯，这正是我要说的
Very clever, Garth. That's exactly what I was going to say.

664
00:44:38,490 --> 00:44:39,822
你在干什么？
What are you doing?

665
00:44:39,935 --> 00:44:43,861
安排传送一支安全小队下来，有异议吗？
Arranging to beam down a security team. Are there any objections?

666
00:44:44,015 --> 00:44:46,142
是的，他们可能会陷入陷阱
Yes. They may walk into a trap.

667
00:44:48,265 --> 00:44:50,290
没错，加斯能摧毁我们
That's right. Garth can destroy us.

668
00:44:52,289 --> 00:44:53,565
真有趣
Fascinating.

669
00:44:56,229 --> 00:44:57,506
我们用什么策略
What maneuver did we use...

670
00:44:57,576 --> 00:44:59,942
在天仓五附近打败了罗慕伦飞船？
to defeat the Romulan vessel near Tau Ceti?

671
00:45:00,175 --> 00:45:02,964
非常好，史波克，科克伦减速
Very good, Spock. The Cochran deceleration.

672
00:45:03,761 --> 00:45:06,370
史波克，你知道……
Spock, you know...

673
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:08,967
科克伦减速是经典的战斗策略
the Cochran deceleration's a classic battle maneuver.

674
00:45:08,967 --> 00:45:10,707
每个星舰舰长都知道这一点
Every star ship captain knows that.

675
00:45:12,117 --> 00:45:14,142
同意，舰长
Agreed, Captain.

676
00:45:15,973 --> 00:45:18,177
舰长们
Captains.

677
00:45:18,249 --> 00:45:23,949
先生们，无论你们中的哪一个是加斯舰长
Gentlemen, whichever one of you is Captain Garth...

678
00:45:24,021 --> 00:45:28,549
都必须花费大量精力来维持柯克舰长的形象
must be expending a great deal of energy to maintain the image of Captain Kirk.

679
00:45:28,626 --> 00:45:32,494
这种能量水平不能无限期地保持
That energy level cannot be maintained indefinitely,

680
00:45:32,563 --> 00:45:35,123
而我有时间
and I have time.

681
00:46:26,684 --> 00:46:30,381
我是你的舰长，史波克！你看不出来吗？开枪，开枪！
I'm your captain, Spock! Can't you tell? Shoot. Shoot!

682
00:46:32,390 --> 00:46:35,215
他是对的，史波克，你必须开枪，但你必须朝我们俩开枪
He's right, Spock, you must shoot. But you must shoot both of us.

683
00:46:35,591 --> 00:46:37,940
这是确保企业号安全的唯一途径
It's the only way to ensure the safety of the Enterprise.

684
00:46:51,210 --> 00:46:52,940
我猜你是柯克舰长
Captain Kirk, I presume.

685
00:46:54,276 --> 00:46:55,308
史波克先生
Mr. Spock.

686
00:47:00,427 --> 00:47:02,579
史波克呼叫企业号
Spock to Enterprise.

687
00:47:02,579 --> 00:47:03,811
[斯科提] 这里是企业号
[Scotty] Enterprise here.

688
00:47:03,888 --> 00:47:05,822
女王到女王三级
Queen to queen's level three.

689
00:47:05,890 --> 00:47:08,256
女王到国王一级
Queen to king's level one.

690
00:47:10,666 --> 00:47:13,627
肌内注射可以吗？
Will intramuscular injection be satisfactory?

691
00:47:13,966 --> 00:47:17,634
除非条件不允许，否则需要静脉注射
Intravenous is indicated unless circumstances make it impossible.

692
00:47:17,911 --> 00:47:20,762
麦考伊医生，多久生效？
How long before it takes effect, Dr. McCoy?

693
00:47:21,049 --> 00:47:25,673
动脉和脑损伤的逆转应立即开始
Reversal of arterial and brain damage should begin almost immediately.

694
00:47:25,743 --> 00:47:28,712
[低沉的嗡嗡声]
[Low-Pitched Whirring]

695
00:47:34,874 --> 00:47:35,771
[咔嗒声]
[Click]

696
00:47:35,771 --> 00:47:37,349
[嗡嗡声停止]
[Whirring Stops]

697
00:47:41,058 --> 00:47:43,959
加斯舰长，我是詹姆斯·柯克
Captain Garth, I'm James Kirk.

698
00:47:46,190 --> 00:47:47,804
我是史波克先生
I am Mr. Spock,

699
00:47:48,055 --> 00:47:50,300
星舰上的科学官
science officer on a star ship.

700
00:47:52,412 --> 00:47:53,836
星舰企业号
The star ship Enterprise.

701
00:47:54,528 --> 00:47:57,032
星舰？
Star ship?

702
00:47:57,720 --> 00:47:59,042
星舰？
Star ship?

703
00:47:59,110 --> 00:48:03,046
是的，长官，企业号，我是舰长
Yes, sir, the Enterprise. I'm the captain.

704
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:14,612
我能帮你吗？
Can I help you?

705
00:48:14,827 --> 00:48:18,347
不，舰长，药似乎起效了
No, Captain. The medicine seems to be taking effect.

706
00:48:18,647 --> 00:48:21,247
我应付得了，这是非常令人鼓舞的
I can manage. It's very encouraging.

707
00:48:31,142 --> 00:48:32,705
先生，我应该认识你吗？
Should I know you, sir?

708
00:48:32,705 --> 00:48:36,597
不，舰长，不
No, Captain. No.

709
00:48:43,487 --> 00:48:45,853
史波克先生  是的，舰长
Mr. Spock. Yes, Captain.

710
00:48:45,923 --> 00:48:50,451
告诉我，为什么无法分辨我们之间的区别？
Tell me, why was it so impossible to tell the difference between us?

711
00:48:50,528 --> 00:48:52,462
并非不可能，舰长
It was not impossible, Captain.

712
00:48:52,530 --> 00:48:54,547
我们在这里的存在证明了这一点
Our presence here is proof of that.

713
00:48:54,852 --> 00:48:57,362
是的，恭喜
Yes, and congratulations.

714
00:48:58,689 --> 00:49:00,134
你怎么花了这么久？
What took you so long?

715
00:49:00,204 --> 00:49:04,106
不确定的间隔实际上相当短，舰长
The interval of uncertainty was actually fairly brief, Captain.

716
00:49:04,175 --> 00:49:06,871
只是对你来说似乎很长
It only seemed long to you.

717
00:49:06,944 --> 00:49:09,879
我在等待打斗的胜利者
I was waiting for a victor in the struggle,

718
00:49:09,947 --> 00:49:12,108
我假定会是加斯舰长
which I assumed would be Captain Garth.

719
00:49:13,384 --> 00:49:16,148
因为你的状况不佳
Because of your depleted condition.

720
00:49:17,213 --> 00:49:19,246
未能解决打斗
Failing a resolution to the struggle,

721
00:49:19,323 --> 00:49:23,274
我被迫使用其他方式来做出决定
I was forced to use other means to make my determination.

722
00:49:23,961 --> 00:49:25,013
我知道了
I see.

723
00:49:26,914 --> 00:49:28,564
史波克先生，唔
Mr. Spock, um,

724
00:49:29,353 --> 00:49:31,146
让自己被击中头部
letting yourself be hit on the head,

725
00:49:31,146 --> 00:49:34,589
我猜你让自己被击中了头部
and I presume you let yourself be hit on the head,

726
00:49:35,163 --> 00:49:39,108
这完全不像聪明人会想出来的方法
is not exactly a method King Solomon would have approved.

727
00:49:39,377 --> 00:49:42,073
斯科特先生，准备好传送上船
Mr. Scott, ready to beam up.

728
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:44,414
是的，长官
Aye, aye, sir.
