[柯克]舰长日志：星历5818.4
[KIRK] Captain's Log : Star date 5818.4.

2
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:10,641
企业号当前工作的银河系象限中
A botanical plague is devastating a planet

3
00:00:10,641 --> 00:00:13,817
一个星球正被一场瘟疫毁灭
in the quadrant of the galaxy where the Enterprise is operating at present.

4
00:00:14,879 --> 00:00:17,960
它危及整个星球上的植被
It threatens to destroy the vegetation on the entire planet,

5
00:00:18,331 --> 00:00:20,113
让它无法居住
leaving it uninhabitable.

6
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:25,263
根据联邦命令，我们正以最高曲速驶向阿尔达纳星球
At Federation orders, we're proceeding at top warp speed to the planet Ardana,

7
00:00:25,366 --> 00:00:27,494
那里存在唯一已知的天顶石来源
where the only known source of zenite exists.

8
00:00:27,943 --> 00:00:29,814
它是可以阻止瘟疫的一种物质
It is the one substance that can halt the plague.

9
00:00:31,135 --> 00:00:35,563
舰长，阿尔达纳的高级顾问已准备好在斯特拉托斯接待您，长官
Captain, the high adviser of Ardana is ready to receive you on Stratos, sir.

10
00:00:36,503 --> 00:00:39,143
在斯特拉托斯？那是他们的云城，对吗，史波克先生？
On Stratos? That's their cloud city, isn't it, Mr. Spock?

11
00:00:39,688 --> 00:00:40,320
是的，舰长
It is, Captain.

12
00:00:41,017 --> 00:00:41,919
一定有什么误会
There must be some mistake.

13
00:00:42,111 --> 00:00:44,918
你有矿井入口的坐标吗？
Do you have the coordinates to the mine entrance available?

14
00:00:45,446 --> 00:00:47,818
已提供给传送人员
They've been provided to the transport officer,

15
00:00:48,319 --> 00:00:50,943
以及高级顾问会议厅的坐标
along with those of the council chamber of the high adviser.

16
00:00:52,486 --> 00:00:53,464
柯克呼叫传送室
Kirk to transporter room.

17
00:00:53,623 --> 00:00:54,904
[斯科特]准备传送
[SCOTT] Ready to transport.

18
00:00:55,368 --> 00:00:59,180
斯科特先生，你锁定的是矿井入口还是他们的云城斯特拉托斯？
Mr. Scott, are you locked in on the mine entrance or on their cloud city, Stratos?

19
00:00:59,605 --> 00:01:01,556
矿井入口，是你要求的，舰长
The mine entrance. That's what you ordered, Captain.

20
00:01:02,211 --> 00:01:07,435
好的，乌乎拉，告诉高级顾问
Right. Uhura, tell the high adviser that

21
00:01:07,898 --> 00:01:11,458
由于紧急情况，我们要求取消欢迎仪式
we request to dispense with the welcoming ceremonies due to the emergency,

22
00:01:11,552 --> 00:01:13,526
我们将直接传送到矿井入口
that we're beaming directly down to the mine entrance

23
00:01:13,792 --> 00:01:17,366
以确保尽快交付天顶石，需求十分迫切
in order to ensure the fastest possible delivery of the zenite : the need is urgent.

24
00:01:17,604 --> 00:01:18,204
是的，长官
Aye, sir.

25
00:01:18,266 --> 00:01:19,110
史波克先生，跟我来
Mr. Spock, come with me.

26
00:01:21,028 --> 00:01:23,301
告诉他们我们感到很荣幸
Oh, and tell them that we appreciate the honor

27
00:01:23,311 --> 00:01:25,472
我们期待将来的访问
and that we look forward to some visit in the future.

28
00:01:25,781 --> 00:01:26,197
是的，长官
Aye, sir.

29
00:01:49,556 --> 00:01:53,460
斯特拉托斯，舰长，一座真正漂浮在空中的城市
Stratos, Captain, a city actually floating in the sky.

30
00:01:53,935 --> 00:01:55,586
[柯克]看起来和它的名声一样平静
[Kirk] Looks as tranquil as its reputation.

31
00:01:55,913 --> 00:01:58,729
它是银河系中最有趣的大都市之一
It is one of the most interesting metropolises in the galaxy.

32
00:01:59,421 --> 00:02:00,637
你来过这儿吗，舰长？
Have you ever visited here, Captain?

33
00:02:01,176 --> 00:02:03,127
来过一次，但没能有时间游览
Once. I didn't have time to look around.

34
00:02:03,552 --> 00:02:07,398
我没有机会，然而，我听说它的艺术形式是无与伦比的
I've never had the opportunity. However, I hear its art forms are incomparable.

35
00:02:07,499 --> 00:02:09,931
是的，艺术是人们的主要职业
Yes, art is the population's chief occupation.

36
00:02:10,011 --> 00:02:12,862
这是一个完全知识分子的社会
It is a totally intellectual society.

37
00:02:13,351 --> 00:02:15,399
所有形式的暴力都已被消除
All forms of violence have been eliminated.

38
00:02:16,176 --> 00:02:17,102
那里是矿井入口
There's the mine entrance.

39
00:02:17,537 --> 00:02:18,955
天顶石应该在那里
The zenite consignment should have been there.

40
00:02:31,963 --> 00:02:32,758
I don't understand it.
我不明白

41
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:37,183
当我们传送下来时，特罗格莱特矿工们应该已经交货了
Those Troglyte miners were supposed to have made delivery when we beamed down.

42
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:39,204
也许有别的入口，舰长
Perhaps there is another entrance, Captain.

43
00:02:49,055 --> 00:02:52,127
看来特罗格莱特已经改变了他们对交付的看法
It would seem the Troglytes have changed their minds about delivery.

44
00:03:09,402 --> 00:03:11,770
[柯克]宇宙，最后的边疆
[KIRK] Space, the final frontier.

45
00:03:18,429 --> 00:03:21,582
这些是星舰企业号的航程
These are the voyages of the starship Enterprise.

46
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:26,354
它的五年任务：探索未知的新世界
Its five-year mission, to explore strange new worlds,

47
00:03:26,882 --> 00:03:29,660
寻找新生命和新文明
to seek out new life and new civilizations,

48
00:03:30,876 --> 00:03:33,564
勇踏前人未至之境
to boldly go where no man has gone before.

49
00:03:34,441 --> 00:03:37,663
星际旅行：原初
第三季第二十一集

50
00:04:06,907 --> 00:04:08,975
云端看守者
The Cloud Minders

51
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:18,344
你们是谁？为什么要攻击？
Who are you? What's the meaning of this attack?

52
00:04:18,723 --> 00:04:21,698
干预导致的攻击，舰长，来吧
Interference breeds attack, Captain. Come on!

53
00:04:22,151 --> 00:04:24,794
经你们政府议会的许可，我们来这里执行紧急任务
We're here by permission of your government council on an emergency mission.

54
00:04:25,077 --> 00:04:27,175
继续前进，舰长
Move on, Captain.

55
00:05:18,146 --> 00:05:19,100
特罗格莱特，停下！
Troglytes, halt!

56
00:05:23,605 --> 00:05:24,949
投降，否则我们会开火！
Surrender or we'll fire!

57
00:05:40,533 --> 00:05:41,459
你们受伤了吗，先生们？
Are you harmed, gentlemen?

58
00:05:42,273 --> 00:05:43,311
不，只是受到了一点惊吓
No, just a little shaken up.

59
00:05:43,648 --> 00:05:46,016
我是普拉苏斯，星球议会的高级顾问
I'm Plasus, high advisor of the planet council.

60
00:05:46,473 --> 00:05:48,545
我是企业号的柯克舰长，这是我的大副史波克先生
Captain Kirk, Enterprise. Mr. Spock.

61
00:05:49,046 --> 00:05:50,288
您好，顾问先生
Greetings, Mr. Advisor.

62
00:05:50,669 --> 00:05:53,124
我对你在阿尔达纳受到的不愉快的欢迎深表歉意
My regrets for the unpleasantness of your welcome to Ardana.

63
00:05:53,517 --> 00:05:54,196
它相当热血
It was rather warm.

64
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:57,724
很不幸，特罗格莱特关于使用暴力
Unfortunately, violence is habitual with the Troglytes.

65
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:01,511
但我向你保证，这种侮辱不会逍遥法外
But I assure you, this insult will not go unpunished.

66
00:06:01,815 --> 00:06:04,271
我更关心天顶石交付
I'm more concerned with the zenite consignment.

67
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:05,955
为什么不在指定位置？
Why wasn't it in its specified location?

68
00:06:06,231 --> 00:06:09,402
显然，破坏者没收了它，我就知道他们会这么做
Apparently, the Disrupters have confiscated it, just as I knew they would.

69
00:06:09,865 --> 00:06:12,361
破坏者？他们是谁？
The Disruptors? Who are they?

70
00:06:12,611 --> 00:06:14,854
一小群特罗格莱特不满者
A small group of Troglyte malcontents.

71
00:06:15,301 --> 00:06:17,648
所有其他特罗格莱特都受他们控制
All the other Troglytes are completely dominated by them.

72
00:06:18,224 --> 00:06:21,854
破坏者要为拒绝继续开采天顶石负责
It's the Disrupters who are responsible for their refusal to continue mining for zenite.

73
00:06:22,013 --> 00:06:24,447
他们同意交付，你的议会向我们保证过
They agreed to the delivery. Your council assured us of it.

74
00:06:24,712 --> 00:06:28,337
他们的同意显然是个诡计，为了获得有价值的人质
They agreed obviously as a ruse to get valuable hostages.

75
00:06:28,496 --> 00:06:30,891
人质？出于什么目的？
Hostages? For what purpose?

76
00:06:31,377 --> 00:06:33,425
迫使议会满足他们的要求
To force the council to meet their demands.

77
00:06:35,386 --> 00:06:38,778
立即组织搜索小队并找到天顶石货物
Organize a search party immediately and find the zenite consignment.

78
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:44,591
同时，舰长，我建议你和大副史波克
Meanwhile, Captain, I would suggest that you and First Officer Spock

79
00:06:45,162 --> 00:06:46,556
来我们斯特拉托斯做客
be our guests on Stratos.

80
00:06:46,977 --> 00:06:51,435
很好，我希望搜索尽快完成，顾问先生
Very well. I do hope the search will be brief, Mr. Advisor.

81
00:06:51,776 --> 00:06:54,330
我们将尽一切努力，来吧，先生们
We'll do everything possible to make it so. Come, gentlemen.

82
00:07:07,469 --> 00:07:08,365
非同凡响
Remarkable.

83
00:07:11,557 --> 00:07:15,653
我见过的持续反重力上升的最佳案例
The finest example of sustained anti-gravity elevation I've seen.

84
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:34,388
哨兵告诉我有贵客，父亲
The sentinel told me of our honored guests, my father.

85
00:07:34,388 --> 00:07:35,893
我是来问候的
I came to extend greetings.

86
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:37,125
非常有礼貌
A most gracious act.

87
00:07:38,093 --> 00:07:40,856
先生们，我们星球上最无与伦比的艺术作品之一
Gentlemen, one of our planet's most incomparable works of art.

88
00:07:41,414 --> 00:07:42,462
我的女儿卓克辛
My daughter Droxine.

89
00:07:42,953 --> 00:07:44,008
詹姆斯·柯克舰长
Captain James Kirk.

90
00:07:44,627 --> 00:07:45,249
很荣幸，女士
Pleasure, madam.

91
00:07:45,596 --> 00:07:46,721
@确实，是的，舰长
Indeed, yes, Captain.

92
00:07:47,354 --> 00:07:48,762
以及大副史波克
And First Officer Spock.

93
00:07:52,444 --> 00:07:54,912
我以前从未见过瓦肯人，先生
I have never before met a Vulcan, sir.

94
00:07:56,022 --> 00:07:58,006
我也不是艺术品，女士
Nor I a work of art, madam.

95
00:07:59,928 --> 00:08:02,040
来吧，先生们，我们的城市有很多值得看的
Come, gentlemen. There is much to see in our city.

96
00:08:02,336 --> 00:08:06,549
这是我们的议会画廊，它对所有城市居民开放
This is our council gallery. It is open to all city dwellers.

97
00:08:07,126 --> 00:08:11,182
我们把各种艺术形式中最优秀一些汇集在这里
We have some of the finest of our various art forms assembled here

98
00:08:11,182 --> 00:08:13,423
以供观看和思考…
for the viewing and contemplation of every

99
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:18,261
又是破坏者！
Disruptors again!

100
00:08:18,408 --> 00:08:20,850
真可怕！他们正在掠夺整个城市
How dreadful! They're despoiling the whole city!

101
00:08:21,505 --> 00:08:24,024
掠夺？出于什么目的？
Despoil? For what purpose?

102
00:08:24,283 --> 00:08:26,328
通过让我们陷入持续混乱
By keeping us in constant turmoil,

103
00:08:26,936 --> 00:08:29,330
他们希望迫使议会接受他们的要求
they hope to force the council to accede to their demands.

104
00:08:29,677 --> 00:08:30,402
他们的诉求是什么？
What are their demands?

105
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:32,132
完全不合理，舰长
Completely unreasonable, Captain,

106
00:08:32,418 --> 00:08:33,988
但无需你担心
but nothing you need be concerned with.

107
00:08:34,443 --> 00:08:37,955
我必须要关心，如果它影响到向天璇二运送天顶石的话
I must concern myself with it if it should interfere with the delivery of zenite to Merak II.

108
00:08:38,428 --> 00:08:42,793
顾问先生，植物生命是那个星球上氧气的唯一来源
Mr. Advisor, the plant life is the source of oxygen on that planet.

109
00:08:43,162 --> 00:08:45,374
显然，如果所有植物生命都被摧毁
Obviously, if all plant life is destroyed,

110
00:08:45,725 --> 00:08:47,390
类人生命也将随之消失
the humanoid life will follow.

111
00:08:48,144 --> 00:08:50,768
我向你们保证，先生们，你们会如愿以偿
I assure you, gentlemen, you will get what you came for.

112
00:08:51,123 --> 00:08:53,811
但愿如此，阿尔达纳是联邦成员
I hope so. Ardana is a member of the Federation.

113
00:08:54,388 --> 00:08:57,141
而你们的议会有责任确保没有东西
And it is your council's responsibility that nothing interferes

114
00:08:57,410 --> 00:08:59,800
干扰其对联邦其他成员的义务
with its obligation to another member of the Federation.

115
00:09:00,375 --> 00:09:02,233
当然，我们承担责任
Of course, and we accept the responsibility.

116
00:09:02,779 --> 00:09:05,382
他们为什么要破坏艺术？
Why do they destroy art forms?

117
00:09:05,937 --> 00:09:07,086
那是大家的损失
That is a loss to everyone.

118
00:09:07,616 --> 00:09:09,412
艺术对破坏者来说毫无意义
Art means nothing to the Disruptors.

119
00:09:09,819 --> 00:09:12,167
这是他们理解的唯一形式
This is the only form they understand.

120
00:09:13,065 --> 00:09:17,225
你们的到来引起的骚乱令人疲倦
The disturbances accompanying your arrival have been most wearying.

121
00:09:17,369 --> 00:09:18,538
毫无疑问你们需要休息
No doubt you would like to rest. -

122
00:09:19,184 --> 00:09:21,143
那再好不过了
That would be most welcome.

123
00:09:21,522 --> 00:09:23,014
卧室已为你们准备好
Chambers have been prepared for you.

124
00:09:23,749 --> 00:09:25,035
哨兵会带你们去
A sentinel will guide you to them.

125
00:09:36,102 --> 00:09:40,262
我很难过他们第一次访问我们星球就受到了如此恶劣的对待
I'm sorry they were so poorly treated on their first visit to our planet.

126
00:09:41,107 --> 00:09:43,667
幸好他们没有受重伤
It's fortunate they were not seriously hurt.

127
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:45,392
哦，是的，要是那样就太尴尬了
Oh, yes, that would have been dreadful.

128
00:09:46,065 --> 00:09:51,920
进一步的暴力可能会在阿尔达纳和联邦之间创造极大的困难
Further violence could create grave difficulties between Ardana and the Federation.

129
00:09:52,983 --> 00:09:57,655
破坏者们一定是疯了才会攻击两个这样迷人的陌生人
The Disruptors must be mad to attack two such charming strangers.

130
00:09:58,222 --> 00:10:00,526
他们每天都变得更加勇敢和坚定
They grow more daring and determined every day.

131
00:10:01,431 --> 00:10:04,005
现在他们谋求在银河系中寻找盟友
Now they seek to find allies in the galaxy.

132
00:10:05,327 --> 00:10:09,659
你认为柯克舰长和他非常有魅力的大副
Do you think that Captain Kirk and his very attractive officer

133
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,896
会觉得我们要为他们的受伤负责吗？
will feel that we're responsible for their injuries?

134
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:16,632
我还一直以为你担心我们的外交关系
All this time I thought you were worried about our diplomatic relations.

135
00:10:20,997 --> 00:10:24,517
抱歉，顾问，但是这个特罗格莱特被抓到离开城市
Apologies, Mr. Advisor, but this Troglyte was apprehended leaving the city.

136
00:10:24,837 --> 00:10:27,680
他没有通行证，所以我想你会想要审问他
He is without a transport card so we thought you would want to question him.

137
00:10:28,098 --> 00:10:29,047
取下他的面罩
Remove his shields.

138
00:10:31,568 --> 00:10:33,737
你在斯特拉托斯是干什么的，特罗格莱特？
What is your business in Stratos, Troglyte?

139
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,994
说！我命令你
Speak! I command you.

140
00:10:42,981 --> 00:10:44,375
我的工作是修理
My business is to repair.

141
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:45,554
修理什么？
Repair what?

142
00:10:47,205 --> 00:10:48,842
有损坏的入口面板
There are damaged entrance panels.

143
00:10:48,889 --> 00:10:49,474
的确
Indeed.

144
00:10:50,451 --> 00:10:51,869
那么你一定有维修许可证
Then you must have a repair permit.

145
00:10:52,187 --> 00:10:52,687
在哪里？
Where is it?

146
00:10:54,048 --> 00:10:54,764
忘了
It was forgotten.

147
00:10:55,063 --> 00:10:57,650
你是不是也忘了你的通行证？
Did you also forget your transport card?

148
00:10:59,671 --> 00:11:01,591
你的哨兵攻击我时弄丢了
It was lost when your sentinels attacked me.

149
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:04,126
你的洞穴工具丢在哪里了？
And where was your cavern implement lost?

150
00:11:06,673 --> 00:11:08,380
有没有可能是这个？
Could this perhaps be it?

151
00:11:09,718 --> 00:11:11,150
我是来修理的
I came to make repairs.

152
00:11:11,594 --> 00:11:12,847
你可以修理
And you shall make them,

153
00:11:13,591 --> 00:11:15,242
告诉我们破坏者的名字
by giving us the names of the Disruptors.

154
00:11:16,052 --> 00:11:16,692
我什么都不知道
I know nothing.

155
00:11:18,007 --> 00:11:20,451
我建议你多了解一下
I would advise you to increase your knowledge.

156
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:22,903
这对于特罗格莱特来说是不可能的
That is not possible for a Troglyte.

157
00:11:23,755 --> 00:11:26,539
斯特拉托斯城的居民已经说过了
The Stratos city dwellers have said it.

158
00:11:28,185 --> 00:11:29,467
把他固定在讲台上
Secure him to the rostrum.

159
00:11:34,327 --> 00:11:37,100
[SCREAMING]
[尖叫]

160
00:11:38,957 --> 00:11:40,356
多么的不幸
How unfortunate.

161
00:11:42,119 --> 00:11:43,757
多么的不幸啊
How unfortunate.

162
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:55,198
[思考]这是一个反差非常强烈的动荡的星球
[THINKING] This troubled planet is a place of the most violent contrasts.

163
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:57,677
那些接受回报的人
Those who receive the rewards

164
00:11:58,154 --> 00:12:01,009
与那些肩负重担的人是完全分开的
are totally separated from those who shoulder the burdens.

165
00:12:01,901 --> 00:12:03,365
这不是一个明智的领导
It is not a wise leadership.

166
00:12:04,932 --> 00:12:08,173
在斯特拉托斯上，一切都是无与伦比的美丽和愉悦
Here on Stratos, everything is incomparably beautiful and pleasant.

167
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:13,238
高级顾问的迷人女儿，卓克辛，尤其如此
The high advisor's charming daughter, Droxine, particularly so.

168
00:12:14,609 --> 00:12:17,105
卓克辛这个名字听起来很适合她
The name Droxine seems appropriate for her.

169
00:12:18,403 --> 00:12:23,155
我想知道，她是否能保持如此纯洁和甜蜜的心灵
I wonder, can she retain such purity and sweetness of mind

170
00:12:23,819 --> 00:12:27,370
并意识到星球表面人们的生活？
and be aware of the life of the people on the surface of the planet?

171
00:12:28,689 --> 00:12:34,267
在那里，矿井的严酷生活正在给人们灌输一种痛苦的仇恨
There, the harsh life in the mines, is instilling the people with a bitter hatred.

172
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:38,680
当我们传送下来时领导袭击我们的年轻女孩
The young girl who led the attack against us when we beamed down

173
00:12:39,311 --> 00:12:41,716
充满了绝望的暴力
was filled with the violence of desperation.

174
00:12:43,713 --> 00:12:47,937
如果可爱的卓克辛认识到年轻矿工的痛苦
If the lovely Droxine knew of the young miners' misery,

175
00:12:49,031 --> 00:12:50,823
我想知道这些知识会如何影响她
I wonder how the knowledge would affect her.

176
00:13:24,917 --> 00:13:29,159
史波克先生，我以为你陪柯克舰长去了休息室
Mr. Spock! I thought you had accompanied Captain Kirk to the rest chamber.

177
00:13:29,684 --> 00:13:31,246
你的动静叫醒了我
Your movements awakened me.

178
00:13:31,545 --> 00:13:32,666
我很抱歉
My apologies.

179
00:13:33,075 --> 00:13:35,213
我没有意识到会打扰你
I did not realize they would disturb you.

180
00:13:35,517 --> 00:13:38,230
这噪音只有瓦肯人的耳朵能听到
Only Vulcan ears would find the noise discernible.

181
00:13:40,367 --> 00:13:45,487
看起来瓦肯人在很多方面都非常不同
It seems that Vulcans are fascinatingly different, in many ways.

182
00:13:47,341 --> 00:13:49,645
斯特拉托斯的居民也是如此
The same may be said of Stratos' inhabitants.

183
00:13:54,699 --> 00:13:57,496
瓦肯人的眼睛也很挑剔
Vulcan eyes are very discerning, too.

184
00:14:02,927 --> 00:14:05,231
我听说，智力上
I hear that, intellectually,

185
00:14:06,271 --> 00:14:11,455
瓦肯人与斯特拉托斯的城市居民一样高度进化
Vulcans are as highly evolved as Stratos city dwellers.

186
00:14:14,939 --> 00:14:19,799
我们确实为自己的逻辑感到自豪
We do pride ourselves on our logic.

187
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,177
又是你！
You again!

188
00:15:15,012 --> 00:15:17,188
你睡得很浅，舰长
You sleep lightly, Captain.

189
00:15:17,524 --> 00:15:19,572
是的，责任是个好老师
Yes, duty is a good teacher.

190
00:15:21,191 --> 00:15:22,983
我看你换了裁缝
I see you've changed your dressmaker.

191
00:15:23,745 --> 00:15:25,223
放开我
Release me.

192
00:15:25,878 --> 00:15:27,735
让你再次攻击我吗？那将是愚蠢的
So you can attack me again? That would be foolish.

193
00:15:29,905 --> 00:15:32,319
如果你害怕，就叫警卫，舰长
Call the guards if you're afraid, Captain.

194
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:35,254
我不怕
I'm not afraid.

195
00:15:36,351 --> 00:15:39,167
事实上，我觉得这很有趣
In fact, I find this rather enjoyable.

196
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,092
我不觉得！
I do not!

197
00:15:43,395 --> 00:15:45,168
好，我跟你做个交易
All right, I'll make a deal with you.

198
00:15:46,936 --> 00:15:49,710
你回答几个问题，我就让你起来
You answer some questions and I'll let you up.

199
00:15:55,328 --> 00:15:56,404
什么问题？
What questions?

200
00:15:58,162 --> 00:15:59,182
你先保证
Your word first.

201
00:16:03,336 --> 00:16:04,903
我会回答
I will answer.

202
00:16:20,624 --> 00:16:23,978
你每七年才交配一次吗？
You only take a mate once every seven years?

203
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:30,835
七年的周期是所有瓦肯人的固有生物学特征
The seven-year cycle is biologically inherent in all Vulcans.

204
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:37,212
在那个时候，交配超过了所有其他的动机
At that time, the mating drive outweighs all other motivations.

205
00:16:51,355 --> 00:16:56,859
史波克先生，没有什么能扰乱这个周期吗？
And is there nothing that can disturb that cycle, Mr. Spock?

206
00:17:00,649 --> 00:17:02,569
极致的女性美…
Extreme feminine beauty.

207
00:17:04,901 --> 00:17:11,791
…总是令人不安，女士
.is always disturbing, madam.

208
00:17:11,894 --> 00:17:12,470
[柯克]史波克？
[KIRK] Spock?

209
00:17:14,621 --> 00:17:16,473
我不是来杀你的，舰长
I did not come here to kill you, Captain.

210
00:17:16,609 --> 00:17:17,307
那这是为什么？
Then why this?

211
00:17:17,648 --> 00:17:18,864
挟持你
To take you hostage.

212
00:17:23,317 --> 00:17:25,342
我打扰你了吗，舰长？
Am I intruding, Captain?

213
00:17:26,198 --> 00:17:26,858
万娜
Vanna.

214
00:17:27,353 --> 00:17:28,186
卓克辛
Droxine.

215
00:17:28,551 --> 00:17:29,730
你为什么来这里？
Why have you come here?

216
00:17:30,109 --> 00:17:32,798
欢迎我们的客人，就像我在你父亲家里服侍时
To welcome our guests, as I was taught to do

217
00:17:32,826 --> 00:17:35,008
被教导的那样
when I served in your father's household.

218
00:17:35,988 --> 00:17:37,354
她伤到你了吗，舰长？
Has she injured you, Captain?

219
00:17:37,354 --> 00:17:38,261
哦，不，完全没有
Oh, no, not at all.

220
00:17:38,327 --> 00:17:40,796
事实上，她的来访很有启发性
In fact, her visit was quite enlightening.

221
00:17:41,241 --> 00:17:41,657
哦？
Oh?

222
00:17:41,709 --> 00:17:45,702
是的，似乎特罗格莱特以为企业号是来恐吓他们的
Yes, it seems the Troglytes are under the impression that the Enterprise is here to intimidate them.

223
00:17:48,772 --> 00:17:51,101
立刻派哨兵来休息室
Send a sentinel to the rest chamber immediately.

224
00:17:51,892 --> 00:17:54,324
不是以为，舰长，是事实
It is not impression, Captain. It is the truth.

225
00:17:54,525 --> 00:17:56,680
我们来这里是为了得到天顶石货物，就是这样
We're here to get that zenite consignment, and that's it.

226
00:17:57,519 --> 00:18:00,400
星舰不运输货物
Starships do not transport cargo.

227
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:02,220
在紧急情况下，他们会做任何事情
In times of emergency, they will do anything.

228
00:18:02,266 --> 00:18:04,688
而且相信我，这场植物瘟疫就是紧急情况
And believe me, this botanical plague is an emergency.

229
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:09,330
谎言不会让特罗格莱特留在洞穴中，你的星舰也不会
Lies will not keep the Troglytes in caverns and neither will your starship.

230
00:18:09,657 --> 00:18:11,992
你说话像个破坏者，万娜
You talk like a Disruptor, Vanna.

231
00:18:12,955 --> 00:18:14,381
我为我的人民说话
I speak for my people.

232
00:18:15,214 --> 00:18:18,076
他们与斯特拉托斯的居民一样有进入云城的权利
They have as much right to the clouds as the Stratos dwellers.

233
00:18:18,802 --> 00:18:21,781
斯特拉托斯是给顾问和学者的
The Stratos is for advisors and studiers.

234
00:18:23,081 --> 00:18:24,995
特罗格莱特在这里做什么？
What would Troglytes do here?

235
00:18:25,355 --> 00:18:29,069
居住，在阳光和温暖中
Live. In the sunlight and warmth,

236
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:31,103
每个人都应该这样
as everyone should.

237
00:18:31,655 --> 00:18:36,057
洞穴很温暖，你们的眼睛不习惯光线
The caverns are warm and your eyes are not accustomed to light.

238
00:18:37,208 --> 00:18:40,047
就像你的头脑不习惯逻辑一样
Just as your minds are not accustomed to logic.

239
00:18:48,457 --> 00:18:50,761
不习惯光线和温暖？
Unaccustomed to light and warmth?

240
00:18:51,872 --> 00:18:53,813
这对所有类人生物来说都是必要的
That's necessary to all humanoids.

241
00:18:53,836 --> 00:18:55,756
当然，你不会向特罗格莱特否认这一点
Surely you don't deny it to Troglytes.

242
00:18:56,353 --> 00:18:58,649
特罗格莱特是工人，舰长
The Troglytes are workers, Captain.

243
00:18:59,042 --> 00:19:00,898
你当然知道这一点
Surely you must be aware of that.

244
00:19:01,573 --> 00:19:04,487
他们从土里开采天顶石并运输
They mine zenite for shipment, till the soil.

245
00:19:05,118 --> 00:19:06,933
那些事情在这里没法做
Those things cannot be done here.

246
00:19:07,162 --> 00:19:10,643
换句话说，他们干了维持斯特拉托斯所需的所有体力活
In other words, they perform all the physical toil necessary to maintain Stratos.

247
00:19:10,956 --> 00:19:12,940
这就是他们在我们社会中的作用
That is their function in our society.

248
00:19:13,248 --> 00:19:15,769
但不允许他们分享它的好处
But they are not allowed to share its advantages.

249
00:19:15,998 --> 00:19:18,700
他们怎么能分享他们不理解的东西？
How can they share what they do not understand?

250
00:19:20,012 --> 00:19:21,209
可以教他们理解
They can be taught to understand.

251
00:19:21,246 --> 00:19:24,437
尤其是在一个以启蒙为荣的社会中
Especially in a society that prides itself in enlightenment.

252
00:19:25,068 --> 00:19:27,767
劳逸完全分离
The complete separation of toil and leisure

253
00:19:28,151 --> 00:19:32,119
给了阿尔达纳这个完美平衡的社会系统，舰长
has given Ardana this perfectly balanced social system, Captain.

254
00:19:33,029 --> 00:19:34,273
我们为什么要改变它？
Why should we change it?

255
00:19:34,807 --> 00:19:37,473
星球的表面几乎无法忍受
The surface of the planet is almost unendurable.

256
00:19:38,011 --> 00:19:40,561
将一部分人口限制在这样的困境中
To restrict a segment of the population to such hardship

257
00:19:41,042 --> 00:19:43,348
在进化的文化中是无法想象的
is unthinkable in an evolved culture.

258
00:19:44,194 --> 00:19:46,683
表面被暴力破坏
The surface is marred by violence.

259
00:19:47,539 --> 00:19:48,741
就像特罗格莱特一样
Like the Troglytes.

260
00:19:51,968 --> 00:19:56,640
在斯特拉托斯，我们已经完全消除了暴力
Here on Stratos, we have completely eliminated violence.

261
00:20:02,591 --> 00:20:05,515
你拒绝透露其他破坏者的名字？
You still refuse to disclose the names of the other Disrupters.

262
00:20:05,912 --> 00:20:08,223
没有破坏者
There are no Disruptors.

263
00:20:09,444 --> 00:20:11,628
很好，如果你喜欢光线…
Very well. If you prefer the rays.

264
00:20:20,487 --> 00:20:23,935
[史波克]特罗格莱特是一个古代地球术语的缩写，舰长
[SPOCK] Troglyte is an abbreviation of an ancient Earth term, Captain.

265
00:20:24,552 --> 00:20:27,658
它的字面意思是穴居者
Its technical translation is cave dweller.

266
00:20:28,023 --> 00:20:29,166
是的，我早应该意识到的
Yes. I should have realized.

267
00:20:29,332 --> 00:20:30,816
[尖叫]
[SCREAM]

268
00:20:40,306 --> 00:20:41,087
顾问先生！
Mr. Advisor!

269
00:20:50,045 --> 00:20:52,552
你说你要质问万娜，而不是折磨她
You said you were going to question Vanna, not torture her.

270
00:20:52,912 --> 00:20:53,618
她很固执
She's stubborn.

271
00:20:54,418 --> 00:20:56,065
而且正如你自己所指出的，舰长
And as you yourself pointed out, Captain,

272
00:20:56,598 --> 00:20:58,918
对你的天顶石货物的搜索必须很短
the search for your zenite consignment must be short.

273
00:21:03,525 --> 00:21:05,569
当然还有比这更好的方法
Surely there are better methods than this.

274
00:21:05,831 --> 00:21:08,203
身体不适是极其有说服力的，舰长
Physical discomfort is extremely persuasive, Captain.

275
00:21:08,619 --> 00:21:11,917
是的，但我不会在有人被折磨的时候袖手旁观
Yes, but I won't stand by while someone is tortured.

276
00:21:12,352 --> 00:21:16,768
放过万娜让整个星球被毁灭更可取？
Is it preferable to spare Vanna and allow an entire planet to be destroyed?

277
00:21:17,198 --> 00:21:20,781
现实中的暴力与理论大相径庭，不是吗，女士？
Violence in reality is quite different from theory, is it not, madam?

278
00:21:21,496 --> 00:21:23,998
但他们还能理解什么，史波克先生？
But what else can they understand, Mr. Spock?

279
00:21:27,469 --> 00:21:31,357
所有你我都理解并期待的生活小事
All the little things you and I understand and expect from life,

280
00:21:31,997 --> 00:21:35,232
比如平等、善良、正义
such as equality, kindness, justice.

281
00:21:35,716 --> 00:21:38,331
特罗格莱特不像斯特拉托斯居民，史波克先生
Troglytes are not like Stratos dwellers, Mr. Spock.

282
00:21:38,892 --> 00:21:41,362
它们是劣等物种的聚​​合体
They're a conglomerate of inferior species.

283
00:21:41,881 --> 00:21:44,355
知识社会的抽象概念
The abstract concepts of an intellectual society

284
00:21:44,355 --> 00:21:45,904
超出了他们的理解范围
are beyond their comprehension.

285
00:21:46,385 --> 00:21:50,929
对万娜来说，忠诚和领导力的抽象概念似乎很清楚
The abstract concepts of loyalty and leadership seem clear to Vanna.

286
00:21:51,255 --> 00:21:53,149
一些特罗格莱特作为仆人被带来这里
A few Troglytes are retainers.

287
00:21:53,224 --> 00:21:55,252
万娜是其中之一，所有的哨兵都是
Vanna was one, as all the sentinels.

288
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:57,677
他们比其他人接受了更多的培训
They've received more training than the others.

289
00:21:57,930 --> 00:21:59,375
但显然没有更多的报酬
But obviously no more consideration.

290
00:22:00,530 --> 00:22:03,538
我看不出这种持续批评的目的
I fail to see the purpose of this continued criticism.

291
00:22:03,982 --> 00:22:08,842
下次再用那个东西，不是在你身上就是在我身上
The only way you'll use that device again is on one of us.

292
00:22:09,071 --> 00:22:13,002
[轻笑]原始英勇的壮观展示，先生们
[CHUCKLES] An imposing display of primitive gallantry, gentlemen.

293
00:22:13,842 --> 00:22:16,106
你知道哨兵可以把你带走吗？
You realize the sentinels could remove you?

294
00:22:17,224 --> 00:22:17,809
当然
Of course,

295
00:22:18,964 --> 00:22:22,496
但星际舰队指挥部不会接受对其指挥人员
but starfleet command won't take kindly to having either rays or physical force

296
00:22:22,515 --> 00:22:24,984
使用射线或武力的做法，顾问先生
used against one of its command personnel, Mr. Advisor.

297
00:22:25,714 --> 00:22:29,208
你为什么这么关心这个破坏者的安危？
Why are you so concerned with this Disruptor's well-being?

298
00:22:32,202 --> 00:22:36,051
除了纯粹的人道主义之外，我的命令是拿到天顶石
Beyond plain humanitarianism, my orders are to get that zenite!

299
00:22:36,402 --> 00:22:38,633
那就别插手，我会帮你你弄到的
Then stop interfering, and I'll get it for you.

300
00:22:38,839 --> 00:22:40,422
你用酷刑弄不到！
You won't get it through torture!

301
00:22:40,766 --> 00:22:43,008
我们会给你弄到的，用我们自己的方法！
We will get it for you, and in our own way!

302
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:46,986
将犯人转移到禁闭室
Remove the prisoner to confinement quarters.

303
00:22:50,701 --> 00:22:52,429
您将立即返回您的船
You will return to your ship at once

304
00:22:53,826 --> 00:22:56,244
否则我将亲自联系星际舰队指挥部
or I shall contact your Starfleet command myself

305
00:22:57,161 --> 00:22:59,401
并报告你对本星球政府的干涉
and report your interference with this planet's government.

306
00:23:05,029 --> 00:23:05,629
[通讯器哔哔声]
[Communicator Beeps On]

307
00:23:06,371 --> 00:23:07,091
柯克呼叫企业号
Kirk to Enterprise.

308
00:23:07,975 --> 00:23:08,935
[斯科特]企业号，舰长
[SCOTT] Enterprise, Captain.

309
00:23:10,319 --> 00:23:11,582
斯科特先生，我们准备传送上去了
Mr. Scott, we're ready to beam up.

310
00:23:12,134 --> 00:23:12,695
是的，长官
Aye, sir.

311
00:23:26,391 --> 00:23:31,063
如果柯克舰长再次出现，杀了他
If Captain Kirk appears again, kill him.

312
00:23:39,315 --> 00:23:41,900
[柯克]舰长日志，星历5819.0
[KIRK] Captain's log, stardate 5819.0.

313
00:23:42,453 --> 00:23:45,532
距天顶石货物消失已经超过8个小时了
More than 8 hours have passed since the consignment of zenite disappeared

314
00:23:45,737 --> 00:23:47,145
我们仍然没有发现它的踪迹
and we have still found no trace of it.

315
00:23:47,791 --> 00:23:51,759
我们从天璇二那里得知植物瘟疫正在迅速蔓延
We received word from Merak II that the botanical  plague is spreading rapidly.

316
00:23:52,215 --> 00:23:54,775
必须在12小时内交付天顶石
Delivery of the zenite is imperative within 12 hours

317
00:23:55,242 --> 00:23:57,553
否则星球上的所有生命将被毁灭
or all life on the planet will be annihilated.

318
00:23:58,366 --> 00:24:02,384
乌乎拉上尉，通知星际舰队指挥部天顶石尚未交付
Lieutenant Uhura, advise Starfleet command that the zenite has not been delivered.

319
00:24:03,095 --> 00:24:07,090
在我看来，普拉苏斯完成交付的方法不会成功
In my opinion, Plasus' method of accomplishing delivery will not succeed.

320
00:24:07,633 --> 00:24:09,036
如果天顶石没有很快交付
If the zenite is not delivered shortly,

321
00:24:09,036 --> 00:24:12,095
我将不得不违反普拉苏斯的不干涉命令
I shall have to violate Plasus' order of noninterference

322
00:24:12,455 --> 00:24:16,017
并用理智赢得特罗格莱特领导者的信任
and win the confidence of the Troglyte leader with the use of reason.

323
00:24:16,394 --> 00:24:17,694
这可能并不容易，吉姆
That may not be easy, Jim.

324
00:24:17,872 --> 00:24:21,244
医学分析表明特罗格莱特在智力上是低等的
Medical analysis indicates Troglytes are mentally inferior.

325
00:24:21,548 --> 00:24:22,690
那不可能，老骨头
That's impossible, Bones.

326
00:24:23,008 --> 00:24:26,081
特罗格莱特接受了个人牺牲，共同事业
Troglytes have accepted personal sacrifice, a common cause.

327
00:24:26,333 --> 00:24:29,009
低等智力生物做不到这一点
Mentally inferior beings aren't capable of that.

328
00:24:29,364 --> 00:24:31,301
听着，我彻底检查了我的发现
Look, I've checked my findings thoroughly.

329
00:24:31,834 --> 00:24:34,617
他们的智力评级比平均水平低近20%
Their intellect ratings are almost 20% below average.

330
00:24:34,776 --> 00:24:35,861
他们都是同一个种族
They're all the same species.

331
00:24:36,456 --> 00:24:39,052
住在斯特拉托斯上的和住在下面的人
Those who live on Stratos and those who live below

332
00:24:39,103 --> 00:24:40,623
都起源于这个星球
all originated on the planet.

333
00:24:41,128 --> 00:24:43,682
他们的身体智力进化一定是相似的
Their physical and mental evolution must be similar.

334
00:24:44,085 --> 00:24:45,563
这是基本的生物规律
That is basic biological law.

335
00:24:45,806 --> 00:24:46,704
没错，史波克
That's true, Spock.

336
00:24:47,148 --> 00:24:49,941
但显然住在斯特拉托斯上的人的祖先
But obviously the ancestors of those who live on Stratos

337
00:24:50,016 --> 00:24:52,637
从矿井环境中搬了出来
removed themselves from the environment of the mines.

338
00:24:53,234 --> 00:24:56,260
因此，他们避免了某些自然生长的影响
Therefore they avoided the effects of certain natural growths.

339
00:24:56,723 --> 00:24:57,794
自然生长？哪一种？
Natural growths? What kind?

340
00:24:58,421 --> 00:25:00,802
我有这个从地表发来的天顶石样本
I had this zenite sample sent up from the surface.

341
00:25:01,321 --> 00:25:04,801
未密封，它会对这里所有人产生有害影响
Now, unsealed, it would have had detrimental effects on everybody here.

342
00:25:05,185 --> 00:25:08,155
不可思议！天顶石被运往整个银河系
Incredible! zenite is shipped all over the galaxy

343
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:10,559
任何有植物细菌危险的地方
wherever there's danger of plant bacteria.

344
00:25:11,233 --> 00:25:13,240
没有报告有副作用
No side effects have been reported.

345
00:25:13,576 --> 00:25:15,134
提纯后就没有了
There are none after it's refined.

346
00:25:15,471 --> 00:25:16,664
但在未经加工的状态下
But in its raw state,

347
00:25:17,038 --> 00:25:19,760
它会散发出一种无味、看不见的气体
it emits an odourless, invisible gas

348
00:25:19,789 --> 00:25:24,490
这会阻碍大脑智力功能并增强情绪
that retards the intellectual functioning of the mind and heightens the emotional.

349
00:25:25,373 --> 00:25:28,694
因此，它会释放出剧烈的反应
Therefore, it releases a violent reaction.

350
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:31,232
矿井里充满了这种气体
And the mines are full of that gas.

351
00:25:31,870 --> 00:25:34,512
对，特罗格莱特经常暴露在它之下
Right. And Troglytes are constantly exposed to it.

352
00:25:34,943 --> 00:25:38,718
老骨头，破坏者，万娜，似乎不可能
Bones, the Disruptors, Vanna. It seems impossible.

353
00:25:39,139 --> 00:25:42,145
几个月来，他们已经智胜了一种高度组织的科学文化
They've outwitted a highly organized, scientific culture for months.

354
00:25:42,862 --> 00:25:47,086
作为斯特拉托斯的一部分，万娜长期避免了暴露
As part of Stratos, Vanna was removed from exposure for a long period.

355
00:25:47,554 --> 00:25:51,154
如果没有曝光，效果就会慢慢消失
It is likely that without such exposure, the effect slowly wears off.

356
00:25:51,670 --> 00:25:52,390
没错，史波克
That's right.

357
00:25:52,414 --> 00:25:55,407
其他破坏者也可能已避免了暴露
The other Disrupters were probably removed from exposure too.

358
00:25:56,783 --> 00:25:57,840
大脑恢复正常了吗？
Does the brain return to normal?

359
00:25:58,345 --> 00:25:59,603
根据发现，应该会
According to findings, it should.

360
00:25:59,973 --> 00:26:01,123
你能中和气体吗？
Can you neutralize the gas?

361
00:26:01,685 --> 00:26:03,832
不，但过滤面罩有效
No, but a filter mask should remove the exposure.

362
00:26:04,098 --> 00:26:05,502
找一个，和我们在传送室碰头
Find one. Meet us in the transporter room.

363
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:11,493
这种面具能自动消除所有对类人生命有伤害的物质
This mask automatically eliminates all substance injurious to humanoid life

364
00:26:11,531 --> 00:26:12,929
包括化学物质和细菌
chemical as well as bacterial.

365
00:26:13,379 --> 00:26:15,619
我们经常使用过滤面具来…
We've used filter masks frequently on.

366
00:26:15,666 --> 00:26:18,005
你真的希望我相信那面具
And do you really expect me to believe that that mask

367
00:26:18,716 --> 00:26:21,316
可以为特罗格莱特带来智力平等吗？
can achieve intellectual equality for the Troglytes?

368
00:26:21,952 --> 00:26:24,640
有各种迹象表明，这种气体的影响是暂时的
There's every indication that the effect of the gas is temporary,

369
00:26:24,927 --> 00:26:26,476
即使是在反复接触之后
even after repeated exposure.

370
00:26:26,953 --> 00:26:28,810
仅靠一个过滤器怎么能完成
How can a mere filter accomplish

371
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:31,293
几个世纪进化所没能做到的事情呢？
what centuries of evolution have failed to do?

372
00:26:31,565 --> 00:26:34,301
麦考伊医生彻底分析了天顶石
Dr. McCoy has analyzed the zenite thoroughly.

373
00:26:34,731 --> 00:26:36,579
我们用电脑检查了他的发现
We've checked his findings through the computer.

374
00:26:36,649 --> 00:26:37,720
结果是有效的
And they're absolutely valid.

375
00:26:37,954 --> 00:26:40,854
你的计算机是否解释了我的祖先如何
Do your computers explain how my ancestors,

376
00:26:40,878 --> 00:26:42,372
他们也曾住在洞穴中
who also dwelt in caverns,

377
00:26:42,847 --> 00:26:45,116
进化到足以建立斯特拉托斯
evolved sufficiently to erect Stratos,

378
00:26:46,074 --> 00:26:47,460
而特罗格莱特却没有？
while the Troglytes did not?

379
00:26:48,525 --> 00:26:50,200
不平等的进化
Unequal evolution did not begin

380
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:55,635
直到你的祖先避免持续暴露在气体中才开始，顾问先生
until after your ancestors removed themselves from constant exposure to the gas, Mr. Advisor.

381
00:26:56,187 --> 00:26:57,845
啊，荒谬！
Ah, preposterous!

382
00:26:58,283 --> 00:27:00,051
现在没时间争论发现了
There's no time to argue about the findings now.

383
00:27:00,051 --> 00:27:01,506
我只是提议告诉万娜这一切
I simply propose to tell Vanna all about them.

384
00:27:01,852 --> 00:27:04,477
我怀疑即使是万娜也不会相信这种无稽之谈
I doubt whether even Vanna will believe such nonsense!

385
00:27:04,794 --> 00:27:07,939
这种无稽之谈可能对特罗格莱特意义重大
This nonsense might mean a great deal to the Troglytes.

386
00:27:08,204 --> 00:27:12,547
我想向他们提供这些过滤面具，以换取天顶石货物
I would like to offer them a supply of these filter masks in exchange for the zenite consignment.

387
00:27:13,486 --> 00:27:14,434
对不起，舰长
I'm sorry, Captain.

388
00:27:15,608 --> 00:27:18,331
这样的提议只会在他们中间引起更多的不安
Such an offer could only cause more unrest among them.

389
00:27:19,229 --> 00:27:21,953
在我们的科学家核查发现之前，我不允许
I cannot allow it until our scientists have checked the findings.

390
00:27:22,353 --> 00:27:23,401
那可能要花几天时间
That could take days.

391
00:27:23,752 --> 00:27:25,342
你是怕口罩有用吗？
Are you afraid the masks will work?

392
00:27:25,342 --> 00:27:26,857
所以你不想让特罗格莱特试试
Is that why you don't want the Troglytes to try them?

393
00:27:27,372 --> 00:27:29,575
你来这里是为了完成紧急任务
You are here to complete an emergency mission,

394
00:27:29,884 --> 00:27:31,379
而不是进行测试，舰长
not conduct tests, Captain.

395
00:27:31,807 --> 00:27:32,959
我是来拿天顶石的！
I'm here to get zenite!

396
00:27:33,603 --> 00:27:35,090
如果这些能帮我们拿到，那我就会用
If these will help me get them, I'll use them.

397
00:27:35,287 --> 00:27:36,161
而我禁止！
And I forbid it!

398
00:27:37,148 --> 00:27:39,347
你的联邦命令没有赋予你
Your Federation orders do not entitle you

399
00:27:39,553 --> 00:27:40,811
挑战地方政府的权利
to defy local governments.

400
00:27:41,933 --> 00:27:43,789
这次通讯到此结束
This communication has ended.

401
00:27:47,752 --> 00:27:51,186
我的外交手段有些不足
My diplomacy is somewhat inadequate.

402
00:27:51,766 --> 00:27:53,725
哦，克服偏见是相当困难的
Oh, it's pretty hard to overcome prejudice.

403
00:27:53,964 --> 00:27:55,138
没有给我们太多选择，不是吗？
Doesn't give us much choice, does it?

404
00:27:55,278 --> 00:27:56,078
也没有时间
Nor time.

405
00:27:56,265 --> 00:27:59,694
我们有10小时40分钟把那批货物运送到天璇二
We have 1 0 hours and 40 minutes to deliver that consignment to Merak ll.

406
00:28:00,976 --> 00:28:02,512
把我送到万娜的禁闭室
Beam me down to Vanna's confinement quarters.

407
00:28:02,655 --> 00:28:05,265
你是说你要违反政府命令返回斯特拉托斯？
You mean you're going back to Stratos against government orders?

408
00:28:05,555 --> 00:28:07,987
如果万娜没有为她的人民获得明确的好处
If Vanna doesn't have something definite to gain for her people,

409
00:28:08,011 --> 00:28:10,574
她宁愿死，也不愿交出那批天顶石货物
she'll die rather than turn over that zenite consignment.

410
00:28:10,667 --> 00:28:12,045
这是唯一能说服她的东西
This is the only thing that might convince her.

411
00:28:12,445 --> 00:28:12,997
舰长
Captain.

412
00:28:13,306 --> 00:28:14,653
如果你被逮到
If you are apprehended

413
00:28:14,854 --> 00:28:17,207
故意违反高级顾问的命令
deliberately violating the high advisor's orders,

414
00:28:17,389 --> 00:28:19,927
如果他愿意，他将有权处决你
he will be within his rights to have you executed, if he chooses.

415
00:28:20,719 --> 00:28:23,418
如果你是在暗示由你来联系万娜
If you're about to suggest that you contact Vanna,

416
00:28:23,418 --> 00:28:24,480
回答是否定的，史波克
the answer's no, Spock.

417
00:28:24,541 --> 00:28:25,475
你也是，老骨头
That goes for you too, Bones.

418
00:28:25,804 --> 00:28:29,354
我想指出的是大副
I'll point out that a first officer is more expendable

419
00:28:29,354 --> 00:28:31,314
比医生或舰长更值得牺牲
than either a doctor or a captain.

420
00:28:31,763 --> 00:28:33,873
官方来说，是的。但这个任务是完全非官方的
Officially, yes. But this mission is strictly unofficial.

421
00:28:33,938 --> 00:28:36,936
没人会参与其中或为其负责，除了我自己
Nobody's to have any part in it, any responsibility for it, but myself.

422
00:28:37,376 --> 00:28:38,050
这是命令，史波克
That's an order, Spock.

423
00:28:41,127 --> 00:28:41,824
你来掌舵
You have the conn.

424
00:28:43,859 --> 00:28:44,947
待命，等我联系你
Stand by till I contact you.

425
00:28:45,333 --> 00:28:50,445
[机器哔哔声，蜂鸣]
[Machine Beeps, Beaming]

426
00:28:58,865 --> 00:28:59,295
瓦娜…
Vanna.

427
00:29:02,321 --> 00:29:03,358
我给你带了一个礼物
I've brought you a gift.

428
00:29:04,698 --> 00:29:06,874
矿井里有危险气体
There's a dangerous gas in the mines

429
00:29:07,527 --> 00:29:12,074
会影响暴露在其中一段时间的特罗格莱特的发育
that affects the development of the Troglytes exposed to it for a period of time.

430
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,770
这个面具将防止进一步的伤害
This mask will prevent any further damage.

431
00:29:18,314 --> 00:29:19,726
来自天顶石的气体？
Gas from zenite?

432
00:29:19,918 --> 00:29:20,391
是的
Yes.

433
00:29:21,911 --> 00:29:25,868
很难相信看不见摸不着的东西会造成这么大的伤害
It's hard to believe something neither seen nor felt can do so much harm.

434
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:28,679
没错，但想法也是看不见摸不着的
That's true. But an idea can't be seen or felt.

435
00:29:28,773 --> 00:29:32,117
它让特罗格莱特被困在矿井里好几个世纪
That's what's kept the Troglytes in the mines all these centuries.

436
00:29:32,655 --> 00:29:33,937
一个错误的想法
A mistaken idea.

437
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:38,956
所有特罗格莱特都会戴这些面具吗？
Would all the Troglytes wear these masks?

438
00:29:39,166 --> 00:29:41,968
是的，我会确保联邦工程师制造它们
Yes. I'll see to it that Federation engineers construct them.

439
00:29:44,246 --> 00:29:46,239
要是普拉苏斯不同意？
Suppose Plasus does not agree?

440
00:29:46,879 --> 00:29:48,182
普拉苏斯不是整个政府
Plasus is not the whole government.

441
00:29:49,312 --> 00:29:49,952
确实如此
That is true,

442
00:29:50,827 --> 00:29:55,037
但市议会不会听取特罗格莱特的意见
but the city council will not listen to Troglytes.

443
00:29:55,224 --> 00:29:57,226
一旦天顶石被送到天璇二
As soon as the zenite is delivered to Merak II,

444
00:29:58,367 --> 00:29:59,116
我就会回来
I'll come back.

445
00:29:59,247 --> 00:30:03,513
我会请求为特罗格莱特进行调解的许可，万娜
I'll request permission to mediate for the Troglytes. Vanna.

446
00:30:06,258 --> 00:30:07,218
你必须相信我
You must trust me.

447
00:30:10,552 --> 00:30:11,362
我向你保证
I give you my word.

448
00:30:13,532 --> 00:30:14,514
几个世纪前
Centuries ago,

449
00:30:15,047 --> 00:30:17,615
建造斯特拉托斯的领导们保证
Stratos was built by leaders that gave their word

450
00:30:18,238 --> 00:30:20,024
所有居民都将住在那里
that all inhabitants would live there.

451
00:30:20,637 --> 00:30:22,405
特罗格莱特仍在等待
The Troglytes are still waiting.

452
00:30:22,653 --> 00:30:24,187
天顶石可在数小时内交付
The zenite can be delivered in hours.

453
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:25,595
现在你不会等太久
You won't have long to wait now.

454
00:30:26,096 --> 00:30:27,858
几个小时可能是几个世纪
Hours can be centuries.

455
00:30:28,556 --> 00:30:30,600
就像承诺可能是谎言一样
Just as words can be lies.

456
00:30:32,322 --> 00:30:32,944
万娜…
Vanna.

457
00:30:35,806 --> 00:30:36,773
你必须相信我
you must trust me.

458
00:30:38,557 --> 00:30:41,569
如果你不这样做，数百万人将死去，一整个星球！
If you don't, millions of people will die. A whole planet!

459
00:30:41,971 --> 00:30:43,445
天顶石是唯一能拯救他们的东西
Zenite is all that can save them.

460
00:30:44,123 --> 00:30:47,241
过滤面具是唯一能拯救特罗格莱特的东西
The filter mask is all that can save the Troglytes.

461
00:30:51,771 --> 00:30:52,411
相信我
Trust me.

462
00:30:54,385 --> 00:30:55,217
拜托
Please.

463
00:31:00,129 --> 00:31:01,409
好吧，舰长
Very well, Captain.

464
00:31:02,903 --> 00:31:03,758
我会相信你
I will trust you.

465
00:31:04,999 --> 00:31:07,375
这批货物位于矿井深处
The consignment lies deep in the mines

466
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:09,543
只有特罗格莱特知道的地方
in a place known only to Troglytes.

467
00:31:10,317 --> 00:31:11,374
我不能告诉你怎么走
I cannot direct you.

468
00:31:11,711 --> 00:31:12,576
我必须带你去那里
I must take you there.

469
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:17,136
你要求我的信任，舰长
You asked for my trust, Captain.

470
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,873
你不愿意给我你的吗？
Are you unwilling to give yours?

471
00:31:26,263 --> 00:31:27,991
是给我送茶点的哨兵
It's the sentinel with my refreshment.

472
00:31:52,635 --> 00:31:56,219
等待，我们需要一张通行证才能离开这座城市
Wait. We'll need a transport pass to leave the city.

473
00:32:35,130 --> 00:32:35,724
米德罗
Midro.

474
00:32:35,977 --> 00:32:36,475
万娜
Vanna.

475
00:32:36,762 --> 00:32:37,338
安卡
Anka. -

476
00:32:37,394 --> 00:32:38,418
你回来了
You have returned.

477
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:41,296
而且我还带了一个人质，抓住他！
And I've brought with me a hostage. Seize him!

478
00:32:43,545 --> 00:32:44,831
我们说好的，你为什么反悔？
We had a bargain. Why did you break it?

479
00:32:45,135 --> 00:32:48,271
你真的以为我会信任你吗，舰长？
Did you really think I would trust you, Captain?

480
00:32:48,654 --> 00:32:50,605
我没那么傻
I'm not such a fool.

481
00:32:51,674 --> 00:32:52,498
我信了你
I trusted you.

482
00:32:52,685 --> 00:32:54,537
你以为你能用你的长篇大论骗过我
You thought you would trick me with your talk

483
00:32:54,537 --> 00:32:57,227
说什么过滤器和看不见的气体来欺骗我
of your filter and your unseen gas.

484
00:32:57,409 --> 00:32:59,958
我比普拉苏斯更不相信你
I don't believe you any more than Plasus.

485
00:33:00,697 --> 00:33:01,670
那你就是个傻瓜
Then you are a fool.

486
00:33:01,726 --> 00:33:03,855
正如我所说，这些面具能解放你们
These masks will free you, as I said.

487
00:33:04,028 --> 00:33:05,796
我们的武器就是我们的自由
Our weapons are our freedom

488
00:33:06,236 --> 00:33:10,038
你刚刚给我提供了两个非常有价值的东西
and you've just furnished me with two very valuable ones.

489
00:33:10,544 --> 00:33:12,790
你和这个
Yourself and this.

490
00:33:13,144 --> 00:33:14,384
抓我对你没有帮助
Holding me won't help you.

491
00:33:14,473 --> 00:33:16,320
我的人还是会来找天顶石货物
My men will still come for that zenite consignment.

492
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:18,215
没有你的通讯器
Without your communicator,

493
00:33:18,982 --> 00:33:20,646
很难定位到你
you will be hard to locate.

494
00:33:21,017 --> 00:33:21,943
他们还是会来的
They'll still come.

495
00:33:22,134 --> 00:33:22,902
也许吧
Perhaps.

496
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:27,408
同时，体验一下我们的生活方式，舰长
In the meantime, a taste of our existence, Captain.

497
00:33:28,748 --> 00:33:30,400
像特罗格莱特一样挖掘
Dig as the Troglytes do.

498
00:33:31,316 --> 00:33:32,093
像特罗格莱特一样
As the Troglytes do.

499
00:33:32,093 --> 00:33:33,053
没有那个面具，我…
Without that mask, I haven't.

500
00:33:40,311 --> 00:33:42,982
用你的双手，舰长
With your bare hands, Captain.

501
00:33:58,161 --> 00:34:01,323
[史波克]舰长日志补充，星历5819.3
[SPOCK] Captain's log supplemental, stardate 5819.3.

502
00:34:01,370 --> 00:34:02,978
副驾驶史波克报告
First Officer Spock reporting.

503
00:34:03,535 --> 00:34:05,481
柯克舰长传送到斯特拉托斯
Captain Kirk beamed down to Stratos

504
00:34:05,481 --> 00:34:08,651
试图赢得叛军特罗格莱特的信任
to attempt to win the confidence of the rebel Troglytes.

505
00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:12,114
除非他从斯特拉托斯逃到了矿井
Unless he has made his escape from Stratos to the mines,

506
00:34:12,376 --> 00:34:14,680
否则他的生命受到高级顾问的威胁
his life is in danger from the high advisor.

507
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:17,872
舰长没有通知我们他的进展
The captain has not informed us of his progress.

508
00:34:18,653 --> 00:34:21,539
就我们而言，我们必须保持沉默
For our part, we must maintain silence.

509
00:34:21,983 --> 00:34:25,631
在不危及他生命的情况下，我们不能帮助他
We can be of no help to him without jeopardizing his life.

510
00:34:27,073 --> 00:34:28,401
你挖得不错，舰长
You dig well, Captain.

511
00:34:29,154 --> 00:34:31,778
看不见的气体似乎没有伤害你
The unseen gas doesn't seem to be harming you.

512
00:34:31,890 --> 00:34:33,668
需要一段时间才能注意到它的效果
It takes a while for its effects to be noticed.

513
00:34:33,855 --> 00:34:35,583
尽管如此，你不需要这个
Nevertheless, you won't need this.

514
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:39,286
安卡，把这个放在传送平台上
Anka, deposit this on the transport platform,

515
00:34:39,688 --> 00:34:41,049
这样普拉苏斯会知道
so Plasus will know

516
00:34:41,049 --> 00:34:43,467
我们有更有价值的东西可以讨价还价
we have something more valuable to bargain with

517
00:34:43,968 --> 00:34:45,888
比起我们的凿和镐
than our mortaes and thongs.

518
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:48,618
你很聪明，万娜，非常聪明
You are clever, Vanna, very clever.

519
00:34:51,948 --> 00:34:53,664
搜索者很快就会来，米德罗
Searchers will be coming soon, Midro.

520
00:34:53,964 --> 00:34:56,840
去其他矿井，告诉他们派驻哨兵
Go to other mines and tell them to post watchers.

521
00:34:57,032 --> 00:34:57,855
他呢？
What of him?

522
00:34:58,908 --> 00:35:01,172
我将确保他不会逃跑
I will see that he doesn't escape.

523
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,875
如果我们杀了他，就没有必要看守了
If we kill him, there will be no need to.

524
00:35:04,395 --> 00:35:07,323
一个死的人质毫无价值，米德罗
A dead hostage is of no value, Midro.

525
00:35:07,552 --> 00:35:09,086
只有特罗格莱特会知道
Only the Troglytes will know.

526
00:35:09,685 --> 00:35:10,653
我带他来的
I brought him here.

527
00:35:10,653 --> 00:35:12,715
我来决定做什么
I will say what is to be done.

528
00:35:13,090 --> 00:35:14,690
你不是唯一的破坏者
You are not the only Disruptor.

529
00:35:15,209 --> 00:35:16,364
我也可以决定
I, too, can say.

530
00:35:17,141 --> 00:35:18,577
除了争吵，你还能做什么？
Can you do nothing but argue?

531
00:35:18,857 --> 00:35:20,429
搜索者很快就会到这里
The searchers will be here soon.

532
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:25,664
@当安卡回来时，我们都会说
When Anka returns, we will all say.

533
00:35:31,959 --> 00:35:33,765
这就是你在讨价还价的东西？
Is that what you're bargaining for?

534
00:35:34,621 --> 00:35:35,837
杀死所有人的权利？
The right to kill everyone?

535
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:37,764
米德罗很幼稚
Midro is a child.

536
00:35:38,316 --> 00:35:40,150
面具可以改变这种情况
The masks can change that.

537
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:42,606
回去挖你的矿，舰长
Return to the digging, Captain.

538
00:35:48,854 --> 00:35:50,334
你打算让我在这里呆多久？
How long do you plan to keep me here,

539
00:35:50,524 --> 00:35:52,704
当然前提是米德罗不杀我
providing Midro doesn't kill me of course.

540
00:35:53,378 --> 00:35:55,136
直到我们在矿井里得到帮助
Until we have help in the mines

541
00:35:55,838 --> 00:35:58,219
并在云城中有一席之地
and our homes are in the clouds.

542
00:36:00,352 --> 00:36:01,526
那是相当长的时间
That's quite a while.

543
00:36:02,934 --> 00:36:04,141
比我预期的要长
Longer than I expected.

544
00:36:41,598 --> 00:36:42,750
我们被封在里面了
We're sealed in.

545
00:36:43,703 --> 00:36:44,407
完全被封了
Completely.

546
00:36:46,935 --> 00:36:49,436
但很快大气就会用完，我们会死的
But soon the atmosphere will go. We'll die.

547
00:36:49,765 --> 00:36:51,365
死于看不见的东西？
Die from something that can't be seen?

548
00:36:51,365 --> 00:36:52,389
你让我大吃一惊，万娜
You astound me, Vanna.

549
00:36:53,933 --> 00:36:54,714
柯克呼叫企业号
Kirk to Enterprise.

550
00:36:56,103 --> 00:36:57,895
企业号，请回答，柯克呼叫企业号
Enterprise, come in. Kirk to Enterprise.

551
00:36:58,199 --> 00:36:59,354
企业号，请回答
Enterprise, come in.

552
00:37:00,799 --> 00:37:01,824
柯克呼叫企业号
Kirk to Enterprise.

553
00:37:02,259 --> 00:37:03,059
我是史波克
Spock here.

554
00:37:03,171 --> 00:37:04,794
我们一直在试图联系你，舰长
We've been trying to make contact, Captain.

555
00:37:04,925 --> 00:37:05,753
有什么问题吗？
Is anything wrong?

556
00:37:05,912 --> 00:37:07,675
没有什么，史波克先生，你锁定我了吗？
Nothing, Mr. Spock. Are you locked in on me?

557
00:37:08,096 --> 00:37:10,075
已锁定，准备传送货物
Locked in, and ready to beam up consignment.

558
00:37:10,332 --> 00:37:13,502
情况有一点变化，史波克
Circumstances dictate a slight variation, Spock.

559
00:37:14,664 --> 00:37:16,062
等待指示中
Standing by for instructions.

560
00:37:16,773 --> 00:37:18,031
保存这些坐标
Hold on these coordinates.

561
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:22,784
定位高级顾问并立即将他传送到这些坐标来
Locate the high advisor and beam him to these coordinates immediately.

562
00:37:23,294 --> 00:37:25,764
无需提前沟通，再说一遍
Without advance communication. Repeat.

563
00:37:26,278 --> 00:37:28,720
无需提前沟通
Without advance communication.

564
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:29,533
听到了吗，史波克？
Have you got that, Spock?

565
00:37:29,758 --> 00:37:30,867
指示明确
Instructions clear.

566
00:37:30,867 --> 00:37:32,787
我会立即执行
I shall carry them out immediately.

567
00:37:33,411 --> 00:37:34,029
通话完毕
Spock out.

568
00:37:36,503 --> 00:37:39,015
你要把普拉苏斯也关进来？
You would seal Plasus here also?

569
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:41,751
目的是什么？
For what purpose?

570
00:37:42,369 --> 00:37:44,632
我正在准备一场演示
I'm preparing a demonstration

571
00:37:46,508 --> 00:37:49,432
关于没人相信的气体的影响
on the effects of unbelieved gas.

572
00:37:54,918 --> 00:37:57,755
他说在没有警告的情况下把高级顾问传送下去？
Beam the high advisor down without warning, did he say?

573
00:37:58,211 --> 00:37:59,900
那不是他的原话，斯科特先生
That's not an exact quote, Mr. Scott.

574
00:37:59,937 --> 00:38:01,692
然而，意思没错
However, it does express the thought.

575
00:38:02,248 --> 00:38:04,344
我要看看顾问的表情
I'd like to see the advisor's face.

576
00:38:05,345 --> 00:38:06,481
你会有这个机会的
You will have that opportunity.

577
00:38:07,141 --> 00:38:08,997
舰长说了立刻，是吗？
The captain did say immediately, did he not?

578
00:38:09,835 --> 00:38:12,599
这是他的原话
Now, that is an exact quote,.

579
00:38:12,992 --> 00:38:15,354
斯科特先生，我建议你亲自操作传送装置
Mr. Scott,  I suggest you handle the transporter yourself.

580
00:38:15,378 --> 00:38:18,025
这可能非常微妙，对我们来说是传送问题
This could be very delicate as a problem in transporting for us

581
00:38:18,657 --> 00:38:19,952
对舰长来说是外交问题
and in diplomacy for the captain.

582
00:38:20,130 --> 00:38:20,730
是的
Aye.

583
00:38:30,491 --> 00:38:31,899
有什么烦心事吗，卓克辛？
Something's upsetting you, Droxine.

584
00:38:32,334 --> 00:38:33,207
没有，父亲
No, Father.

585
00:38:33,686 --> 00:38:34,654
怎么了？和我说说
What is it? Tell me.

586
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:36,510
真的没有，我没有不高兴
No, really. I'm not upset.

587
00:38:37,292 --> 00:38:39,907
我只是站在这里望着太空
I was just standing here looking into space

588
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:42,143
并想知道他是否会回来
and wondering whether or not he would return.

589
00:38:42,278 --> 00:38:43,967
他永远不会回来，我已经看到了
He will never return. I've seen to that.

590
00:38:44,603 --> 00:38:46,857
但是天顶石对他来说是如此重要
But the zenite is so important to him.

591
00:38:47,279 --> 00:38:48,252
他必须拿到它
He must have it.

592
00:38:48,439 --> 00:38:49,229
会交付的
It will be delivered.

593
00:38:49,234 --> 00:38:51,850
哪怕我们得杀了下面的每个特罗格莱特，也会交付
If we have to kill every Troglyte below, it will be delivered.

594
00:38:52,068 --> 00:38:54,035
到那时，可能为时已晚
By that time, it may be too late.

595
00:38:54,805 --> 00:38:56,428
或许他确实有办法…
Perhaps he does have a method.

596
00:38:56,582 --> 00:38:57,414
他什么都不懂
He knows nothing,

597
00:38:58,341 --> 00:39:00,642
除了如何摧毁我们的权力和我们的社会
except how to destroy our power and our society.

598
00:39:01,531 --> 00:39:05,530
我禁止你再说起柯克舰长，甚至是想到他
I forbid you ever to speak of Captain Kirk, or even to think of him.

599
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:07,384
[斯科特]]史波克先生的传送室
[SCOTT] Transporter room to Mr. Spock.

600
00:39:09,137 --> 00:39:09,713
史波克来了
Spock here.

601
00:39:09,988 --> 00:39:12,804
我已经锁定了云城议会画廊的坐标
I've locked into the coordinates of the cloud city council gallery.

602
00:39:13,028 --> 00:39:14,506
准备传送高级顾问
Ready to transport the high advisor.

603
00:39:14,984 --> 00:39:15,933
你得等一下啊
You'll have to delay.

604
00:39:16,438 --> 00:39:17,098
怎么了？
What's wrong?

605
00:39:18,029 --> 00:39:20,227
在画廊里探测到两个生命体
Picking up two life-forms in the gallery.

606
00:39:20,353 --> 00:39:22,673
他们靠得非常近
They are inseparably close to one another.

607
00:39:22,965 --> 00:39:26,677
我们无法只传送其中一个
We cannot transport one without the other.

608
00:39:26,836 --> 00:39:30,534
你是不是说了“立即”一词是舰长的命令的原话？
Did you say the word "immediately" was an exact quote of the captain's orders?

609
00:39:30,995 --> 00:39:32,083
的确如此，斯科特先生
Precisely, Mr. Scott.

610
00:39:32,805 --> 00:39:35,200
那我们要照做吗？
Are we going to do anything about it?

611
00:39:36,252 --> 00:39:39,484
等到高级顾问一个人或者能被分离前
Until the high advisor is alone or can be isolated,

612
00:39:39,788 --> 00:39:41,398
舰长得要等着了
the captain will have to wait.

613
00:39:42,034 --> 00:39:43,826
除非你有其他选择
Unless you have an alternative.

614
00:39:45,074 --> 00:39:46,674
我会再考虑一下
I'll give it further thought.

615
00:39:49,494 --> 00:39:51,651
我没有在想柯克舰长
I wasn't thinking of Captain Kirk.

616
00:39:52,909 --> 00:39:55,715
是那个有着精致形状的耳朵的人
It's the one with those exquisitely-shaped ears.

617
00:39:57,455 --> 00:39:58,807
他叫史波克
His name is Spock.

618
00:39:59,471 --> 00:40:01,199
他是我在想的人
He's the one I was thinking about.

619
00:40:02,297 --> 00:40:05,772
你知道他有令人难以置信的敏感听力吗？
Did you know that he has the most incredibly sensitive hearing?

620
00:40:06,343 --> 00:40:08,565
为什么，我几乎相信
Why, I almost believe that

621
00:40:09,112 --> 00:40:11,937
如果我站在这里呼唤他
if I stood here and called out to him,

622
00:40:12,742 --> 00:40:14,538
他能听到我的邀请
he would hear my invitation to come

623
00:40:14,538 --> 00:40:16,894
来和我们一起再参观一会儿
and visit with us for a little while longer.

624
00:40:17,185 --> 00:40:19,038
哦，他并不比他的朋友好
Oh, he's no better than his friend.

625
00:40:19,982 --> 00:40:20,814
我们试试？
Shall we try?

626
00:40:22,176 --> 00:40:22,766
怎么了？
What is it?

627
00:40:23,738 --> 00:40:25,315
破坏者万娜失踪了
The Disrupter Vanna has disappeared.

628
00:40:25,493 --> 00:40:27,074
她的警卫被发现昏迷不醒
Her guard was found unconscious.

629
00:40:27,579 --> 00:40:28,987
他被柯克舰长袭击了
He'd been attacked by Captain Kirk.

630
00:40:29,221 --> 00:40:30,240
柯克舰长在哪里？
Where is Captain Kirk?

631
00:40:30,498 --> 00:40:31,438
他不知道，长官
He did not know, sir.

632
00:40:31,789 --> 00:40:33,762
直到我去帮助他，他才恢复了神智
He did not regain his senses until I came to his aid.

633
00:40:34,473 --> 00:40:37,004
这就是他们用来说服我们的理由
This is the kind of reason they use to persuade us.

634
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:38,272
他们很绝望
They are desperate.

635
00:40:38,824 --> 00:40:40,744
我不想再听到为他们的辩护了
I will hear no more defense of them.

636
00:40:43,277 --> 00:40:46,029
我敢肯定史波克先生不会这么做
I'm sure Mr. Spock would not behave so.

637
00:40:46,916 --> 00:40:47,982
马上离开这里
Leave here at once.

638
00:40:48,656 --> 00:40:49,385
去听你的音乐
Go to your music.

639
00:40:54,114 --> 00:40:57,959
父亲，我们是否对自己的方法如此肯定
Father, are we so sure of our methods

640
00:40:58,001 --> 00:41:00,092
以至于我们从不质疑自己的所作所为？
that we never question what we do?

641
00:41:05,682 --> 00:41:06,834
史波克到传送室
Spock to transporter room.

642
00:41:07,001 --> 00:41:07,600
我是斯科特
Scott here.

643
00:41:07,703 --> 00:41:09,658
锁定议会画廊坐标
Lock in on council gallery coordinates.

644
00:41:09,798 --> 00:41:10,546
锁定，长官
Locked in, sir.

645
00:41:11,061 --> 00:41:11,739
传送
Energize.

646
00:41:12,067 --> 00:41:12,667
是的，长官
Aye, sir.

647
00:41:13,447 --> 00:41:14,176
传送中
Energizing.

648
00:41:20,117 --> 00:41:21,205
怎么样，斯科特先生？
How are you doing, Mr. Scott?

649
00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:22,540
很好，史波克先生
Fine, Mr. Spock.

650
00:41:22,811 --> 00:41:25,636
高级顾问正在平台上实体化
The high advisor's materializing on the platform.

651
00:41:26,197 --> 00:41:27,919
立刻把他传送给柯克舰长
Beam him down to Captain Kirk immediately.

652
00:41:28,232 --> 00:41:28,985
正在传送，长官
Energizing, sir.

653
00:41:30,375 --> 00:41:31,895
他正在去见舰长的路上
He's on his way to the captain.

654
00:41:33,239 --> 00:41:34,304
干得好，斯科特先生
Good work, Mr. Scott.

655
00:41:34,748 --> 00:41:36,334
顾问看起来相当生气
The advisor looked mighty angry.

656
00:41:36,736 --> 00:41:38,528
我希望他不会给舰长带去太多的麻烦
I hope he doesn't give the captain too much trouble.

657
00:41:39,023 --> 00:41:42,735
舰长会使用他惯用的外交手段
The captain will employ his usual diplomatic balm.

658
00:41:43,486 --> 00:41:46,354
绑架星球官员是一项严重的罪行
Abduction of a planet official is a serious crime.

659
00:41:46,858 --> 00:41:48,443
你会为此付出代价，我保证！
You will pay for this, I promise you!

660
00:41:48,851 --> 00:41:52,092
除非你确信天顶石气体的影响，顾问先生
Not until you're convinced of the effects of the zenite gas, Mr. Advisor.

661
00:41:52,382 --> 00:41:55,033
影响？我在这里已经快一个地球时了
Effects? I've been here nearly an hour of your Earth time,

662
00:41:55,284 --> 00:41:56,564
你和万娜甚至更久！
you and Vanna even longer!

663
00:41:56,793 --> 00:41:58,969
我看不出任何人有什么变化！
I see no changes in any of us!

664
00:42:02,214 --> 00:42:03,922
也许你需要更近距离的接触
Perhaps you need closer exposure.

665
00:42:04,965 --> 00:42:05,794
装满那个容器
Fill that container.

666
00:42:08,403 --> 00:42:10,899
你是要我挖天顶石吗？
Are you suggesting that I dig zenite?

667
00:42:11,658 --> 00:42:12,341
我坚持
I insist.

668
00:42:12,973 --> 00:42:15,148
你确实会为此付出代价
You will indeed pay for this.

669
00:42:23,567 --> 00:42:24,278
你也是，万娜
You, too, Vanna.

670
00:42:26,304 --> 00:42:27,904
你也是！挖！
You, too! Dig!

671
00:42:34,368 --> 00:42:35,444
[通讯器哔哔声]
[COMMUNICATOR BLEEPS]

672
00:42:38,409 --> 00:42:39,620
我是柯克，怎么了？
Kirk here. What is it?

673
00:42:40,028 --> 00:42:41,080
通信确认，舰长
Contact check, captain.

674
00:42:41,412 --> 00:42:43,522
距离上次与你通信已经超过一个小时了
It has been over an hour since your last communication.

675
00:42:43,667 --> 00:42:46,548
你们的命令是待命
Your orders are to stand by.

676
00:42:46,847 --> 00:42:48,063
现在，继续执行它们，通话完毕
Now, carry them out. Kirk out.

677
00:42:48,943 --> 00:42:50,075
待命中，舰长
Standing by, Captain.

678
00:42:50,304 --> 00:42:52,847
但是，让我提醒你，我们只剩五个小时来…
However, let me remind you, we have only five hours left to.

679
00:42:56,678 --> 00:42:58,499
这很不像舰长
It is very unlike the captain.

680
00:42:58,915 --> 00:43:00,464
会是天顶石在影响他吗？
Can the zenite be affecting him?

681
00:43:07,821 --> 00:43:08,911
我变得昏昏欲睡
I grow faint.

682
00:43:11,493 --> 00:43:12,773
氧气在消失
The oxygen is going.

683
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:17,199
她是对的，柯克，带我们离开这里
She's right. Kirk, transport us out of here.

684
00:43:17,775 --> 00:43:20,591
我们会在气体生效后离开
We'll leave when the gas has effect.

685
00:43:20,989 --> 00:43:22,485
它永远不会生效
It will never take effect.

686
00:43:22,570 --> 00:43:24,417
带我们离开这里！
Transport us out of here!

687
00:43:26,415 --> 00:43:26,971
挖！
Dig!

688
00:43:27,027 --> 00:43:29,011
傻瓜，我们会死的！
Imbecile. We'll die!

689
00:43:29,113 --> 00:43:30,545
我说挖！
I said dig!

690
00:43:35,026 --> 00:43:37,991
我是整个星球的高级顾问
I am high advisor of all the planet.

691
00:43:39,011 --> 00:43:41,074
我不会再听你的命令了！
I will take no more orders!

692
00:43:41,181 --> 00:43:42,253
再走一步，我就杀了你
One more step and I'll kill you.

693
00:43:43,010 --> 00:43:43,709
气体
The gas.

694
00:43:43,852 --> 00:43:44,783
舰长，你说得对
Captain, you were right.

695
00:43:45,209 --> 00:43:46,088
正在产生影响
It's taking effect.

696
00:43:46,645 --> 00:43:47,669
舰长，你说得对
Captain, you were right.

697
00:43:50,958 --> 00:43:54,218
你用凿和你用相位枪的时候一样勇敢吗？
Are you as brave with mortae as you are with a phaser?

698
00:43:54,545 --> 00:43:55,574
这两个都能杀人
Both will kill.

699
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:45,278
企业号！企业号，帮助！
Enterprise! Enterprise, help!

700
00:44:46,868 --> 00:44:47,820
企业号！
Enterprise!

701
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:49,908
企业号，我是史波克
Enterprise. Spock here.

702
00:44:50,292 --> 00:44:51,873
他们会互相残杀，帮帮我们
They'll kill each other. Help us.

703
00:44:52,546 --> 00:44:53,250
帮帮我们！
Help us!

704
00:44:57,187 --> 00:44:59,666
企业号！企业号！
Enterprise! Enterprise!

705
00:45:21,346 --> 00:45:24,073
天顶石气体影响了你，舰长！
The zenite gas has affected you. Captain!

706
00:45:26,473 --> 00:45:27,753
天顶石气体！
The zenite gas!

707
00:45:30,935 --> 00:45:31,767
天顶石气体
Zenite gas.

708
00:45:32,619 --> 00:45:33,381
小心，吉姆！
Look out, Jim!

709
00:45:34,060 --> 00:45:34,764
舰长！
Captain!

710
00:45:48,382 --> 00:45:49,086
呃…
Well.

711
00:45:51,175 --> 00:45:56,212
看来我的小示范…相当成功
it seems my little demonstration was. quite a success.

712
00:46:05,100 --> 00:46:08,492
我不喜欢过滤器，甚至不喜欢面具
I don't like filters, or even masks.

713
00:46:09,651 --> 00:46:14,459
我更喜欢“防护物”这个词，不是吗？
I like the word "protector" much better, don't you?

714
00:46:16,181 --> 00:46:19,509
它不那么专业，因此，不那么准确
It is less technical, therefore, less accurate,

715
00:46:20,821 --> 00:46:23,810
但也许对功能的描述更通俗
but perhaps more generally descriptive of the function.

716
00:46:24,390 --> 00:46:26,886
看来你终究得到了你想要的东西
It appears you have what you came for after all.

717
00:46:27,678 --> 00:46:30,559
舰长将得到他的天顶石，正如我所同意的那样
The captain will have his zenite just as I agreed.

718
00:46:30,835 --> 00:46:31,476
同意？
Agreed?

719
00:46:32,178 --> 00:46:34,451
特罗格莱特字典中没有这样的词
There's no such word in the Troglyte vocabulary.

720
00:46:34,629 --> 00:46:36,600
舰长会拿到他的天顶石
The captain will have his zenite.

721
00:46:36,907 --> 00:46:38,722
无需你的同意
No thanks to an agreement by you.

722
00:46:38,750 --> 00:46:40,101
它必须通过武力获得
It had to be obtained by force.

723
00:46:40,218 --> 00:46:43,071
因为这是我们能够获得应得的东西的唯一途径
Because it is the only way we can obtain what is due us.

724
00:46:43,507 --> 00:46:44,540
对你的教育呢？
How about your education?

725
00:46:44,587 --> 00:46:45,491
那也是强迫的吗？
Was that by force?

726
00:46:45,944 --> 00:46:48,410
它符合你当时的目的
It served your purpose at the time.

727
00:46:48,797 --> 00:46:51,505
你可以拥有这些过滤器，它们对你有好处
You could have had those filters for all the good it will do you.

728
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:52,876
他们会非常有效，长官
They will be very effective, sir.

729
00:46:53,278 --> 00:46:54,298
它们已经过严格的测试
They've been severely tested.

730
00:46:54,476 --> 00:46:58,887
特罗格莱特将不再遭受发育迟滞和情绪困难
And the Troglytes will no longer suffer from retardation and emotional difficulties.

731
00:46:59,153 --> 00:47:00,374
他们都会像她一样…
They will all be like her.

732
00:47:01,005 --> 00:47:02,624
忘恩负义，报复心强
ungrateful, vindictive.

733
00:47:02,951 --> 00:47:06,520
是的，我们的要求才刚刚开始
Yes. Our demands have just begun.

734
00:47:09,598 --> 00:47:11,141
这是天顶石，舰长
Here is the zenite, Captain.

735
00:47:13,167 --> 00:47:14,411
就像我承诺的那样
Just as I promised.

736
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:16,175
谢谢你，万娜
Thank you, Vanna.

737
00:47:17,115 --> 00:47:20,817
斯特拉托斯是如此令人愉快和美丽

738
00:47:22,297 --> 00:47:23,850
我想我害怕离开它
I think I'm afraid to leave it.

739
00:47:24,543 --> 00:47:27,999
下面的知识中存在着巨大的美
There is great beauty in the knowledge that lies below.

740
00:47:30,081 --> 00:47:32,798
只有一种方式能真正体验它
And only one way to really experience it.

741
00:47:33,860 --> 00:47:35,204
我会去矿井
I shall go to the mines.

742
00:47:38,266 --> 00:47:41,129
我希望不再被限制在云端
I no longer wish to be limited to the clouds.

743
00:47:43,070 --> 00:47:46,588
你的星球是这样的吗？
Is. your planet like this one?

744
00:47:47,271 --> 00:47:47,894
不
No.

745
00:47:50,292 --> 00:47:52,867
不，瓦肯完全不同
No, Vulcan is quite different.

746
00:47:55,597 --> 00:47:57,402
哪天我应该去看看
Some day I should like to visit it.

747
00:48:00,667 --> 00:48:04,140
也许某种形式的调解可以帮助你解决困难
Perhaps some form of mediation can be helpful in your difficulties.

748
00:48:04,952 --> 00:48:08,216
联邦工业化局可能对你有所帮助
The Federation Bureau of Industrialization may be of aid to you.

749
00:48:08,923 --> 00:48:11,291
我绝不允许任何干涉！
I will tolerate absolutely no interference!

750
00:48:11,650 --> 00:48:14,082
只要我统治，你就不能踏足这里！
You will not set foot here as long as I rule!

751
00:48:14,517 --> 00:48:18,096
相信我，长官，我既没有时间也没有渴望回到这里来
Believe me, sir, I have neither the time nor the desire to return here.

752
00:48:18,297 --> 00:48:21,086
要不是得回答你对我的指控才不会回来
Only answering your charges against me will force me back.

753
00:48:21,417 --> 00:48:22,441
我坚持这些指控
And I shall press them.

754
00:48:23,049 --> 00:48:24,794
你犯了绑架罪，舰长！
You are guilty of abduction, Captain!

755
00:48:24,869 --> 00:48:27,610
你犯了攻击星舰指挥官并谋害其生命的罪行！
You're guilty of attacking a starship commander and plotting against his life.

756
00:48:27,717 --> 00:48:30,987
舰长，也许这两件事最好都忘掉
Captain, perhaps both incidents are best forgotten.

757
00:48:37,110 --> 00:48:37,816
是的，万娜
Yes, Vanna.

758
00:48:41,792 --> 00:48:43,817
它们从未发生过，顾问先生
They never happened, Mr. Advisor.

759
00:48:49,982 --> 00:48:51,865
史波克先生，让我们去派送天顶石
Mr. Spock, let's get that zenite delivered.

760
00:48:51,886 --> 00:48:54,047
我相信我们只剩3个小时了
I believe we only have three hours left.

761
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:56,596
准确地说是2小时59分钟，舰长
Two hours, 59 minutes to be exact, Captain.

762
00:49:11,078 --> 00:49:11,887
柯克呼叫企业号
Kirk to Enterprise.

763
00:49:12,626 --> 00:49:13,382
柯克呼叫企业号
Kirk to Enterprise.

764
00:49:14,754 --> 00:49:17,314
