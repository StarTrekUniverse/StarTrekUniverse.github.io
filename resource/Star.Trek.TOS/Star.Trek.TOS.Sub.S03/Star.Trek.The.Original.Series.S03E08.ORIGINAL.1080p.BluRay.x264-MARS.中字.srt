7
00:00:47,402 --> 00:00:51,322
契科夫先生，确定导弹的发射点
Mr. Chekov, get a fix on the missile's point of origin.

00:00:51,489 --> 00:00:56,244

00:01:03,668 --> 00:01:08,089

- Warp factor 3, Mr. Sulu. - Yes, sir.

我首先是一名护士，麦考伊医生，然后是一名船员
I am a nurse first, Dr. McCoy, and a member of the crew second.

13
00:01:21,436 --> 00:01:23,604
你被解除职务了，去你的宿舍
You're excused. Go to your quarters.

14
00:01:23,771 --> 00:01:28,609
抱歉，我已经呼叫舰长了，我会等他来
I'm sorry. I've called the captain and I'll wait until he comes.

15
00:01:29,944 --> 00:01:34,282
- 有什么急事？  - 我说你被解除职务了，护士
- What's the emergency? - I said you were excused, Nurse.

16
00:01:34,449 --> 00:01:38,995
拜托，克里斯汀，我向你保证我会给舰长一份完整的报告
Please, Christine. I promise you I'll give the captain a full report.

17
00:01:48,046 --> 00:01:50,506
那场面真壮观
That was quite a scene.

18
00:01:50,673 --> 00:01:53,718
我已经完成了船员的身体检查
I've completed physical examinations for the crew.

19
00:01:53,926 --> 00:01:56,512
- 有什么紧急情况？  - 船员身体健康

20
00:01:56,804 --> 00:02:00,224
我没有发现任何异常，只有一个例外

26
00:02:20,078 --> 00:02:23,373

35
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:59,093
- 史波克先生  - 是的，舰长？
- Mr. Spock. - Yes, Captain?

36
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:02,263
确认导弹原点的坐标
Confirm coordinates for the missile's origin.

37
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:05,808
正确，我们正在接近这些坐标
Correct. We are approaching those coordinates.

40
00:04:14,859 --> 00:04:18,863
不会，舰长，我们一直在扫描这个区域
Negative, Captain. We've had that area on scanners constantly.

41
00:04:20,573 --> 00:04:23,784
那么小行星是导弹的原点吗？
Then the asteroid is the missile's point of origin?

42
00:04:23,951 --> 00:04:26,829
是的，舰长
Correct, Captain.

00:04:34,629 --> 00:04:39,383
典型的小行星化学组成，但它不绕轨道运行
Typical asteroid chemically, but it is not orbiting.

45
00:04:39,592 --> 00:04:43,804
它沿着一条穿过太阳系的独立路线
It is pursuing an independent course through this solar system.

46
00:04:43,971 --> 00:04:46,307
怎么会这样？
How could that be?

47
00:04:46,599 --> 00:04:52,063
除非它是…有动力的，一艘太空飞船？
Unless it's... powered. A spaceship?

48
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:56,234
它是有动力的，舰长
It is under power, Captain.

49
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,362
- 动力源？  - 核动力，非常古老

50

51
00:05:02,907 --> 00:05:05,868
契科夫先生，绘制小行星飞船的路线图

52
00:05:06,035 --> 00:05:09,997
小行星有一个外壳，是空心的
Asteroid has an outer shell, which is hollow.

53
00:05:10,998 --> 00:05:16,003
它包含着一个独立的内核，由可呼吸的大气
It surrounds an independent core, which has a breathable atmosphere.

54
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:21,384
- 传感器没有探测到生命形式  - 它一定处于自动控制状态
- Sensors read no life-forms. - It must be on automatic controls.

55
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:26,430
乘客或建造者死了
The passengers or builders are dead.

56
00:05:27,932 --> 00:05:34,188
小行星的航向，我是说，飞船的航向，241，标记17
Course of asteroid, I mean, spaceship, 241, mark 17.

57
00:05:34,522 --> 00:05:36,857
- 真有趣  - 是的
- Interesting. - Yes.

58
00:05:37,024 --> 00:05:43,864
那个航向将使小行星与达兰五号发生碰撞
That course would put the asteroid on a collision course with Daran V.

59
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:50,454
- 达兰五号？有人居住吗？  - 是的
- Daran V? Inhabited? - Correct.

60
00:05:50,663 --> 00:05:55,710
人口大约37.24亿，如果我没记错的话

苏鲁先生，调整<i>企业号</i>速度与小行星飞船相同
Mr. Sulu. Match <i>Enterprise</i> speed with that of the asteroid vessel.

63
00:06:07,471 --> 00:06:11,475
史波克先生和我要传送登船，斯科特先生，指挥操舵
Mr. Spock and I are transporting aboard. Mr. Scott, you have the conn.

64
00:06:18,482 --> 00:06:23,988
一年可以发生很多事情，请珍惜每一分钟
A lot can happen in a year. Please, give yourself every minute.

65
00:06:29,076 --> 00:06:32,413
麦考伊医生，史波克先生和我会处理这件事
Dr. McCoy, Mr. Spock and I will handle this.

66
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:36,417
不带上我，吉姆？你会连回来的路都找不到
Without me, Jim? You'd never find your way back.

67
00:06:36,584 --> 00:06:38,669
呃…
Well...

68
00:06:38,836 --> 00:06:44,508
- 我认为更明智的做法是…  - 我想去，我很好，舰长
- I think it would be wiser if... - I'd like to go. I'm fine, Captain.

69
00:06:45,718 --> 00:06:49,847
好的，医生，如果那是你想要的
All right, Doctor. If that's what you want.

70
00:07:11,243 --> 00:07:14,038
麦考伊：我发誓我在一颗行星上
McCOY: You'd swear you were on a planet.

71
00:07:14,205 --> 00:07:17,792
史波克：造一艘看起来像行星的船的逻辑是什么？
SPOCK: What is the logic in making a ship look like a planet?

72
00:07:17,958 --> 00:07:21,337
真看不出这是艘太空飞船，柯克呼叫<i>企业号</i>
Wouldn't know this was a spaceship. Kirk to <i>Enterprise</i>.

73
00:07:21,504 --> 00:07:26,050
- 企业号，<i>我是斯科特</i>  - 安全到达，完毕
- Enterprise, <i>Scott here.</i> - Transported without incident. Out.

74
00:07:50,366 --> 00:07:53,411
没有可见的入口
No apparent opening.

75
00:07:53,577 --> 00:07:57,415
你没有发现智能生命形式，但肯定…
You've found no intelligent life-forms, but surely...

76
00:07:57,581 --> 00:08:00,543
这艘船已经有10,000多年的历史了，医生
The ship is over 10,000 years old, Doctor.

77
00:08:00,709 --> 00:08:04,088
仍然没有生命形式的迹象，舰长
Still no sign of life-forms, Captain.

78
00:08:51,886 --> 00:08:54,763
这些是武器？
These are weapons?

79
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:59,226
算是一种，武器，通讯设备
Of a sort. Weapons, communication devices.

80
00:08:59,393 --> 00:09:01,645
让我去找我的朋友
Let me go to my friend.

81
00:09:12,948 --> 00:09:16,660
- 你没事吧？  - 我没事
- You all right? - I think so.

82
00:09:19,163 --> 00:09:23,959
我是纳提拉，人民的高级女祭司
I am Natira, the high priestess of the people.

83
00:09:24,126 --> 00:09:27,087
欢迎来到尤纳达的世界
Welcome to the world of Yonada.

84
00:09:27,254 --> 00:09:30,633
我得说这可不算什么欢迎
I can't say I think much of your welcome.

85
00:09:30,799 --> 00:09:32,843
带他们走
Take them.

86
00:10:37,324 --> 00:10:39,493
你们要跪下
You will kneel.

87
00:10:56,343 --> 00:11:01,348
她称这个为“世界”，这些人不知道他们在船上
She called this "the world". These people don't know they're on a ship.

88
00:11:01,515 --> 00:11:06,770
它们已经飞行了10,000年，也许他们没有意识到
They've been in flight 10,000 years. Maybe they don't realize it.

89
00:11:09,773 --> 00:11:15,404
哦，人民的神谕，最完美和最明智的
Oh, Oracle of the people, most perfect and wise.

90
00:11:15,571 --> 00:11:18,866
陌生人来到了我们的世界
Strangers have come to our world.

91
00:11:19,033 --> 00:11:22,119
他们带着我们不懂的器械
They bear instruments we do not understand.

92
00:11:37,134 --> 00:11:40,262
你是谁？
Who are you?

93
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:46,977
我是星舰<i>企业号</i>的柯克舰长
I am Captain Kirk of the starship <i>Enterprise.</i>

94
00:11:47,144 --> 00:11:52,149
这是我的医疗官，麦考伊医生，我的大副，史波克先生
This is my medical officer, Dr. McCoy. My first officer, Mr. Spock.

95
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:58,656
- 你为什么要来到这个世界？  - 我们是出于友谊而来的
- Why do you visit this world? - We've come in friendship.

96
00:11:58,822 --> 00:12:00,074

97
00:12:00,324 --> 00:12:02,451
神谕：<i>了解成为我们的敌人意味着什么</i>
ORACLE: <i>Learn what it means to be our enemy</i>

98
00:12:02,618 --> 00:12:06,121
<i>在你了解成为我们的朋友意味着什么之前</i>
<i>before you learn what it means to be our friend.</i>

99
00:12:24,264 --> 00:12:27,184
史波克
Spock.

100
00:12:28,352 --> 00:12:32,022
麦考伊医生，老骨头
Dr. McCoy. Bones.

101
00:12:33,023 --> 00:12:35,150
老骨头？
Bones?

102
00:12:35,317 --> 00:12:38,362
医生一定是受到了过度的电击
The doctor must have received an excessive shock.

103
00:12:38,529 --> 00:12:40,489
不，不是这样
No, that's not it.

104
00:12:40,656 --> 00:12:43,450
没有其他原因可以造成这种情况，舰长
Nothing else could have caused this, Captain.

105
00:12:43,617 --> 00:12:46,203
至少，这里没有发生过什么
At least, nothing that has happened here.

106
00:12:47,204 --> 00:12:51,834
你说得对，由于麦考伊的虚弱状况，电击很严重
You're right. The shock was serious due to McCoy's weakened condition.

107
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,171
请问医生究竟有什么问题？
May I ask precisely what is troubling the doctor?

108
00:12:59,633 --> 00:13:05,806
我认为他不会告诉你，但我认为你现在应该知道了
I don't think he would have told you, but I think you should know now.

109
00:13:05,973 --> 00:13:09,518
是异种红细胞增多症
It's xenopolycythemia.

110
00:13:10,602 --> 00:13:15,149
好吧，我知道这个，舰长
Yes. I know of it, Captain.

111
00:13:15,315 --> 00:13:18,610
那你就知道它是绝症
Then you know that nothing can be done.

112
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:29,580
老骨头，怎么样？
Bones, how is it?

113
00:13:30,998 --> 00:13:33,917
我很好
I'm all right.

114
00:13:34,084 --> 00:13:37,546
- 你还好吗，史波克先生？  - 很好，医生
- Are you all right, Mr. Spock? - Very well, Doctor.

115
00:13:37,713 --> 00:13:41,091
舰长和我似乎没有受到任何不良影响
The captain and I seem to have suffered no ill effects.

116
00:13:41,258 --> 00:13:43,886
那个“神谕”真的吓到我了
That "Oracle" really got to me.

117
00:13:44,052 --> 00:13:48,348
我一定对它的魔咒特别敏感
I must be especially susceptible to its magic spells.

118
00:13:54,438 --> 00:13:56,565
史波克知道了
Spock knows.

119
00:14:02,112 --> 00:14:05,949
好吧，我们最好去控制室
Well, we better get to the control room.

120
00:14:07,451 --> 00:14:11,538
- 你可以起来吗？  - 别担心，我能做到，吉姆
- Are you in any condition to get up? - Don't worry, I can make it, Jim.

121
00:14:11,705 --> 00:14:14,875
告知这些人他们在船上
Informing these people they're on a ship

122
00:14:15,167 --> 00:14:18,420
可能违反星际舰队的最高指令
may violate Starfleet's Prime Directive.

123
00:14:18,587 --> 00:14:21,799
不，尤纳达的人民可能会因知识而改变
No, the people of Yonada may be changed by the knowledge,

124
00:14:21,965 --> 00:14:24,593
但总比消灭它们好
but it's better than exterminating them.

125
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:28,138
- 合乎逻辑，舰长  - 还有达兰五号上的30亿人
- Logical, Captain. - And the three billion on Daran V.

126
00:14:28,305 --> 00:14:30,307
也是合乎逻辑的，舰长
Also logical, Captain.

127
00:14:30,474 --> 00:14:34,144
先生们，我想我们有个客人
Gentlemen, I believe we have a visitor.

128
00:14:52,913 --> 00:14:54,498
能增强力量
For strength.

129
00:14:54,832 --> 00:14:58,335
我们中的许多人都感受到了我们神谕的力量
Many of us have felt the power of our oracle.

130
00:14:58,502 --> 00:15:01,338
这很有用
This has been of benefit.

131
00:15:02,589 --> 00:15:05,509
尝起来像一种古代的草药制品
Tastes like an ancient herb derivative.

132
00:15:11,682 --> 00:15:16,812
- 你不是尤纳达人  - 不，我们来自你的世界之外
- You are not of Yonada. - No, we're from outside your world.

133
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:20,607
哪里…是外面？
Where... is outside?

134
00:15:22,943 --> 00:15:25,028
上面
Up there.

135
00:15:25,195 --> 00:15:27,239
外面，上面，到处
Outside, up there, everywhere.

136
00:15:30,868 --> 00:15:33,537
他们也这么说
So they say, also.

137
00:15:38,208 --> 00:15:41,211
很多年前
Many years ago,

138
00:15:41,378 --> 00:15:46,884
我爬上了山，尽管这是被禁止的
I climbed the mountains, even though it is forbidden.

139
00:15:50,387 --> 00:15:52,681
为什么被禁止？
Why is it forbidden?

140
00:15:52,848 --> 00:15:54,892
我不知道
I am not sure.

141
00:15:58,061 --> 00:16:01,648
但事情并非…
But things are not...

142
00:16:01,815 --> 00:16:04,693
他们教我们的那样
as they teach us.

143
00:16:06,069 --> 00:16:09,239
因为世界是空心的
For the world is hollow,

144
00:16:09,406 --> 00:16:13,702
而我触碰到了天空
and I have touched the sky.

145
00:16:19,499 --> 00:16:23,754
- 这是什么，老骨头？  - 皮肤下有东西
- What is it, Bones? - There's something under the skin.

146
00:16:29,176 --> 00:16:31,803
他死了
He's dead.

147
00:16:32,888 --> 00:16:36,892
“因为世界是空心的，而我触碰到了天空”
"For the world is hollow and I have touched the sky."

148
00:16:37,059 --> 00:16:40,687
- 禁止爬山  - 当然
- It's forbidden to climb the mountains. - Of course.

149
00:16:40,854 --> 00:16:44,858
因为如果你这样做了，你会发现你生活在一个大球上
Because if you did, you'd find out you were living on a big ball.

150
00:16:45,025 --> 00:16:50,447
不是一颗行星而是一艘宇宙飞船，而这种知识似乎是被禁止的
Not a planet but a spaceship. And that knowledge seems to be forbidden.

151
00:16:51,907 --> 00:16:53,116
发生了什么？
What happened?

152
00:16:53,283 --> 00:16:56,203
我们不知道，他痛苦地尖叫着死去了
We don't know. He screamed in pain and died.

153
00:16:56,370 --> 00:16:58,956
叫守卫来
Fetch the guard.

154
00:17:03,085 --> 00:17:05,921
原谅他，因为他是个老人
Forgive him, for he was an old man.

155
00:17:06,213 --> 00:17:08,966
而老人有时是愚蠢的
And old men are sometimes foolish.

156
00:17:09,299 --> 00:17:15,097
但书上说，那些犯罪或说坏话的人
But it is written that those of the people who sin or speak evil

157
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:18,308
将受到惩罚
shall be punished.

158
00:17:25,607 --> 00:17:28,485
多年来他认真工作
He served well for many years.

159
00:17:28,652 --> 00:17:31,488
把他带走，轻轻地
Take him away, gently.

160
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,420
你看起来不太好，这让我很难受
You do not seem well. It is distressing to me.

161
00:17:46,586 --> 00:17:49,131
我很好，谢谢
I'm quite all right, thank you.

162
00:17:50,465 --> 00:17:55,846
您现在被视为贵宾，这是神谕的意愿
It is the will of the Oracle that you now be treated as honored guests.

163
00:18:00,892 --> 00:18:03,020
你似乎受到特别的喜爱
You seem to be the special favorite.

164
00:18:03,186 --> 00:18:06,606
这位年轻女士确实很喜欢你的陪伴
The young lady did show a preference for your company.

165
00:18:06,773 --> 00:18:11,445
- 没有人可以为此责怪她  - 我觉得她的品味值得怀疑
- Nobody can blame her for that. - I find her taste questionable.

166
00:18:11,611 --> 00:18:16,783
但她显然更喜欢你，而你似乎并不介意
But she obviously prefers you and you obviously don't seem to mind.

167
00:18:17,034 --> 00:18:21,329
如果你能安排和那位小姐单独相处
If you could arrange to be alone with the young lady,

168
00:18:21,496 --> 00:18:26,043
史波克和我可以找到这个…世界的能量控制器
Spock and I could find the power controls of this... world.

169
00:18:29,004 --> 00:18:32,174
是时候让自己焕然一新了
It is time to refresh yourselves.

170
00:18:36,928 --> 00:18:38,722
谢谢你，史波克先生
Thank you, Mr. Spock.

171
00:18:42,225 --> 00:18:45,520
敬我们尤纳达的好朋友
To our good friends of Yonada.

172
00:18:47,564 --> 00:18:51,651
- 我们对你们的世界很感兴趣  - 这让我们高兴
- We are very interested in your world. - That pleases us.

173
00:18:51,818 --> 00:18:53,737
你介意我们到处看看吗？
You mind if we looked around?

174
00:18:53,945 --> 00:18:56,740
一点也不，人民现在认识你们了
Not at all. The people know of you now.

175
00:18:56,948 --> 00:18:58,450
[咳嗽]
[COUGHS]

176
00:18:58,742 --> 00:19:01,578
你可以走动吗？
Are you well enough to go about?

177
00:19:03,246 --> 00:19:05,207
也许不行
Perhaps not.

178
00:19:05,373 --> 00:19:10,712
那为什么不留在这里呢？休息一下，我们聊聊天
Then why not remain here? Rest, we will talk.

179
00:19:10,879 --> 00:19:13,548
你真体贴
You are very kind.

180
00:19:14,591 --> 00:19:17,094
你们可以自由地四处走动并见见我们的人民
You are free to go about and meet our people.

181
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:19,221
谢谢
Thank you.

182
00:19:19,387 --> 00:19:22,891
感谢你照顾麦考伊医生
And thank you for taking care of Dr. McCoy.

183
00:19:23,058 --> 00:19:26,186
不用谢，我们会让他好起来的
Not at all. We shall make him well.

184
00:19:31,441 --> 00:19:32,776
史波克先生
Mr. Spock.

185
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:41,576
不，谢谢
No, thank you.

186
00:19:45,455 --> 00:19:47,415
请离开吧
Leave us.

187
00:19:50,127 --> 00:19:55,215
我很好奇，神谕是如何惩罚那位老人的？
I'm curious. How did the Oracle punish the old man?

188
00:19:56,216 --> 00:19:57,634
我…
I...

189
00:19:58,426 --> 00:20:00,303
…现在不能告诉你
...cannot tell you now.

190
00:20:01,429 --> 00:20:05,142
神谕有办法知道你说了什么，不是吗？
There is some way the Oracle knows what you say, isn't there?

191
00:20:06,143 --> 00:20:08,895
我们说的，我们想的
What we say, what we think.

192
00:20:09,062 --> 00:20:13,984
神谕知道所有人的想法和内心
The Oracle knows the minds and the hearts of all the people.

193
00:20:17,529 --> 00:20:21,408
我不知道你会受到如此严重的伤害
I did not know you would be hurt so badly.

194
00:20:21,575 --> 00:20:24,411
没关系
It's all right.

195
00:20:24,578 --> 00:20:27,414
我想我们必须学习神谕的力量
I suppose we had to learn the power of the Oracle.

196
00:20:27,581 --> 00:20:32,669
有件事我必须说，自从我…
There is something I must say. Since the moment I...

197
00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:45,140
隐藏自己的感情不符合人民的方式
It is not in the manner of the people to hide their feelings.

198
00:20:47,601 --> 00:20:52,063
诚实是…通常是明智的
Honesty is... usually wise.

199
00:20:52,355 --> 00:20:55,108
你有女人吗？
Is there a woman for you?

200
00:21:00,363 --> 00:21:02,365
不，没有
No, there isn't.

201
00:21:03,533 --> 00:21:07,120
麦考伊觉得我有吸引力吗？
Does McCoy find me attractive?

202
00:21:07,287 --> 00:21:10,373
哦，是的，是的，你有
Oh, yes. Yes, I do.

203
00:21:14,294 --> 00:21:17,047
我希望你们来自太空的
I hope you men of space,

204
00:21:17,214 --> 00:21:19,716
来自其他世界的人
of other worlds,

205
00:21:19,883 --> 00:21:23,678
像我们一样珍视真理
hold truth as dear as we do.

206
00:21:23,845 --> 00:21:26,014
我们的确是
We do.

207
00:21:28,475 --> 00:21:32,020
我希望你留在这里，在尤纳达
I wish you to stay here, on Yonada,

208
00:21:33,146 --> 00:21:35,607
作为我的伴侣
as my mate.

209
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:55,418
但我们彼此还是陌生人
But we're strangers to each other.

210
00:21:55,585 --> 00:21:59,256
但这不正是人的天性吗？
But is not that the nature of men and women?

211
00:21:59,422 --> 00:22:03,927
乐趣不就是互相了解的过程吗？
That the pleasure is in the learning of each other?

212
00:22:04,135 --> 00:22:05,929
是的
Yes.

213
00:22:07,555 --> 00:22:10,058
让思想在你心中安息
Let the thought rest in your heart.

214
00:22:16,147 --> 00:22:20,277
这些人不知道他们生活在宇宙飞船上
These people have no idea they're living on a spaceship.

215
00:22:20,443 --> 00:22:23,571
多少代人度过了他们的一生
How many generations have lived out their lives,

216
00:22:23,738 --> 00:22:26,283
并被埋葬在这里
and been buried here,

217
00:22:26,449 --> 00:22:29,744
但不知道他们的世界其实是空心的？
without ever knowing their world is hollow?

218
00:22:29,911 --> 00:22:33,039
人民，在充实的时间里，
The people, in the fullness of time,

219
00:22:33,206 --> 00:22:35,583
将到达一个新的世界
will reach a new world.

220
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:39,212
富饶，充满生机，赏心悦目
Rich, green, lovely to the eyes,

221
00:22:39,379 --> 00:22:40,964
以及善良
and of a goodness

222
00:22:41,131 --> 00:22:45,468
将使人们的心中充满喜悦的泪水。
that will fill the hearts of the people with tears of joy.

223
00:22:47,262 --> 00:22:50,307
你我一起分享那个世界
You can share that world with me,

224
00:22:50,473 --> 00:22:52,976
一起统治它
rule it by my side.

225
00:22:55,061 --> 00:22:59,149
你需要多久才能到达这个新世界？
How long will it take you to reach this new world?

226
00:23:00,442 --> 00:23:04,195
很快，神谕只会说“很快”
Soon. The Oracle will only say "soon".

227
00:23:06,489 --> 00:23:11,453
要是你知道我多么需要某种未来就好了，纳提拉
If you only knew how I needed some kind of future, Natira.

228
00:23:11,619 --> 00:23:13,997
你过着孤独的生活吗？
You have lived a lonely life?

229
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:18,710
是的，很孤独
Yes, very lonely.

230
00:23:21,504 --> 00:23:23,840
不会了，麦考伊
No more, McCoy.

231
00:23:26,009 --> 00:23:29,137
你将不再孤独
There will be no more loneliness for you.

232
00:23:31,222 --> 00:23:34,809
- 有件事我需要告诉你  - 不要说
- There's something I need to tell you. - There's not.

233
00:23:35,101 --> 00:23:37,854
- 但必须说  - 那就告诉我吧
- But there is. - Then tell me.

234
00:23:38,188 --> 00:23:40,357
如果你真的要说
If the telling is such a need.

235
00:23:41,524 --> 00:23:45,153
我得了一种绝症
I have an illness for which there is no cure.

236
00:23:48,656 --> 00:23:51,326
我还有一年的寿命
I have one year to live.

237
00:23:55,538 --> 00:23:58,541
遇见你之前，我的心是一片空白
Until I saw you, there was nothing in my heart.

238
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:03,338
它维持着我的生命，但仅此而已
It sustained my life, but nothing more.

239
00:24:03,505 --> 00:24:06,049
现在它会唱歌
Now it sings.

240
00:24:07,050 --> 00:24:11,054
我很高兴有这种感觉，哪怕一天
I could be happy to have that feeling for a day

241
00:24:11,221 --> 00:24:14,391
一个星期，一个月…
a week, a month...

242
00:24:14,724 --> 00:24:17,394
…一年
...a year.

243
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:20,522
无论创造者为我们安排了什么
Whatever the creators hold in store for us.

244
00:24:45,088 --> 00:24:48,383
舰长，神谕室
Captain, the Oracle room.

245
00:24:54,597 --> 00:24:57,934
问题：进入
The problem: to get in.

246
00:24:58,101 --> 00:25:00,061
我相信我可以…
I believe that I can...

247
00:25:05,942 --> 00:25:09,070
这些字绝对是法布里尼语，我认得
The writing is definitely Fabrini. I recognize it.

248
00:25:09,237 --> 00:25:12,574
法布里尼的太阳不是变成了新星并摧毁了它的行星吗？
Didn't the Fabrini sun go nova and destroy its planets?

249
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:16,244
到最后，法布里尼人住在地下
Towards the end, the Fabrini people lived underground

250
00:25:16,411 --> 00:25:18,371
来保护自己
to protect themselves.

251
00:25:18,538 --> 00:25:23,126
他们中的一些人肯定已经被安置在这艘船上
Some of them must have been put aboard this ship.

252
00:25:23,293 --> 00:25:27,338
而这些都是他们的后代
And these are their descendants.

253
00:25:29,841 --> 00:25:31,134
现在
Now.

254
00:25:52,822 --> 00:25:56,493
神谕似乎不知道我们在这里
The Oracle doesn't seem to know we're here.

255
00:25:59,078 --> 00:26:03,082
- 我想知道第一次是什么提醒了它  - 舰长…
- I wonder what alerted it the first time. - Captain...

256
00:26:03,249 --> 00:26:09,672
当纳提拉跪在那里时，神谕不友好的行为就开始了
The Oracle's reprehensible conduct was initiated when Natira knelt there.

257
00:26:09,881 --> 00:26:13,635
我觉得你是对的，继续调查
I think you're right. Continue investigating.

258
00:26:13,801 --> 00:26:19,933
控制器位置的线索一定在附近
The clue to the location of the control room must be around somewhere.

259
00:26:28,525 --> 00:26:32,487
这里没有任何迹象表明这绝不是一颗行星
Nothing here would indicate that this is anything but a planet.

260
00:26:38,701 --> 00:26:43,540
毫无疑问，但创造者会被认为是神
There's no question but the creators would have been considered gods.

261
00:26:49,796 --> 00:26:53,383
这代表一颗恒星及其太阳系
This is a representation of a star and its solar system.

262
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:57,512
八颗，法布里尼太阳系中行星的数量
Eight planets, the number in the Fabrina solar system.

263
00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:00,557
这些人是法布里尼人的后裔
These people are descendants of the Fabrini.

264
00:27:00,723 --> 00:27:05,061
他们已经在这艘小行星船上生活了10,000年
They've been on this asteroid ship for 10,000 years.

265
00:27:05,228 --> 00:27:07,021
[门打开]
[DOOR OPENS]

266
00:27:20,577 --> 00:27:21,744
神谕：<i>说吧</i>
ORACLE: <i>Speak.</i>

267
00:27:23,913 --> 00:27:27,375
- 是我，纳提拉  - <i>是的，纳提拉</i>
- It is I, Natira. - <i>Yes, Natira.</i>

268
00:27:28,585 --> 00:27:33,256
书上说只有人民的最高女祭司可以选择她的伴侣
It is written that only the high priestess of the people may select her mate.

269
00:27:33,464 --> 00:27:36,092
<i>是这么写的</i>
<i>It is so written.</i>

270
00:27:37,719 --> 00:27:40,930
我们中间的陌生人，三个访客
The strangers among us, the three visitors,

271
00:27:41,222 --> 00:27:44,058
有一个叫麦考伊
there is one called McCoy.

272
00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:47,520
我希望他留在这里
I wish him to remain here,

273
00:27:47,687 --> 00:27:50,231
作为我的伴侣
as my mate.

274
00:27:50,523 --> 00:27:52,692
<i>他同意吗？</i>
<i>Does he agree to this?</i>

275
00:27:52,859 --> 00:27:56,404
我已经问过他了，他还没有给我他的答案
I have asked him. He has not yet given me his answer.

276
00:27:56,571 --> 00:28:00,950
<i>他必须成为人民中的一员，敬奉创造者</i>
<i>He must become one of the people, worship the creators,</i>

277
00:28:01,117 --> 00:28:04,287
<i>并同意植入服从器</i>
<i>and agree to have the Instrument of Obedience.</i>

278
00:28:04,454 --> 00:28:06,623
他会被告知必须做什么
He will be told what must be done.

279
00:28:06,789 --> 00:28:09,959
<i>如果他同意所有的事情，那就可以</i>
<i>If he agrees to all things, it is permitted.</i>

280
00:28:10,126 --> 00:28:14,213
<i>仔细教他我们的法律，这样他就不会亵渎</i>
<i>Teach him our laws carefully so he commits no sacrilege,</i>

281
00:28:14,505 --> 00:28:18,885
<i>冒犯人民或创造者</i>
<i>no offense against the people or the creators.</i>

282
00:28:19,052 --> 00:28:23,973
我会的，哦，至高智慧
It will be done, oh, most wise.

283
00:28:40,948 --> 00:28:44,827
- <i>入侵者是谁？</i>  - 两个陌生人，柯克和史波克
- <i>Who are the intruders?</i> - Two strangers, Kirk and Spock.

284
00:28:44,994 --> 00:28:47,121
- <i>麦考伊没有和他们在一起？</i>  - 没有
- <i>McCoy is not with them?</i> - No.

285
00:28:47,288 --> 00:28:49,499
<i>他们犯了亵渎罪</i>
<i>They have committed sacrilege.</i>

286
00:28:49,666 --> 00:28:52,251
- <i>你知道必须做什么</i>  - 我知道
- <i>You know what must be done.</i> - I know.

287
00:28:55,254 --> 00:28:58,549
当神谕释放他们时，带他们走
When the Oracle releases them, take them.

288
00:28:59,342 --> 00:29:01,928
蠢人，你以为我们是孩童？
Fools. You think we are children?

289
00:29:02,095 --> 00:29:03,513
你认为你可以随心所欲
You think you can do as you please,

290
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:07,016
犯下任何让你开心的罪行？
commit whatever offense amuses you?

291
00:29:22,990 --> 00:29:25,201
你要对我的朋友们做什么？
What are you going to do to my friends?

292
00:29:25,368 --> 00:29:27,870
他们闯入了神谕室
They entered the Oracle room.

293
00:29:28,871 --> 00:29:32,166
- 惩罚是死亡？  - 是的
- And the punishment is death? - Yes.

294
00:29:32,333 --> 00:29:37,463
我不能做其他决定，我们相信他们，他们背叛了我们
I can make no other decision. We gave them our trust, they betrayed us.

295
00:29:37,630 --> 00:29:42,385
- 他们是出于无知，纳提拉  - 他们说他们是出于友谊而来的
- They acted out of ignorance, Natira. - They said they came in friendship.

296
00:29:42,552 --> 00:29:46,139
- 请让他们回到船上  - 我不能
- Please, let them return to the ship. - I cannot.

297
00:29:48,558 --> 00:29:50,893
为了我？
For me?

298
00:29:54,897 --> 00:29:56,899
我已经做出了决定
I've made my decision.

299
00:29:57,066 --> 00:30:00,194
我会留在这，留在尤纳达
I'm staying here, on Yonada.

300
00:30:05,241 --> 00:30:07,368
纳提拉
Natira.

301
00:30:07,535 --> 00:30:10,538
无论他们做了什么，都是因为他们觉得他们必须做
They did what they did because they felt they had to.

302
00:30:10,705 --> 00:30:14,917
请让他们回到船上，你不会后悔的
Please, let them return to the ship. You won't regret it.

303
00:30:15,084 --> 00:30:19,922
你认为如果我为了幸福留下来，但我的朋友死了
How do you think I'd I feel if I stayed, with a chance to be happy,

304
00:30:20,131 --> 00:30:23,176
我会有什么感觉？
but knowing my friends had died?

305
00:30:24,135 --> 00:30:25,762
是的
Yes.

306
00:30:29,432 --> 00:30:33,060
就这样吧，我将为麦考伊做这件事
So be it. This I will do for McCoy.

307
00:30:35,688 --> 00:30:39,776
为了我们的幸福和未来
For our happiness and future.

308
00:30:58,461 --> 00:31:00,254
你和我们一起回去？
You're returning with us?

309
00:31:00,546 --> 00:31:02,298
不，我不回去
No, I'm not.

310
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:08,221
这不是一颗行星，而是一艘宇宙飞船，在与达兰五号发生碰撞的航向上
This isn't a planet, it's a spaceship, on a collision course with Daran V.

311
00:31:08,387 --> 00:31:11,098
我自己也在毁灭的路上了
I'm on a kind of collision course myself.

312
00:31:11,265 --> 00:31:13,809
我命令你和我们一起回去
I order you to return with us.

313
00:31:14,143 --> 00:31:17,438
我拒绝
And I refuse.

314
00:31:19,315 --> 00:31:25,821
如果我们不能校正这艘船的航向，我们就必须把它炸出太空
If we can't correct the course of this ship, we'll have to blast it out of space.

315
00:31:25,988 --> 00:31:30,284
我打算和这些人呆在这艘船上，不管发生什么
I intend to stay on this ship with these people, whatever happens.

316
00:31:30,451 --> 00:31:33,621
你的决定是不合逻辑的，医生
Your decision is most illogical, Doctor.

317
00:31:34,997 --> 00:31:37,083
是吗，史波克先生？
Is it, Mr. Spock?

318
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:39,835
这是真的？
Is it really?

319
00:31:40,127 --> 00:31:42,255
我和纳提拉在一起
I'm staying with Natira.

320
00:31:42,421 --> 00:31:45,716
- 作为她的丈夫？  - 是的
- As her husband? - Yes.

321
00:31:48,803 --> 00:31:52,223
吉姆，这样问是不是太过分了？
Is that too much to ask, Jim?

322
00:31:53,182 --> 00:31:55,768
- 柯克呼叫<i>企业号</i>  - <i>我是斯科特</i>
- Kirk to Enterprise. - <i>Scott here.</i>

323
00:31:55,935 --> 00:31:59,855
我们要传送过去，锁定我们的信号
We're beaming over. Lock in on our signal.

324
00:32:00,022 --> 00:32:02,692
传送史波克先生和我
Transport Mr. Spock and myself.

325
00:32:02,858 --> 00:32:06,279
<i>麦考伊医生呢？</i>
<i>What about Dr. McCoy?</i>

326
00:32:18,249 --> 00:32:21,127
他要留下来，斯科提，通话完毕
He's staying, Scotty. Kirk out.

327
00:32:36,142 --> 00:32:38,269
神谕：<i>成为尤纳达人民的一员</i>
ORACLE: <i>To be one of the people of Yonada,</i>

328
00:32:38,561 --> 00:32:43,190
<i>服从器必须成为你肉体的一部分</i>
<i>the Instrument of Obedience must be made part of your flesh.</i>

329
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:47,069
<i>你现在同意吗？</i>
<i>Do you now give your consent?</i>

330
00:32:48,195 --> 00:32:51,324
- 我同意  - <i>开始</i>
- I do. - <i>Proceed.</i>

331
00:32:58,706 --> 00:33:03,919
有异议现在说，因为一旦完成，就不可改变
Say now. Because once done, it is done.

332
00:33:04,086 --> 00:33:06,922
没有异议
Let it be done.

333
00:33:13,596 --> 00:33:17,767
现在你成为我们中的一员了
You are now one with my people.

334
00:33:26,108 --> 00:33:28,944
愿我给你你想要的爱
May I give you the love you want,

335
00:33:29,111 --> 00:33:32,114
让你拥有美好的时光
and make the time you have beautiful.

336
00:33:33,449 --> 00:33:38,245
- 我们现在有同样的思想  - 同一颗心
- We are now of one mind. - One heart.

337
00:33:38,412 --> 00:33:41,207
同一个生命
One life.

338
00:33:53,803 --> 00:33:58,057
完成了，哦，至高智慧
It is done, oh, most wise.

339
00:33:58,224 --> 00:34:01,102
我们的生活与创造者相连
Our living link with the creators.

340
00:34:01,268 --> 00:34:05,773
<i>那么，教他作为人民必须知道的东西</i>
<i>Teach him, then, what he must know as one of the people.</i>

341
00:34:29,505 --> 00:34:32,174
这是人民之书
This is the Book of the People,

342
00:34:32,383 --> 00:34:35,845
当我们到达诺言的新世界时才能阅读
to be read when we reach the new world of the promise.

343
00:34:36,011 --> 00:34:38,848
这是创造者给予的
It was given by the creators.

344
00:34:39,014 --> 00:34:41,308
人民知道它的内容吗？
Do the people know its contents?

345
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:43,644
只知道这里是我们的世界
Only that it tells of our world here

346
00:34:43,811 --> 00:34:48,274
以及为什么我们必须尽快离开它到新世界
and why soon we must leave it for the new world.

347
00:34:48,441 --> 00:34:52,653
人民必须离开这里的原因告诉你了吗？
Has the reason that the people must leave here been revealed to you?

348
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:54,697
不，它没有
No, it has not.

349
00:34:55,906 --> 00:34:59,326
- 你不想知道它的秘密吗？  - 不
- Don't you long to know its secrets? - No.

350
00:34:59,493 --> 00:35:05,541
对我来说，只要知道我们到家后会明白一切就足够了
It is enough for me to know we shall understand all when we reach home.

351
00:35:09,879 --> 00:35:13,883
柯克：<i>舰长日志，星历5476.4</i>
KIRK: <i>Captain's log, stardate 5476.4.</i>

352
00:35:14,049 --> 00:35:16,510
<i>我们和尤纳达在一条平行的航线上</i>
<i>We are on a parallel course with Yonada.</i>

353
00:35:16,677 --> 00:35:19,388
<i>它仍在与达兰五号发生碰撞的航向上</i>
<i>It is still on a collision course with Daran V.</i>

354
00:35:19,555 --> 00:35:23,559
<i>由于我们未能校正它的航向，以及麦考伊医生的病</i>
<i>Our failure to correct its course, and Dr. McCoy's illness,</i>

355
00:35:23,726 --> 00:35:27,730
<i>使得我们必须与星际舰队司令部联系</i>
<i>made contact with Starfleet Command imperative.</i>

356
00:35:28,814 --> 00:35:31,901
韦斯特弗利特：<i>柯克舰长，我同意你留下的愿望</i>
WESTERVLIET: <i>Captain Kirk, I sympathize with your wish to stay.</i>

357
00:35:32,067 --> 00:35:36,071
<i>但我希望你认识到继续你的使命的必要性</i>
<i>But I hope you recognize the need to continue your mission.</i>

358
00:35:36,238 --> 00:35:40,743
- 这就是问题所在，长官  - <i>可能我没说清楚</i>
- That is the problem, sir. - <i>Perhaps I haven't made myself clear.</i>

359
00:35:41,076 --> 00:35:42,870
<i>让我重申一下</i>
<i>Let me restate it.</i>

360
00:35:43,162 --> 00:35:47,249
<i>你已被免除对尤纳达的所有责任</i>
<i>You have been relieved of all responsibility for Yonada.</i>

361
00:35:47,416 --> 00:35:50,753
<i>星际舰队司令部会处理这种情况</i>
<i>Starfleet Command will take care of the situation.</i>

362
00:35:57,426 --> 00:36:01,096
我相信是时候继续前进了
I believe it is time to move on.

363
00:36:01,263 --> 00:36:04,433
是的，这些就是命令
Yes, those are the orders.

364
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:07,279
乌乎拉[通过对讲机]：<i>柯克舰长，舰桥呼叫柯克舰长</i>
UHURA [OVER INTERCOM]: <i>Captain Kirk. Bridge to Captain Kirk.</i>

365
00:36:07,414 --> 00:36:08,717
我是柯克

366
00:36:08,854 --> 00:36:12,733
- <i>麦考伊医生的紧急呼叫，长官</i>  - 接通
- <i>An urgent call from Dr. McCoy, sir.</i> - Put him on.

367
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:15,611
- 麦考伊：<i>吉姆？</i>  - 是我，老骨头
- McCOY: <i>Jim?</i> - Yes, Bones.

368
00:36:15,778 --> 00:36:20,241
- <i>我们可以让他们回到正轨</i>  - 你找到控制器了吗？
- <i>We can get them back on course.</i> - You found the controls?

369
00:36:20,407 --> 00:36:24,787
没有，但我看过包含创造者知识的书
No, but I've seen the book that contains knowledge of the creators.

370
00:36:24,995 --> 00:36:27,540
如果你…
And if you...

371
00:36:29,291 --> 00:36:31,585
如果你能得到它…
If you can get to it...

372
00:36:31,752 --> 00:36:33,963
史波克…
Spock...

373
00:36:34,255 --> 00:36:37,299
- <i>…挖掘信息</i>  - 它在哪里？
- <i>...dig out the information.</i> - Where is it?

00:36:37,466 --> 00:36:39,134
[呐喊]
[SHOUTS]

375
00:36:39,468 --> 00:36:42,221
老骨头，你没事吧？回答我！
Bones, are you all right? Answer me!

376
00:36:43,305 --> 00:36:45,391
<i>老骨头，是什么？</i>
<i>Bones, what is it?</i>

377
00:36:47,017 --> 00:36:49,019
<i>老骨头，是什么？</i>
<i>Bones, what is it?</i>

378
00:36:50,938 --> 00:36:53,399
<i>麦考伊，怎么了？</i>
<i>McCoy, what's happening?</i>

379
00:36:53,566 --> 00:36:55,317
<i>怎么了，麦考伊？</i>
<i>What's happening, McCoy?</i>

380
00:37:15,546 --> 00:37:17,506
你杀了你朋友
You are killers of your friend.

381
00:37:17,673 --> 00:37:19,675
我要把你处死
I will have you put to death.

382
00:37:19,842 --> 00:37:22,177
除非你死了，否则他不会服从
Until you are dead, he will disobey.

383
00:37:22,344 --> 00:37:25,472
- 我要看着你死！- 照顾好麦考伊
- I will see you die! - Take care of McCoy.

384
00:37:54,501 --> 00:37:57,546
他不是我们人民的一部分
He is not part of our people.

385
00:37:57,713 --> 00:38:00,883
你已经解除了他服从的誓言
You've released him from his vow of obedience.

386
00:38:01,050 --> 00:38:05,387
我们已经将他从你们的神谕的暴行中解放出来了
We have freed him from the cruelty of your Oracle.

387
00:38:05,596 --> 00:38:06,639
[呻吟]
[GROANS]

388
00:38:06,805 --> 00:38:08,724
麦考伊
McCoy.

389
00:38:10,809 --> 00:38:11,894
老骨头
Bones.

390
00:38:12,061 --> 00:38:15,731
你说了一些关于一本书的事情，它在哪里？
You said something about a book. Where is it?

391
00:38:16,065 --> 00:38:18,067
一定不能让他们知道
They must not know.

392
00:38:18,233 --> 00:38:20,694
…神谕室
The... Oracle room.

393
00:38:20,861 --> 00:38:24,114
你们绝不能看这本书，这是亵渎
You will never see the book. It is sacrilege.

394
00:38:24,406 --> 00:38:26,200
守卫！
Guards!

395
00:38:26,492 --> 00:38:28,202
守卫！
Guards!

396
00:38:28,827 --> 00:38:33,248
现在听我说，你必须听我要说的话
Now listen to me, you must listen to what I have to say.

397
00:38:36,335 --> 00:38:38,587
给我一点时间和你说话
Give me one moment to speak to you.

398
00:38:38,754 --> 00:38:41,048
就一会儿，纳提拉…
One moment. Natira...

399
00:38:41,215 --> 00:38:44,426
如果你不相信我的话，就叫守卫
If you don't believe what I say, call the guards.

400
00:38:44,635 --> 00:38:48,097
我们将接受您下达的任何惩罚
We'll accept any punishment you decree.

401
00:38:48,389 --> 00:38:51,934
- 你想说什么？  - 你必须相信这是事实
- What do you wish to say? - You must believe it's the truth.

402
00:38:52,142 --> 00:38:57,189
- 你们的真相，你们世界的真相  - 是的，我的世界和你的世界
- Your truth. Of your world. - Yes, my world and your world.

403
00:38:57,356 --> 00:39:01,110
你不服从创造者，你怎么了解我们的世界？
You do not obey the creators. How can you understand my world?

404
00:39:01,276 --> 00:39:03,737
我了解
I understand.

405
00:39:04,697 --> 00:39:06,532
我了解，纳蒂拉
I understand, Natira.

406
00:39:08,951 --> 00:39:14,581
10,000年前，一个太阳正在消亡，它的世界也随之消亡
10,000 years ago, a sun was dying and with it, its world.

407
00:39:14,748 --> 00:39:18,127
正是你在神谕室的饰板上看到的世界
The world you see on the plaque in the Oracle room.

408
00:39:18,293 --> 00:39:22,965
- 尤纳达是那个世界的一部分  - 不
- The world of which Yonada is a part. - No.

409
00:39:23,173 --> 00:39:27,219
那是你们祖先的世界，你们的…创造者
It is the world of your ancestors, your... creators.

410
00:39:27,386 --> 00:39:30,180
它不再存在
It no longer exists.

411
00:39:31,432 --> 00:39:34,435
- 你疯了  - 不，我没有，听我说！
- You are mad. - No, I'm not. Listen to me!

412
00:39:34,601 --> 00:39:36,478
听我说！
Hear me out!

413
00:39:38,439 --> 00:39:42,735
当你们的祖先发现他们的世界即将消亡时
When your ancestors discovered their world was dying,

414
00:39:43,986 --> 00:39:50,159
他们建造了一艘巨大的船并挑选了他们最优秀的人
they built a great ship and chose their best people.

415
00:39:50,325 --> 00:39:54,580
他们希望自己的种族能够延续下去，他们将飞船送入太空
They wished for their race to survive. They sent the ship out into space.

416
00:39:56,415 --> 00:40:00,502
你想让我相信尤纳达是一艘船吗？
You wish me to believe that Yonada is a ship?

417
00:40:00,711 --> 00:40:02,588
是的
Yes.

418
00:40:02,755 --> 00:40:06,133
但我们有太阳，它没有死，晚上，我能看到星星
But we have a sun. It did not die. At night I see the stars.

419
00:40:07,009 --> 00:40:08,969
不
No.

420
00:40:10,137 --> 00:40:14,975
你住在一个空心球里
You are living inside a hollow ball.

421
00:40:15,142 --> 00:40:20,189
你们的祖先创造它，带你踏上旅程
Your ancestors created it to take you on a journey.

422
00:40:20,355 --> 00:40:23,442
前往一颗充满希望的新星球
To a promised new planet.

423
00:40:28,238 --> 00:40:34,036
为什么你们来到尤纳达我们才知道真相？
Why should the truth wait for you to come to Yonada?

424
00:40:34,203 --> 00:40:37,873
控制器有缺陷，除非我们纠正它
A flaw developed in the controls, and unless we correct it,

425
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:41,627
尤纳达将杀死数百万人并摧毁一个它不知道的世界
Yonada will kill millions and destroy a world it doesn't know.

426
00:40:41,794 --> 00:40:43,670
为什么要对我们隐瞒真相？
Why should the truth be kept from us?

427
00:40:43,837 --> 00:40:47,007
为什么创造者要向我们隐瞒？
Why should the creators hide it from us?

428
00:40:47,299 --> 00:40:51,720
不，不，你没有说实话
No. No, you do not speak the truth.

429
00:40:51,887 --> 00:40:55,140
我相信只有神谕，我相信…
I believe only the Oracle. I believe...

430
00:40:55,307 --> 00:40:58,477
让我们移除服从器
Let us remove the Instrument of Obedience,

431
00:40:58,769 --> 00:41:01,271
就像我们为麦考伊所做的
the way we did for McCoy.

432
00:41:03,023 --> 00:41:04,066
纳提拉…
Natira...

433
00:41:14,868 --> 00:41:17,830
你觉得她相信我说的吗？
Do you think she understood me?

434
00:41:28,924 --> 00:41:31,760
她有点相信，她没叫守卫
She understood something. There are no guards.

435
00:41:32,052 --> 00:41:35,597
神谕：<i>你听了非信徒的话</i>
ORACLE: <i>You have listened to the words of the non-believers.</i>

436
00:41:35,806 --> 00:41:38,767
是的，我听了

00:41:38,934 --> 00:41:43,772
<i>那是初犯，你感受到警告的痛苦了吗？</i>
<i>That was the first transgression. You felt the pain of warning?</i>

438
00:41:43,939 --> 00:41:46,942
- 是的，我感受了  - <i>你为什么还要听？</i>
- Yes, I did. - <i>Why did you listen further?</i>

439
00:41:47,109 --> 00:41:51,238
- 他们说他们说的是实话  - <i>他们的真相</i>
- They said they spoke the truth. - <i>Their truth.</i>

440
00:41:52,072 --> 00:41:57,578
- 真相不是所有人的真相吗？  - <i>尤纳达的真相就是你的真相</i>
- Is truth not truth for all? - <i>The truth of Yonada is your truth.</i>

441
00:41:57,744 --> 00:42:02,583
<i>你不必知道别的，悔改你的不顺服</i>
<i>There can be no other for you. Repent your disobedience.</i>

442
00:42:02,749 --> 00:42:06,753
我必须知道世界的真相
I must know the truth of the world.

443
00:42:28,775 --> 00:42:32,070
你的朋友告诉我你的世界
Your friends have told me of your world.

444
00:42:32,237 --> 00:42:37,159
- 他们说的是实话  - 我相信你
- They spoke the truth. - I believe you.

445
00:42:38,327 --> 00:42:44,124
我相信，创造者让我们处于黑暗之中
I believe. The creators kept us in darkness.

446
00:42:44,291 --> 00:42:46,877
我无能为力
There's nothing I can do.

447
00:42:47,169 --> 00:42:50,631
我相信你，丈夫
I believe with you, husband.

448
00:43:11,193 --> 00:43:14,613
- 她还好吗？  - 她会好的，我会陪她
- Is she all right? - She will be. I'll stay with her.

449
00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:17,699
那本书在石碑中
The book is in the monolith.

450
00:43:20,911 --> 00:43:23,163
神谕：<i>这是对圣殿的亵渎</i>
ORACLE: <i>It is sacrilege to the temple.</i>

451
00:43:23,330 --> 00:43:26,833
我们这样做是为了尤纳达人民的生存
We do this for the survival of the people of Yonada.

452
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:30,504
<i>你们不相信，你们被禁止看这本书</i>
<i>You do not believe. You are forbidden to gaze at the book.</i>

453
00:43:30,671 --> 00:43:35,342
我们无意亵渎你的信仰，我们必须查阅这本书
We mean no desecration to your faith. We must consult the book.

454
00:43:35,509 --> 00:43:39,888
<i>这是亵渎，禁止这么做，惩罚是死</i>
<i>It is blasphemy. You are forbidden. The punishment is death.</i>

455
00:43:40,055 --> 00:43:41,723

[THUNDER CRACK]

456
00:43:53,068 --> 00:43:56,071
温度111度并不断上升
Temperature 111 degrees and rising.

457
00:43:56,238 --> 00:43:59,741

- 有索引吗？  - 是的

462
00:44:18,677 --> 00:44:21,096
快点，史波克

466
00:45:05,807 --> 00:45:08,643
现在我们在这儿没事了
We'll be all right here, now.

467
00:45:15,567 --> 00:45:18,320
神谕不能再惩罚我们了
The Oracle can no longer punish us.

468
00:45:18,528 --> 00:45:21,990
- 你的朋友们阻止了它吗？  - 是的

469
00:45:22,157 --> 00:45:26,078
他们会让这个…船
And will they send this... ship,

470
00:45:26,244 --> 00:45:28,955
再次前往创造者想去的地方？

00:45:29,122 --> 00:45:30,624
是的
Yes.

472
00:45:32,334 --> 00:45:34,252
那很好

473
00:45:36,338 --> 00:45:39,674
可运行，与<i>企业号</i>没有太大区别

474
00:45:39,841 --> 00:45:43,929
八根管子里有一根似乎有问题
There seems to be a weakness in one of the eight tubes.

475
00:45:44,096 --> 00:45:46,681
- 足以校正它的航线吗？  - 是的
- Enough to turn it off course? - Yes.

476
00:45:46,848 --> 00:45:49,184
让我检查一下那个引擎

史波克：一个非常简单的问题，很容易纠正

你打算留在这里，在尤纳达？

我会心甘情愿地留下来，因为那是我必须做的

不，麦科伊不会在年富力强的时候放弃生命

也许有一天，如果可能的话
