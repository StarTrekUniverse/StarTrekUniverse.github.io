就我看来

这只是负面的部分，史波克先生

我看过那些记录

微妙的神秘力量
a kind of subtle, mystical power

36

那必须等多尔曼上船

多尔曼？什么是多尔曼？

相互理解

83
00:04:55,305 --> 00:04:56,174

大使我想和你说句话

告诉我发生什么了

94
00:05:31,413 --> 00:05:33,847
那个…生物，伊兰
That creature ... Elaan

95
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:36,349
将成为我们统治者的妻子
is to be the wife of our ruler

96
00:05:36,638 --> 00:05:37,692
带来和平
to bring peace.

97
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:40,126
我们的两个敌对的星球
Our two warring planets

98
00:05:40,126 --> 00:05:42,856
现在拥有相互毁灭的能力
now possess the capability of mutual destruction.

99
00:05:43,396 --> 00:05:46,360
必须找到某种共存的方法
Some method of coexistence must be found.

100
00:05:46,841 --> 00:05:47,493
我明白了
I see.

101
00:05:47,612 --> 00:05:49,307
所以我们回特洛伊乌斯
So, we go back to Troyius?

102
00:05:49,438 --> 00:05:52,365
是的，但是慢慢走，舰长
Yes. Ah, but slowly, Captain.

103
00:05:52,434 --> 00:05:54,368
我需要时间
I will need time.

104
00:05:55,077 --> 00:05:55,869
在我们到达那里之前
Before we reach there,

105
00:05:55,937 --> 00:05:58,371
必须教她文明礼貌
she must be taught civilized manners.

106
00:05:59,097 --> 00:06:00,374
以她现在的样子
In her present condition,

107
00:06:00,442 --> 00:06:02,376
我的人民永远不会接受她
my people would never accept her.

108
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:05,311
你要当她的老师？
And you are to be her teacher?

109
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:07,314
那是给我的命令
Those are my orders.

110
00:06:07,931 --> 00:06:09,816
我必须要求你和你的船员
I must ask you and your crew

111
00:06:09,884 --> 00:06:13,320
尊重，或者至少容忍他们的傲慢
to respect, or at least tolerate, their arrogance.

112
00:06:13,788 --> 00:06:16,323
摩擦必须保持在最低限度
Friction must be kept at a minimum.

113
00:06:16,391 --> 00:06:18,325
好的，我能理解
Yes, that I can understand.

114
00:06:18,393 --> 00:06:21,328
另一件事你应该明白，舰长
Another thing you should understand, Captain.

115
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,882
你和我一样处于危险中
You have as much at stake as I have.

116
00:06:24,403 --> 00:06:26,011
你的上级说
Your superiors made the statement

117
00:06:26,011 --> 00:06:27,675
这次任务要是失败
that failure of this mission

118
00:06:27,902 --> 00:06:30,619
对联邦和我们两个星球来说
would be as catastrophic for Federation planning

119
00:06:30,905 --> 00:06:32,574
都是灾难性的
as it would be for our two planets.

120
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:38,507
以接受这样的女王为代价换取和平
To gain peace at the price of accepting such a queen

121
00:06:39,137 --> 00:06:41,245
不是胜利
is no victory.

122
00:06:42,617 --> 00:06:45,428
我会送她 我带来的正式礼物
I will take her the official gifts I bear.

123
00:06:45,819 --> 00:06:49,362
也许那会缓和她的情绪
Perhaps that will soften her mood.

124
00:06:56,903 --> 00:06:58,663
契科夫先生，设定前往特洛伊乌斯的航线
Mr. Chekov, lay in a course for Troyius.

125
00:06:59,184 --> 00:07:01,292

126

128
00:07:05,098 --> 00:07:06,649
是的，没错，苏鲁先生

129

亚光系数.037

130
00:07:11,348 --> 00:07:12,227
是的，长官
Aye, aye, sir.

131
00:07:12,397 --> 00:07:13,179
舰长
Captain,

132
00:07:14,668 --> 00:07:16,352
你不用曲速引擎？
you'll not be using the warp drive?

133
00:07:18,166 --> 00:07:19,481
全程用脉冲？
All the way on impulse?

134
00:07:21,904 --> 00:07:24,164
这将花费大量时间
That'll take a great deal of time.

135
00:07:24,528 --> 00:07:25,696
你赶时间吗，斯科特先生？
You in a hurry, Mr. Scott?

136
00:07:27,228 --> 00:07:27,869
不
No.

137
00:07:30,234 --> 00:07:32,357
舰长，多尔曼
Captain, the Dohlman is dissatisfied

138
00:07:32,357 --> 00:07:33,965
对提供的住处不满意
with the quarters provided.

139
00:07:34,791 --> 00:07:36,192
他们怎么了，史波克？
What's the matter with them, Mr. Spock?

140
00:07:36,268 --> 00:07:37,073
我不知道
I do not know,

141
00:07:37,073 --> 00:07:40,397
所有伊拉希人看起来都很不理性
but all the Elasians seem most irrational.

142
00:07:40,973 --> 00:07:42,386
我放弃了我的宿舍，因为…
I gave up my quarters because...

143
00:07:42,386 --> 00:07:44,450
是的，我感谢你的牺牲，乌乎拉上尉
Yes, I appreciate your sacrifice, Lieutenant Uhura.

144
00:07:44,657 --> 00:07:45,852
我会亲自和她谈谈
I'll talk to her myself.

145
00:07:52,274 --> 00:07:54,121
猪猡！收回你的礼物
Swine! Take back your gifts!

146
00:07:55,359 --> 00:07:56,624
殿下
Your Glory ...

147
00:07:56,891 --> 00:07:59,120
这是你的婚礼拖鞋
these are your wedding slippers.

148
00:07:59,271 --> 00:08:00,993
你的统治者收买不了
Your ruler cannot buy the favours

149
00:08:01,065 --> 00:08:02,396
埃拉斯的多尔曼的欢心
of the Dohlman of Elas.

150
00:08:02,705 --> 00:08:05,435
这…这是你的婚礼礼服
This ... This is your wedding dress,

151
00:08:05,502 --> 00:08:07,993
来自新郎母亲的礼物
a gift from the bridegroom's mother.

152
00:08:08,072 --> 00:08:09,903
我不要他的任何东西！
I want nothing of his!

153
00:08:09,973 --> 00:08:14,532
这…这是最珍贵的皇家珠宝…
This ... This is the most prized of royal jewels ...

154
00:08:14,917 --> 00:08:16,656
戴在你优美的脖子上

我会勒死，如果我把

156
00:08:18,525 --> 00:08:20,937
一只特洛伊狗的礼物戴在脖子上
the gift of a Troyian dog around my neck.

157
00:08:23,186 --> 00:08:25,746
克莱顿，谁允许他进来的？
Kryton, by whose permission did he enter?

158
00:08:26,837 --> 00:08:28,695
他是应您的传召来的
He came in answer to your summons.

159
00:08:29,108 --> 00:08:31,773
我知道你对住处不满意
I understand you're not happy with your quarters.

160
00:08:32,313 --> 00:08:33,052
住处？
Quarters?

161
00:08:33,052 --> 00:08:33,661
[玻璃碎裂]
[Glass Breaks]

162
00:08:34,095 --> 00:08:36,825
是的，一点都不满意
Yes, not happy at all.

163
00:08:37,170 --> 00:08:39,269
我是一只柔弱的特洛伊小鹿
Am I a soft Troyian fawn

164
00:08:39,387 --> 00:08:41,203
需要枕头坐吗？
to need pillows to sit on?

165
00:08:41,271 --> 00:08:43,961
还有这些可笑的女性装饰
And these ridiculous female trappings.

166
00:08:43,961 --> 00:08:45,569
冒犯了我的眼睛
They are an offense to my eyes.

167
00:08:46,124 --> 00:08:50,233
我的通讯官慷慨地腾出房间
My communications officer generously vacated the rooms

168
00:08:50,405 --> 00:08:52,374
希望你能满意
hoping you would find it satisfactory.

169
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:53,708
我不这么认为
I do not find them so.

170
00:08:54,045 --> 00:08:56,541
而且我更不满意他
I find him even less satisfactory.

171
00:08:57,254 --> 00:09:00,053
一定要让那个大使呆在你的船上
Must my bitterness be compounded with that ridiculous ambassador

172
00:09:00,618 --> 00:09:02,400
增加我的痛苦吗？
aboard your ship?

173
00:09:03,107 --> 00:09:05,834
我向殿下解释说
I explained to Her Glory

174
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:09,165
她的贵族议会和特洛伊乌斯法庭
that her council of nobles and the Troyius Tribunal

175
00:09:09,233 --> 00:09:11,463
共同同意，我应该教导…
Jointly agreed that I should instruct ...

176
00:09:14,352 --> 00:09:15,645
让她熟悉
make her acquainted

177
00:09:15,645 --> 00:09:17,916
我们人民的习俗和礼仪
with the customs and manners of our people.

178
00:09:18,796 --> 00:09:19,731
克莱顿
Kryton!

179
00:09:20,024 --> 00:09:21,035
把他弄走！
Remove him!

180
00:09:24,523 --> 00:09:26,359
带上那些垃圾！
And take that garbage with you!

181
00:09:42,625 --> 00:09:44,197
他居然敢
He dare to suggest

182
00:09:44,268 --> 00:09:47,025
让我学习他人民的奴性！
that I adopt the servile manners of his people!

183
00:09:48,134 --> 00:09:50,205
殿下似乎没有
Your Glory doesn't seem to be responding

184
00:09:50,274 --> 00:09:51,198
响应指令
to instruction.

185
00:09:52,165 --> 00:09:54,209
我永远不会原谅议会
I will never forgive the council

186
00:09:54,686 --> 00:09:56,359
让我经受这种折磨
for putting me through this torture.

187
00:09:59,412 --> 00:10:02,694
你是应我的要求来解决住处问题的吗？
Were you responding to my demand for better quarters?

188
00:10:03,353 --> 00:10:04,399
没有更好的了
There are none better.

189
00:10:04,519 --> 00:10:06,138
我建议你凑合着住
I suggest you make do with these.

190
00:10:06,562 --> 00:10:07,494
你建议？
You suggest?

191
00:10:08,322 --> 00:10:09,854
没有空余的房间了
There are no more available.

192
00:10:09,854 --> 00:10:12,087
但如果这是你获得满足感的唯一方式
But if that's the only way you can get gratification,

193
00:10:12,162 --> 00:10:15,602
我会让人把整间屋子都装满能砸的东西
I'll arrange to have the whole room filled from floor to ceiling with breakable objects.

194
00:10:16,134 --> 00:10:17,829
我不会让你羞辱我的！
I will not be humiliated!

195
00:10:20,035 --> 00:10:21,980
那就举止文明一点
Then act in a civilized fashion.

196
00:10:22,426 --> 00:10:25,862
我没有允许你离开
I did not give you permission to leave!

197
00:10:26,946 --> 00:10:28,441
我没有请求允许
I didn't ask for any.

198
00:10:29,825 --> 00:10:30,694
哦！
Oh!

199
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:35,866
舰长，我想联系我的政府
Captain, I wish to contact my government.

200
00:10:36,018 --> 00:10:37,508
我无法完成我的使命
I cannot fulfil my mission.

201
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:39,300
这是对我们统治者的侮辱
It would be an insult to our ruler

202
00:10:39,398 --> 00:10:41,038
把这个积习难改的怪物当新娘带回去
to bring this incorrigible monster as a bride!

203
00:10:41,038 --> 00:10:45,454
大使！这应该是个和平任务
Ambassador! This is supposed to be a peaceful mission.

204
00:10:46,384 --> 00:10:48,068
我们之间不可能有和平
There cannot be peace between us.

205
00:10:48,633 --> 00:10:50,307
我们自欺欺人了
We have deluded ourselves.

206
00:10:51,274 --> 00:10:53,925
舰长，当我靠近他们时，我不想要和平
Captain, when I am near them, I do not want peace.

207
00:10:54,588 --> 00:10:56,522
我想杀了他们！
I want to kill them.

208
00:10:57,554 --> 00:10:58,804
你和她一样坏
You're as bad as she is.

209
00:10:59,282 --> 00:11:00,683
你们不需要彼此喜欢
It's not required that you like each other.

210
00:11:00,683 --> 00:11:02,976
做你的工作
Just do your job.

211
00:11:03,248 --> 00:11:05,867
工作？这份工作是不可能完成的
The job? The job is impossible.

212
00:11:06,127 --> 00:11:07,215
我们无法与我们厌恶的人
We cannot make peace

213
00:11:07,284 --> 00:11:08,717
和平相处
with people we detest.

214
00:11:08,785 --> 00:11:09,930
不要试图互相残杀
Stop trying to kill each other!

215
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:12,342
然后友好相处
Then worry about being friendly.

216
00:11:12,789 --> 00:11:14,157
但如果她不听我的…
But if she won't listen to me ...

217
00:11:14,157 --> 00:11:15,743
那就让她听，大使！
Then make her listen, Ambassador.

218
00:11:16,276 --> 00:11:18,362
用别的方法
Use a different approach.

219
00:11:18,795 --> 00:11:19,894
别用外交辞令
Stop being so diplomatic.

220
00:11:19,894 --> 00:11:21,327
她崇尚强权
She respects strength.

221
00:11:21,798 --> 00:11:22,860
强硬点
Go in strong.

222
00:11:31,704 --> 00:11:35,071
起初它似乎是一个传感器幽灵
At first it appeared to be a sensor ghost,

223
00:11:35,141 --> 00:11:37,442
但我已经对所有仪器进行了检查
but I've run checks on all the instrumentation.

224
00:11:37,692 --> 00:11:39,702
所有设备都运行良好
All the equipment is functioning perfectly.

225
00:11:40,593 --> 00:11:42,026
氢云反射？
Hydrogen cloud reflection?

226
00:11:42,603 --> 00:11:43,918
该地区没有
None in this area.

227
00:11:43,918 --> 00:11:45,209
没有东西能解释
Nothing that would account for it.

228
00:11:45,689 --> 00:11:47,416
幽灵断断续续地出现
The ghost appears intermittently.

229
00:11:47,894 --> 00:11:49,120
推测？
Speculation?

230
00:11:50,698 --> 00:11:51,513
没有，舰长
None, Captain.

231
00:11:51,741 --> 00:11:53,023
数据不足
Insufficient data.

232
00:11:53,957 --> 00:11:55,526
这不是仪器故障
It's not an instrument malfunction.

233
00:11:55,594 --> 00:11:57,641
这不是自然现象的反射
It's not a reflection from a natural phenomenon.

234
00:11:59,499 --> 00:12:00,357
一艘飞船？
A spaceship?

235
00:12:00,662 --> 00:12:02,590
[斯科提] 轮机部呼叫柯克舰长
[Scotty] Engineering to Captain Kirk.

236
00:12:03,769 --> 00:12:04,895
我是柯克
Kirk here.

237
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:06,953
舰长，我懂你说的
Captain, I know what you said

238
00:12:06,953 --> 00:12:08,386
尊重的意思
about showing respect,

239
00:12:08,386 --> 00:12:10,377
但是必须让这些人
but must I have these persons

240
00:12:10,821 --> 00:12:12,288
在我的设备周围闲逛吗？
fool around with my equipment?

241
00:12:13,382 --> 00:12:14,450
坚持一下，斯科提
Hang on, Scotty.

242
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:15,613
不管多难忍都要友好
Be pleasant no matter how much it hurts.

243
00:12:15,613 --> 00:12:17,046
我马上下来
I'll be right down.

244
00:12:22,221 --> 00:12:24,142
我们现在只靠脉冲引擎运行
We're only running on impulse engines now.

245
00:12:24,414 --> 00:12:26,526
通常我们只用曲速引擎
Ordinarily, we use the warp engines exclusively.

246
00:12:26,967 --> 00:12:29,902
嗯…我想…
Well ... I suppose ...

247
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:30,790
姑娘…
lassie ...

248
00:12:31,336 --> 00:12:33,052
就算是我们的脉冲引擎
that even our impulse engines

249
00:12:33,052 --> 00:12:34,012
看起来也更快
must seem fast

250
00:12:34,171 --> 00:12:36,605
与你们的核推进装置相比
compared to your nuclear propulsion units.

251
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:38,775
我们感兴趣的
We are interested

252
00:12:38,844 --> 00:12:40,897
是这艘船如何在战斗中使用
in how the ship is used in combat,

253
00:12:41,592 --> 00:12:44,026
而不是它的引擎
not in what drives it.

254
00:12:44,656 --> 00:12:47,284
引擎是机械师和仆人们操心的
Engines are for mechanics and menials.

255
00:12:47,873 --> 00:12:49,786
仆人？
Menials?

256
00:12:50,157 --> 00:12:51,089
没有引擎
Without engines,

257
00:12:51,089 --> 00:12:52,469
就没有战斗或…
there'd be no fighting or ...

258
00:12:52,588 --> 00:12:53,110
[柯克] 斯科特先生！
[Kirk] Mr. Scott!

259
00:12:54,126 --> 00:12:55,787
你应该告诉我
I wish you had told me

260
00:12:55,861 --> 00:12:58,295
你想要参观轮机部
you wanted a tour of the engineering department.

261
00:12:58,363 --> 00:13:00,575
我们没有在这艘船上的自由吗？
Do we not have the freedom of this ship?

262
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:02,965
我们准许你的船员
We have granted your crew the permission

263
00:13:02,965 --> 00:13:04,399
不用在我们面前下跪
not to kneel in our presence.

264
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:05,334
你还想要什么？
What else do you want?

265
00:13:06,388 --> 00:13:08,061
礼貌，记得吗？
Courtesy. Remember?

266
00:13:08,807 --> 00:13:10,741
礼貌不适合低等人
Courtesy is not for inferiors.

267
00:13:11,408 --> 00:13:14,020
礼貌适用于这里的每个人
Courtesy is for everyone around here,

268
00:13:14,211 --> 00:13:15,504
不懂礼貌你会发现你将无法
and you'll find you won't be able

269
00:13:15,504 --> 00:13:17,748
在特洛伊乌斯上生存
to exist on Troyius without it.

270
00:13:19,133 --> 00:13:20,567
斯科特先生，我们的轮机长
Mr. Scott, our chief engineer,

271
00:13:20,567 --> 00:13:21,752
向你展示了他的部门
has shown you his engineering department.

272
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:22,914
这是一种礼貌
That's a courtesy.

273
00:13:22,914 --> 00:13:25,348
你该说谢谢回应
You respond by saying thank you.

274
00:13:30,328 --> 00:13:32,107
[对讲机哨声]
[Intercom Whistles]

275
00:13:32,204 --> 00:13:33,040
[史波克] 舰桥呼叫舰长

276
00:13:37,224 --> 00:13:37,800

277
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:40,169
那个传感器幽灵越来越近了
That sensor ghost is moving closer.

278
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:41,897
我来了
On my way.

[开门]
[Door Opens]

281
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,078
舰长，我们对这个物体进行了短暂定位
Captain, we had a momentary fix on the object,

282
00:13:51,249 --> 00:13:53,208
足以确定它是一艘宇宙飞船
long enough to establish it was a spaceship.

283
00:13:53,349 --> 00:13:53,860
谁的？
Whose?

284
00:13:54,023 --> 00:13:54,947
还没有数据
No data yet.

285
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:56,044
[苏鲁] 舰长！

286
00:13:56,121 --> 00:13:57,317
距离方位，长官

我们的幽灵出现了
Our ghost has materialized.

291
00:14:17,275 --> 00:14:19,038
一艘克林贡军舰
A Klingon warship.

292
00:14:33,558 --> 00:14:34,823
有变化吗，史波克先生？
Any change, Mr. Spock?

293
00:14:35,227 --> 00:14:36,246
没有，舰长
Negative, Captain.

294
00:14:36,366 --> 00:14:39,096
克林贡飞船已进入接触范围
The Klingon ship has simply moved into contact range.

295
00:14:39,096 --> 00:14:40,147
她在根据我们调整
She is pacing us,

296
00:14:40,245 --> 00:14:42,387
精确匹配我们的亚光速
precisely matching our sub light speed

297
00:14:42,387 --> 00:14:44,582
在平行航线上
and on a parallel course.

298
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:00,183
警卫呼叫柯克舰长
Security to Captain Kirk.

299
00:15:00,433 --> 00:15:01,302
我是柯克，怎么了？
Kirk here. What is it?

300
00:15:01,509 --> 00:15:03,084
多尔曼的住处有骚乱，长官
Disturbance in the Dohlman's quarters, sir.

301
00:15:03,084 --> 00:15:03,867
我来了
On my way.

302
00:15:11,326 --> 00:15:12,950
舰长，是佩特里大使
Captain, it's Ambassador Petri.

303
00:15:13,135 --> 00:15:14,862
他们拒绝解释他们发生了什么
They refuse to explain what's happening with them.

304
00:15:17,636 --> 00:15:19,212
殿下没有召见你
Her Glory has not summoned you.

305
00:15:21,606 --> 00:15:24,769
克莱顿，把那头特洛伊猪弄走
Kryton, remove that Troyian pig.

306
00:15:46,885 --> 00:15:49,115
伤口很深，吉姆
It was a deep wound, Jim.

307
00:15:49,187 --> 00:15:52,122
他失了很多血，但他会康复的
He lost a lot of blood, but he'll recover.

308
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:53,623
如果我康复了
If I recover,

309
00:15:53,692 --> 00:15:56,627
也不会感谢你，舰长
it will be no thanks to you, Captain.

310
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:59,999
我说和她谈谈，不是和她打架
I said talk with her, not fight with her.

311
00:16:00,671 --> 00:16:02,104
我就知道不该
I should've known better

312
00:16:02,172 --> 00:16:04,106
手无寸铁地和她谈话
than to talk to her unarmed,

313
00:16:04,174 --> 00:16:06,108
是你强迫我的
but you forced me.

314
00:16:06,811 --> 00:16:09,043
我认为你该对此负责
I hold you responsible for this.

315
00:16:09,435 --> 00:16:11,265
我听说过不情愿的新娘
Well, I've heard of reluctant brides,

316
00:16:11,265 --> 00:16:12,353
但这很荒谬
but this is ridiculous.

317
00:16:13,439 --> 00:16:13,744
柯克舰长
Captain Kirk.

318
00:16:14,146 --> 00:16:15,233
我可以和你谈谈吗，长官？
May I speak with you, sir?

319
00:16:15,406 --> 00:16:16,134
好的，当然
Yes. Certainly.

320
00:16:17,362 --> 00:16:19,796
一条来自星际舰队指挥部的消息
A message just came from Starfleet Command.

321
00:16:19,926 --> 00:16:22,129
属于甲级安全并且加密了
It was class-A security and scrambled.

322
00:16:22,129 --> 00:16:23,360
我把它放入了解码器
I put it through the decoder.

323
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:23,960
是什么？
What was it?

324
00:16:24,207 --> 00:16:25,564
联邦高级专员
The Federation high commissioner

325
00:16:25,633 --> 00:16:28,043
正在前往特洛伊乌斯参加皇室婚礼
is on his way to Troyius to attend the royal wedding.

326
00:16:28,206 --> 00:16:31,490
大使，如果伊拉希亚女人那么凶狠
Ambassador, if Elasian women are that vicious,

327
00:16:31,559 --> 00:16:34,494
为什么男人对她们如此着迷？
why are men so overwhelmingly attracted to them?

328
00:16:34,562 --> 00:16:35,268
我的意思是
I mean,

329
00:16:35,681 --> 00:16:37,579
她们有什么魔法？
what magic do they possess?

330
00:16:37,789 --> 00:16:39,245
不是魔法
It's not magic.

331
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:41,794
是生物化学
It's biochemical.

332
00:16:41,862 --> 00:16:44,296
一个男人一旦碰到
A man whose flesh is once touched

333
00:16:44,365 --> 00:16:46,217
伊拉希亚女人的眼泪
by the tears of a woman of Elas

334
00:16:46,995 --> 00:16:49,481
他的心便会永远被奴役
has his heart enslaved forever.

335
00:16:50,534 --> 00:16:53,544
大使，有一个额外的问题
Ambassador, there's an added complication.

336
00:16:54,123 --> 00:16:55,556
联邦高级专员
The Federation high commissioner

337
00:16:55,625 --> 00:16:56,923
将要参加婚礼
will be attending the wedding.

338
00:16:57,627 --> 00:16:59,129
当他知道新娘试图
The fat will be in the fire

339
00:16:59,129 --> 00:17:01,150
谋杀新郎的大使时
when he learns the bride Just tried to murder

340
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:02,583
会火上浇油
the groom's ambassador.

341
00:17:02,912 --> 00:17:04,846
不会有婚礼
There will be no wedding.

342
00:17:05,583 --> 00:17:08,281
我不会让我们的统治者娶那个怪物
I would not have our ruler marry that monster

343
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:11,286
哪怕整个银河系都指望它
if the entire galaxy depended on it,

344
00:17:13,025 --> 00:17:15,525
我也不会与你打交道了
and I will have nothing further to do with you.

345
00:17:15,525 --> 00:17:17,701
我不是要你和我打交道
I'm not asking you to have anything to do with me.

346
00:17:17,701 --> 00:17:18,752
和她一起做你的工作
Do your job with her.

347
00:17:18,752 --> 00:17:20,241
他什么时候能站起来？
How long before he's on his feet?

348
00:17:20,371 --> 00:17:22,675
几天，至少一周，吉姆
A few days. A week, at least, Jim.

349
00:17:24,157 --> 00:17:26,152
你害我这样，舰长
Here you put me, Captain.

350
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,593
那我就留在这里
Here I will stay.

351
00:17:29,336 --> 00:17:31,607
我没有什么要对你说的了
I have nothing further to say to you.

352
00:17:37,671 --> 00:17:38,539
所以……
So ...

353
00:17:39,158 --> 00:17:41,710
佩特里大使要康复了
Ambassador Petri is going to recover?

354
00:17:42,494 --> 00:17:45,088
那太糟糕了
That is too bad.

355
00:17:45,345 --> 00:17:47,534
消息送到， 你可以走了
You have delivered your message. Now you may go.

356
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:50,111
没有什么比这更让我高兴了，殿下
Nothing would please me more, Your Glory,

357
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:52,566
但你鲁莽的性格…
but your impetuous nature ...

358
00:17:52,675 --> 00:17:55,109
你的特洛伊猪猡在我的住所
Your Troyian pig was in my quarters

359
00:17:55,109 --> 00:17:56,424
未经任何许可
without any permission,

360
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:57,695
于是我捅了他一刀
so I stabbed him.

361
00:17:58,081 --> 00:17:59,401
身为特洛伊人就是原罪
Just to be Troyian is enough.

362
00:18:00,292 --> 00:18:05,801
你们伊拉希亚人 以自己是一个战士而自豪
You Elasians pride yourselves on being a warrior people.

363
00:18:05,801 --> 00:18:07,278
你必须了解纪律
You must understand discipline,

364
00:18:07,702 --> 00:18:09,448
才能下达和接收命令
to be able to give and take orders.

365
00:18:09,526 --> 00:18:12,820
我的命令是带你
My orders are to take you to Troyius

366
00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:14,289
去特洛伊乌斯结婚
to be married

367
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:16,827
并监督你学习特洛伊的习俗
and to see that you learn Troyian customs.

368
00:18:16,894 --> 00:18:18,655
我鄙视特洛伊人
I despise Troyians.

369
00:18:18,905 --> 00:18:21,067
和他们接触让我觉得被玷污
Any contact with them makes me feel soiled.

370
00:18:21,257 --> 00:18:22,265
根据我的经验
It's been my experience

371
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:25,097
当人们相互了解时
that the prejudices people feel about each other

372
00:18:25,467 --> 00:18:27,684
他们对彼此的偏见就会消失
disappear when they get to know each other.

373
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:30,538
我不这么认为
It's not my experience.

374
00:18:34,106 --> 00:18:36,680
我们仍然面临着同样的问题
Well, we're still faced with the same problem.

375
00:18:37,398 --> 00:18:38,604
问题？
Problem?

376
00:18:39,050 --> 00:18:41,418
是的，你学习特洛伊习俗
Yes, the problem of your indoctrination

377
00:18:41,418 --> 00:18:43,265
和礼仪的问题
to Troyian customs and manners.

378
00:18:44,115 --> 00:18:46,049
我已经解决了这个问题
I have eliminated that problem.

379
00:18:46,117 --> 00:18:47,514
你解决了老师
You have eliminated the teacher.

380
00:18:47,514 --> 00:18:48,720
问题还在
The problem still remains.

381
00:18:50,055 --> 00:18:51,121
哦
Oh.

382
00:18:52,164 --> 00:18:54,522
那我们如何解决这个问题？
And how do we solve the problem?

383
00:18:55,402 --> 00:18:57,165
给你……
By ...

384
00:18:57,395 --> 00:19:00,387
找一个新老师
giving you a new teacher.

385
00:19:03,401 --> 00:19:05,062
告诉我， 你能教我什么？
Tell me, what can you teach me?

386
00:19:05,692 --> 00:19:07,170
餐桌礼仪，比如
Table manners, for one thing.

387
00:19:07,494 --> 00:19:08,300
这是一个盘子
This is a plate.

388
00:19:09,462 --> 00:19:11,396
它能盛食物
It contains food.

389
00:19:11,464 --> 00:19:12,602
这是一把刀
This is a knife.

390
00:19:12,744 --> 00:19:14,399
它能切食物
It cuts the food.

391
00:19:14,467 --> 00:19:15,569
这是一个玻璃杯
- This is a glass.

392
00:19:15,569 --> 00:19:16,721
 别烦我！
- Leave me!

393
00:19:16,849 --> 00:19:19,687
不管你喜不喜欢，你都要学
Like it or not, you're going to learn what you've been ordered!

394
00:19:25,634 --> 00:19:27,966
立即送我回伊拉斯
You will return me to Elas immediately.

395
00:19:28,037 --> 00:19:28,727
那不可能
That's impossible.

396
00:19:28,955 --> 00:19:31,335
我命令一切都是可能的
Everything I order is possible.

397
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:33,497
这是我们要解决的第一个问题
That's the first problem we'll work on.

398
00:19:33,497 --> 00:19:34,931
然后我们让你准备去特洛伊乌斯
Then we'll get you ready to go to Troyius.

399
00:19:35,145 --> 00:19:36,908
我不要去特洛伊乌斯
I will not go to Troyius,

400
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:38,572
我不要嫁给一个特洛伊人
I will not be mated to a Troyian,

401
00:19:38,648 --> 00:19:40,582
而且我不会被羞辱
and I will not be humiliated,

402
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:42,678
被送给一只绿猪
and I will not be given to a green pig

403
00:19:42,678 --> 00:19:45,036
作为停战的贿赂
as a bribe to stop a war!

404
00:19:50,958 --> 00:19:53,595
你享受成为多尔曼的特权
You enjoy the privileges and prerogatives of being a Dohlman.

405
00:19:53,903 --> 00:19:55,489
就得尽你的义务
Then be worthy of them.

406
00:19:57,510 --> 00:19:59,672
如果你不想尽
If you don't want the obligations

407
00:19:59,672 --> 00:20:00,853
头衔带来的义务
that go along with the title,

408
00:20:00,926 --> 00:20:02,359
那就放弃它
then give it up.

409
00:20:02,427 --> 00:20:04,224
没人敢这样跟我说话
Nobody speaks to me that way.

410
00:20:04,296 --> 00:20:05,996
那是你的另一个问题
That's another one of your problems.

411
00:20:06,355 --> 00:20:08,821
没人告诉你 你是一个未开化野蛮人，
Nobody's told you that you're an uncivilized savage,

412
00:20:09,049 --> 00:20:11,059
一个女人外表的恶毒孩童
a vicious child in a woman's body,

413
00:20:11,059 --> 00:20:11,972
一个傲慢的怪物
an arrogant monster!

414
00:20:16,975 --> 00:20:18,875
你不该这么对待
That's no way to treat someone

415
00:20:18,944 --> 00:20:20,111
对你说实话的人
who's telling you the truth.

416
00:20:31,346 --> 00:20:33,556
明天的课是关于礼貌的
Tomorrow's lesson will be on courtesy.

417
00:20:49,483 --> 00:20:52,213
上尉，开启呼叫频率

418
00:20:52,286 --> 00:20:53,218
表明身份
Identify us,

419
00:20:53,218 --> 00:20:55,652
并询问克林贡人的意图

420
00:20:55,652 --> 00:20:56,354
是的，长官
Aye, sir.

421
00:21:45,985 --> 00:21:48,010
舰长，克林贡船只
Captain, no response from the Klingon vessel

422
00:21:48,088 --> 00:21:49,453
在任何频道上都没有回应
on any channel.

423
00:21:49,522 --> 00:21:50,853
我知道了，好的，上尉
I see. All right, Lieutenant.

424
00:21:50,924 --> 00:21:52,255
监听所有频率
Monitor all frequencies.

425
00:21:53,349 --> 00:21:54,543
相位炮待命
Phaser crews stand by.

426

保持黄色警报
Maintain yellow alert.

427
00:21:57,108 --> 00:21:57,988
你在做什么？
What are you doing?

428
00:21:59,389 --> 00:22:01,584
啊！
Aah!

429
00:22:36,746 --> 00:22:38,601
任何人不得进入多尔曼的住处
No one may enter the Dohlman's presence.

430
00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:39,602
克莱顿在哪里？
Where's Kryton?

431
00:22:39,671 --> 00:22:40,638
他在忙
On business.

432
00:22:40,705 --> 00:22:42,209
任何人不得进入多尔曼的住处
No one may enter the Dohlman's presence.

433
00:22:42,335 --> 00:22:43,768
能不能告诉殿下
Will you tell Her Glory

434
00:22:43,837 --> 00:22:46,271
柯克舰长请求拜访？
Captain Kirk requests the honour of a visit?

435
00:22:46,883 --> 00:22:48,828
多尔曼承诺我会被鞭打至死
The Dohlman has promised I'll be whipped to death

436
00:22:48,993 --> 00:22:50,762
如果我让柯克舰长走过那扇门
if I let Captain Kirk pass through that door.

437
00:23:00,127 --> 00:23:00,911
谢谢，史波克先生
Thank you, Mr. Spock.

438
00:23:00,911 --> 00:23:02,628
他们醒了，把他们带去警卫室
When they wake up, take them to Security Holding.

439
00:23:02,694 --> 00:23:05,898
舰长，你对情况的分析很完美
Captain, your analysis of the situation was flawless,

440
00:23:05,898 --> 00:23:08,234
预料到她会不让你进去
anticipating that she would deny you admittance.

441
00:23:08,452 --> 00:23:12,548
但是你得出结论的逻辑让我无法理解
However, the logic by which you arrived at your conclusion escapes me.

442
00:23:12,758 --> 00:23:15,352
史波克先生，你们星球上的女人是合乎逻辑的
Mr. Spock, the women on your planet are logical.

443
00:23:15,677 --> 00:23:17,226
那是银河系唯一
That is the only planet in this galaxy

444
00:23:17,226 --> 00:23:18,763
可以做到这一点的行星
that can make that claim.

445
00:23:19,765 --> 00:23:20,697
[开门]
[Door Opens]

446
00:23:24,326 --> 00:23:27,261
你竟然敢碰皇室成员
You dare touch a member of the royal family.

447
00:23:27,477 --> 00:23:29,705
只是自卫
Only in self-defense.

448
00:23:30,943 --> 00:23:33,638
现在你还要不要动手动脚？
Now, are you going to behave or not?

449
00:23:35,309 --> 00:23:37,745
你现在的行为是死罪
The penalty is death for what you are doing.

450
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:39,810
我们不在伊拉斯
We're not on Elas.

451
00:23:40,157 --> 00:23:41,342
我们在我的星舰上
We're on my star ship.

452
00:23:41,342 --> 00:23:42,331
这里我说了算
I command here.

453
00:23:49,767 --> 00:23:52,565
我警告你，舰长，不许再碰我
You are warned, Captain, never to touch me again.

454
00:23:52,637 --> 00:23:54,571
如果我再碰你，殿下
If I touch you again, Your Glory,

455
00:23:54,639 --> 00:23:57,199
那就是在执行一种古老的地球习俗，打屁股
it'll be to administer an ancient Earth custom called a spanking,

456
00:23:57,275 --> 00:23:58,585
一种惩罚
a form of punishment

457
00:23:58,716 --> 00:24:00,478
被宠坏的孩子的方式
administered to spoiled brats.

458
00:24:01,052 --> 00:24:02,946
你可以走了
You have my leave to go.

459
00:24:03,014 --> 00:24:04,447
你忘了，殿下
You forget, Your Glory,

460
00:24:04,515 --> 00:24:07,416
我们还没开始上礼仪课
we haven't started your lesson in courtesy.

461
00:24:07,485 --> 00:24:09,350
你什么都教不了我，舰长
You can teach me nothing, Captain.

462
00:24:09,516 --> 00:24:12,237
哪怕要在这里呆上十光年
If I have to stay here for 10 light-years,

463
00:24:12,423 --> 00:24:14,862
我也不要和你接触而玷污我
I will not be soiled by any contact with you.

464
00:24:15,192 --> 00:24:17,956
很好，那我派史波克先生或麦考伊医生来
Very well. I'll send in Mr. Spock or Dr. McCoy.

465
00:24:18,029 --> 00:24:20,034
无论怎样，你都要为特洛伊乌斯做好充分的准备
Either way, you'll be properly prepared for Troyius

466
00:24:20,415 --> 00:24:23,543
按照议会，统治者和官僚的命令
as ordered by councils, rulers, and bureaucrats.

467
00:24:25,293 --> 00:24:26,465
舰长
Captain ...

468
00:24:27,847 --> 00:24:29,631
你可以教我一件事
there is one thing you can teach me.

469
00:24:29,707 --> 00:24:31,054
不，你一开始就是对的
No, you were right the first time.

470
00:24:31,054 --> 00:24:32,399
我没有东西可以教你
There's nothing I can teach you,

471
00:24:32,399 --> 00:24:33,497
没有事情是你不知道的
there is nothing you do not know.

472
00:24:33,743 --> 00:24:36,371
我不知道如何让人们喜欢我
I don't know how to make people like me.

473
00:24:40,798 --> 00:24:43,167
我不想让每个人都讨厌我
I don't want everybody to hate me.

474
00:24:45,062 --> 00:24:46,495
嗯，不是…
Well, it's not ...

475
00:24:46,563 --> 00:24:48,497
不是人们讨厌你
it's not that people hate you.

476
00:24:49,393 --> 00:24:51,664
只是人们不喜欢被当作
It's just that people don't like to be treated

477
00:24:51,664 --> 00:24:53,174
好像他们不存在
as though they don't exist.

478
00:24:55,652 --> 00:24:57,449
哦……
Ohh ...

479
00:25:08,303 --> 00:25:09,266
它，呃…
It's, uh ...

480
00:25:09,831 --> 00:25:11,157
变得非常，呃…
gotten very, uh ...

481
00:25:12,874 --> 00:25:15,264
一定是通风系统出了问题
Something must've gone wrong with the ventilation system.

482
00:25:16,244 --> 00:25:16,992
舰长……
Captain ...

483
00:25:17,111 --> 00:25:19,198
对不起，殿下
Pardon me, Your Glory.

484
00:25:19,969 --> 00:25:21,392
短暂休息一下
There will be a short recess.

485
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:22,995
舰长？
Captain.

486
00:25:46,264 --> 00:25:47,207
舰长
Captain,

487
00:25:47,275 --> 00:25:51,041
那个叫做打屁股的古老习俗……
that ancient Earth custom called spanking ...

488
00:25:51,112 --> 00:25:51,896
是什么？
what is it?

489
00:25:53,087 --> 00:25:54,391
它是，呃…
It's, um ...

490
00:25:57,933 --> 00:25:59,423
它是，呃…
It's, uh ...

491
00:26:00,606 --> 00:26:02,836
我们稍后再谈
We'll talk about it later.

492
00:26:18,567 --> 00:26:19,761
舰桥呼叫柯克舰长
Bridge to Captain Kirk.

493
00:26:20,126 --> 00:26:20,936
史波克先生…
Mr. Spock ...

494
00:26:20,936 --> 00:26:22,696
传感器捕捉到它了，上尉
I have it on my sensor, Lieutenant.

495
00:26:23,015 --> 00:26:24,448
舰桥呼叫柯克舰长
Bridge to Captain Kirk.

496
00:26:25,825 --> 00:26:26,760

00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:30,324
柯克舰长，请回答

00:26:30,394 --> 00:26:31,452
我是柯克
Kirk here.

499
00:26:31,528 --> 00:26:33,826
哦，舰长，我正在企业号内部
Oh, Captain, I'm picking up transmission

500
00:26:33,897 --> 00:26:35,583
捕捉到了信号传输
from inside the Enterprise.

501
00:26:36,007 --> 00:26:38,492
它位于瞄准克林贡船只的密集光束上
It's on a tight beam aimed at the Klingon vessel.

502
00:26:40,146 --> 00:26:42,137
在企业号内部？
Inside the Enterprise?

503
00:26:44,069 --> 00:26:45,627
你能精确定位吗？
Can you pinpoint it?

504
00:26:45,883 --> 00:26:47,068
我是史波克，舰长
Spock here, Captain.

505
00:26:47,263 --> 00:26:49,094
我正在进行三角测量
I'm triangulating now.

506
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:54,389
它来自轮机部
It's coming from the engineering section.

507
00:26:58,522 --> 00:27:00,114
警卫去轮机部
Security to Engineering.

508
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:01,350
入侵警报
Intruder alert.

509
00:27:03,877 --> 00:27:05,376
所有甲板安全警报
Security alert to all decks.

510
00:27:05,629 --> 00:27:06,561
通话完毕
Kirk out.

511
00:27:28,487 --> 00:27:29,270
没有人看到他
Nobody saw him,

512
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:31,231
但那个家伙不知怎地偷偷溜进了这里
but that devil sneaked in here some way.

513
00:27:31,769 --> 00:27:33,812
沃森因抓住他而被杀
Watson must've caught him and was killed.

514
00:27:33,983 --> 00:27:34,950
他有这个
He had this.

515
00:27:35,017 --> 00:27:36,917
看起来像某种发射器
Looks like some sort of transmitter.

516
00:27:37,883 --> 00:27:39,201
是克林贡人，老骨头？
It's Klingon. Bones?

517
00:27:39,201 --> 00:27:40,133
舰长
Captain.

518
00:27:40,624 --> 00:27:42,057
脖子断得很干脆
Neck snapped clean.

519
00:27:43,982 --> 00:27:45,744
你给克林贡飞船发了什么信号？
What kind of signal did you send the Klingon ship?

520
00:27:46,025 --> 00:27:48,209
舰长，你知道我不会告诉你的
Captain, you must know I will tell you nothing.

521
00:27:49,002 --> 00:27:52,829
我们的审讯技巧比你所能忍受的更令人痛苦
Our interrogation techniques are more excruciating than you're capable of.

522
00:27:52,898 --> 00:27:55,825
是的，我知道你可以抵抗身体上的折磨
Yes, I'm aware you're trained to resist any form of physical torture.

523
00:27:58,183 --> 00:27:58,926
柯克呼叫史波克
Kirk to Spock.

524
00:27:58,994 --> 00:27:59,911
我是史波克，舰长
Spock here, Captain.

525
00:28:00,139 --> 00:28:02,573
史波克先生，是克莱顿在发射信号
Mr. Spock, it was Kryton transmitting.

526
00:28:02,998 --> 00:28:04,246
他不肯开口
He refuses to talk.

527
00:28:04,431 --> 00:28:06,039
我需要你来进行瓦肯心灵融合
I'll need you for the Vulcan mind meld.

528
00:28:14,047 --> 00:28:15,621
舰长，对不起，他似乎…
Captain, I'm sorry. He seemed --

529
00:28:15,689 --> 00:28:17,383
他想掩盖什么？
What was he trying to cover

530
00:28:17,502 --> 00:28:20,045
重要到可以为其付出生命
that was so important he had to die for it?

531
00:28:20,073 --> 00:28:22,007
斯科提，他进入轮机部
Scotty, he didn't come into Engineering

532
00:28:22,075 --> 00:28:23,283
不仅仅为了使用发射器
Just to use the transmitter.

533
00:28:23,837 --> 00:28:25,967
我要你检查你的每个继电器
I want you to heck every relay you've got.

534
00:28:26,456 --> 00:28:28,184
舰长，你必须意识到时间…
Captain, you must realize the time ...

535
00:28:28,252 --> 00:28:30,527
不要浪费时间和我说这个，快去做
Don't waste the time telling me about it. Get to it.

536
00:28:32,366 --> 00:28:32,997
是的
Aye.

537
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:35,029
克莱顿出身于一个贵族家庭
Kryton was of a noble family.

538
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:38,429
他爱我，想娶我
He loved me and wanted to marry me.

539
00:28:39,234 --> 00:28:42,634
当他听说婚礼计划的公告时，他非常生气
He was furious when he heard of the announcement of the wedding plans.

540
00:28:42,776 --> 00:28:46,212
他因为嫉妒而投靠克林贡人？
He sold out to the Klingons because of jealousy?

541
00:28:46,427 --> 00:28:47,687
也许吧
Probably.

542
00:28:48,772 --> 00:28:51,707
但为什么要谈不重要的事情呢？
But why speak of unimportant matters

543
00:28:52,185 --> 00:28:54,335
我们来说说我们的事
when we can speak about us?

544
00:28:56,662 --> 00:28:58,900
外面有一艘克林贡军舰
There's a Klingon warship out there.

545
00:28:59,378 --> 00:29:00,411
他们来干什么？
What's their involvement?

546
00:29:00,411 --> 00:29:01,856
当然，这一切并不是因为
Surely all of this isn't because

547
00:29:02,453 --> 00:29:04,887
他们想终止婚礼
they want to stop a marriage.

548
00:29:05,604 --> 00:29:07,473
我们应该感谢他们的帮助
We should welcome their help.

549
00:29:10,755 --> 00:29:11,667
伊兰
Elaan.

550
00:29:13,645 --> 00:29:16,666
伊兰，两颗行星
Elaan, two planets,

551
00:29:17,024 --> 00:29:20,718
和整个恒星系统的稳定都指望它
an entire star system's stability depends on it.

552
00:29:21,436 --> 00:29:26,972
我们有责任忘记发生的事情
We have a duty to forget what happened.

553
00:29:27,044 --> 00:29:28,671
你能做到吗？
Could you do that?

554
00:29:29,302 --> 00:29:30,910
你能把我给另一个男人吗？
Could you give me to another man?

555
00:29:31,749 --> 00:29:33,312
你我收到的命令
My orders and yours

556
00:29:34,061 --> 00:29:36,908
都说你属于另一个男人
say that you belong to another man.

557
00:29:39,114 --> 00:29:40,450
发生的事情…
What happened ...

558
00:29:43,341 --> 00:29:44,297
发生的事情…
What happened ...

559
00:29:47,031 --> 00:29:47,882
是个意外
was an accident.

560
00:29:49,933 --> 00:29:51,366
不是意外
It was no accident.

561
00:29:52,261 --> 00:29:55,173
我选择了你，你也选择了我
I chose you, and you chose me.

562
00:30:00,144 --> 00:30:01,486
我有个计划
I have a plan.

563
00:30:03,627 --> 00:30:07,940
有了这艘船，你可以彻底消灭特洛伊乌斯
With this ship, you could completely obliterate Troyius.

564
00:30:11,889 --> 00:30:16,187
然后就没有结婚的必要了
Then there will be no need for the marriage.

565
00:30:20,675 --> 00:30:22,229
出于感激
And in gratitude,

566
00:30:23,174 --> 00:30:27,611
我的人民会让你统治整个星系
my people will give you the complete rule of this system.

567
00:30:27,879 --> 00:30:30,150
什么样的头脑会想到这样的事情？
What kind of a mind could think of such a thing?

568
00:30:31,725 --> 00:30:33,283
他是特洛伊人
He's a Troyian.

569
00:30:37,734 --> 00:30:39,361
[对讲机蜂鸣]
[Intercom Buzzes]

571
00:30:42,519 --> 00:30:43,781
[史波克] 舰长？
[Spock] Captain?

572
00:30:45,155 --> 00:30:47,057
你无法抗拒我的爱，亲爱的
You cannot resist my love, my love.

573
00:30:48,325 --> 00:30:49,099
舰长？
Captain?

575
00:31:04,441 --> 00:31:06,238

576
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:11,222
吉姆
Jim.

577
00:31:13,004 --> 00:31:16,911
吉姆，我们可以和你说句话吗？
Jim, may we please have a word with you?

578
00:31:32,169 --> 00:31:35,434
舰长，你没事吧？
Captain, are you all right?

579
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:37,732
她哭了吗，吉姆？
Did she cry, Jim?

580
00:31:37,808 --> 00:31:38,353
什么？
What?

581
00:31:38,546 --> 00:31:39,299
她哭了吗？
Did she cry?

582
00:31:39,299 --> 00:31:40,972
她的眼泪有没有碰到你？
Did her tears touch you at any time?

583
00:31:48,947 --> 00:31:49,822
噢，我们有麻烦了
Oh, we're in trouble.

584
00:31:50,739 --> 00:31:52,894
吉姆，佩特里告诉克莉丝汀
Now listen, Jim, Petri told Christine

585
00:31:53,098 --> 00:31:56,151
伊拉希亚女人的眼泪里有一种生化物质
the Elasian women have a biochemical substance in their tears

586
00:31:56,151 --> 00:31:57,714
就像超级爱情药水一样
that acts like a super love potion.

587
00:31:58,433 --> 00:32:02,025
根据佩特里的说法，它不会消失
According to him, it doesn't wear off.

588
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:04,401
那么是真的吗，舰长？
It is true then, Captain?

589
00:32:05,017 --> 00:32:06,997
这是真的
It's true.

590
00:32:07,853 --> 00:32:09,941
老骨头，你得给我找个解药
Bones, you've got to find me an antidote.

591
00:32:10,011 --> 00:32:11,504
我会试试，我需要测试
I'll try. I'll need tests.

舰长，克林贡飞船改变了航向

596

它正以曲速向我们飞来

597
00:32:27,172 --> 00:32:28,867
我来了
On my way.

603
00:32:55,782 --> 00:32:57,958
他们的速度超过曲速6，舰长
Their speed is better than warp 6, Captain.

604
00:33:00,605 --> 00:33:03,935
契科夫先生，设定航线
Mr. Chekov, lay in a course

605
00:33:03,935 --> 00:33:05,506
把我们带出这个星系
to take us out of this star system.

606
00:33:08,244 --> 00:33:09,396
如果他们想打一架

607
00:33:09,396 --> 00:33:10,733
让我们有一些回旋余地
Let's get some maneuvering room.

00:33:13,482 --> 00:33:14,178
已设定，舰长
Laid in, Captain.

610
00:33:14,362 --> 00:33:16,489
好的，前进，曲速2
All right. Ahead warp factor 2.

611
00:33:16,489 --> 00:33:17,784
[斯科提] 舰长，物质-反物质…
[Scotty] Captain, the matter- antimatter ...

612
00:33:18,656 --> 00:33:20,088
搁置该命令，什么，斯科提？
Belay that order. What, Scotty?

613
00:33:20,759 --> 00:33:22,978
物质-反物质舱被设置为
The antimatter pods are rigged to blow up

614
00:33:22,978 --> 00:33:25,742
在我们进入曲速驱动时爆炸
the moment we go into warp drive.

615
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:43,272
斯科提，那个炸弹……你能拆除吗？
Scotty, that bomb ... can you dismantle it?

616
00:33:43,342 --> 00:33:46,607
不能，会被被炸飞
Not without being blown across the galaxy.

617
00:33:48,317 --> 00:33:49,784
给我脉冲引擎的
Give us every ounce of power you can

618
00:33:49,784 --> 00:33:51,046
所有动力
from the impulse drive.

619
00:33:51,437 --> 00:33:53,304
找到炸弹的解决方案，通话完毕
Find a solution to the bomb. Kirk out.

620
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:57,292
苏鲁先生，操控敏捷一点
Mr. Sulu, stand by to make your maneuvers smartly.

621
00:33:57,292 --> 00:33:58,520
她反应有些迟钝
She'll be sluggish on response.

622
00:33:58,520 --> 00:33:59,259
是的，长官
Aye, sir.

623
00:33:59,710 --> 00:34:01,258
10万公里…
100,000 kilometres.

624
00:34:01,845 --> 00:34:02,703
90…
90.

625
00:34:04,463 --> 00:34:05,550
80…
80.

626
00:34:10,906 --> 00:34:13,187
相位炮，听我的命令准备发射
Phaser crews, stand by to fire on command.

627
00:34:13,257 --> 00:34:14,451
60
60.

628
00:34:15,481 --> 00:34:16,458
准备
Ready.

629
00:34:16,991 --> 00:34:17,676
50
50.

630
00:34:21,098 --> 00:34:22,087
先别开火
Hold your fire.

631
00:34:26,173 --> 00:34:27,922
她没有发射就从我们身边经过了
She's passed us without firing a shot.

632
00:34:28,302 --> 00:34:30,204
我认为他们不打算攻击我们
I don't think they meant to attack us.

633
00:34:35,191 --> 00:34:37,873
这次，我们很幸运
We were very fortunate this time.

634
00:34:43,797 --> 00:34:46,732
是的，他们的战术现在很清楚了，史波克先生
Yes, their tactics are quite clear now, Mr. Spock.

635
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,632
他们想让我们切到曲速引擎
They were trying to make us cut in warp drive.

636
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,805
然后我们会炸毁自己
That way we'd have blown ourselves up

637
00:34:50,951 --> 00:34:52,544
并帮他们解决他们的问题
and solved their problem for them

638
00:34:52,544 --> 00:34:53,978
避免和联邦开战的风险
without risking war with the Federation.

639
00:34:53,978 --> 00:34:54,673
非常利索
Very neat.

640
00:34:54,793 --> 00:34:57,531
你是对的，但为什么克林贡人
You're right. But why do the Klingons

641
00:34:57,531 --> 00:34:59,988
认为占有这个星系这么重要？
consider the possession of this system so vital?

642
00:35:00,791 --> 00:35:03,203
是的，很好的问题，史波克先生
Yes, a very good question, Mr. Spock.

643
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,334
我还有个问题，舰长
I have another question, Captain.

644
00:35:08,402 --> 00:35:11,098
多尔曼不应该远离舰桥吗？
Is not the bridge the wrong place for the Dohlman

645
00:35:11,172 --> 00:35:12,935
在这种时候
at a time like this?

646
00:35:13,007 --> 00:35:14,099
我自有判断……
I'll be the judge ...

647
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:20,640
是的，你…
Yes, you're ...

648
00:35:21,716 --> 00:35:22,876
你说得很对
you're quite right.

649
00:35:25,586 --> 00:35:27,112
谢谢，史波克先生
Thank you, Mr. Spock.

650
00:35:37,256 --> 00:35:38,733
我要你去医务室
I want you to go to Sick Bay.

651
00:35:39,744 --> 00:35:41,385
它是船上最安全的地方
It's the best protected part of the ship.

652
00:35:44,047 --> 00:35:45,546
我希望能在你身边
I want to be by your side.

653
00:35:45,546 --> 00:35:48,719
你在这儿会干扰我的效率…
Your presence here is interfering with my efficiency ...

654
00:35:49,816 --> 00:35:51,663
和我保护你的能力
my ability to protect you.

655
00:35:54,239 --> 00:35:55,586
史波克先生，你来掌舵
Mr. Spock, you have the con.

656
00:36:02,725 --> 00:36:03,637
五号甲板
Deck five.

657
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:06,430
我爱你
I love you.

658
00:36:07,821 --> 00:36:08,994
我选择了你
I have chosen you,

659
00:36:11,037 --> 00:36:13,431
我仍然不明白你为什么不与克林贡人开战
 and still I don't understand why you didn't fight the Klingon.

660
00:36:15,372 --> 00:36:18,005
如果我能通过逃跑来完成我的使命，
If I can accomplish my mission by turning tail and running,

661
00:36:18,005 --> 00:36:19,838
我会很乐意这样做
I'll gladly do that.

662
00:36:20,609 --> 00:36:23,250
那个任务是带我去特洛伊乌斯？
And that mission is to take me to Troyius.

663
00:36:23,945 --> 00:36:24,673
是的
Yes.

664
00:36:28,867 --> 00:36:33,029
你会让我为另一个男人穿上婚纱
Would you have me wearing my wedding dress for another man

665
00:36:33,029 --> 00:36:34,846
并且再也不见你吗？
and never see you again?

666
00:36:37,179 --> 00:36:38,345
是的，伊兰
Yes, Elaan.

667
00:36:39,755 --> 00:36:41,852
你对这样的设想感到高兴吗？
Are you happy at the prospect?

668
00:36:46,263 --> 00:36:46,750
不
No.

669
00:36:46,750 --> 00:36:47,480
[对讲机哨声]
[Intercom Whistles]

670
00:36:47,632 --> 00:36:48,643
斯科特呼叫舰长
Scott to Captain.

671
00:36:50,588 --> 00:36:51,402
我是柯克
Kirk here.

672
00:36:51,472 --> 00:36:52,913
我有一个坏消息，舰长
I've got bad news, Captain.

673
00:36:53,304 --> 00:36:56,966
整个二锂晶体转换器组件熔毁了
The entire dilithium crystal converter assembly is fused.

674
00:36:57,044 --> 00:36:58,335
不可能修复了
No chance of repair.

675
00:36:58,712 --> 00:37:00,454
完全没用了
It's completely unusable.

676
00:37:00,921 --> 00:37:02,648
不可能恢复曲速引擎？
No chance of restoring warp drive?

677
00:37:02,716 --> 00:37:04,506
没有二锂晶体就不可能
Not without dilithium crystals.

678
00:37:04,626 --> 00:37:07,431
我们甚至不能产生足够的能量来发射武器
We can't even generate enough power to fire our weapons.

679
00:37:07,647 --> 00:37:08,418
通话完毕
Kirk out.

680
00:37:09,557 --> 00:37:12,112
伊兰，我得回舰桥
Elaan, I have to go back to the bridge.

681
00:37:12,351 --> 00:37:14,796
请你你务必去医务室
Please, you must go to Sick Bay.

682
00:37:14,796 --> 00:37:14,945
是的，亲爱的
Yes, my love.

683
00:37:14,945 --> 00:37:16,161
是的，亲爱的
Yes, my love.

684
00:37:21,468 --> 00:37:25,404
测试24，三氧化釦在钣溶液中
Test number 24. Colladium trioxide in algobarium solution.

685
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:29,345
结果也是阴性
Results also negative.

686
00:37:29,345 --> 00:37:31,144
医生
Doctor,

687
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:34,875
没有药物能解伊拉希亚人眼泪的毒
there is no antidote to the poison of Elasian tears.

688
00:37:35,256 --> 00:37:37,440
几百年来，伊拉斯的男人
The men of Elas have tried desperately

689
00:37:37,518 --> 00:37:39,374
拼命试图消除它的力量
for centuries to dispel its power.

690
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:42,395
你在浪费时间，医生
You're wasting your time, Doctor.

691
00:37:42,819 --> 00:37:45,274
浪费的也是我的时间，大使
It is my time to waste, Ambassador.

692
00:37:45,274 --> 00:37:49,957
医生，船长让我来这里，安全起见
Doctor, the captain asked me to come here for safety.

693
00:37:50,794 --> 00:37:52,921
安全？
Safety?

694
00:37:52,924 --> 00:37:58,885
医生，你估计我们的生存几率是多少？
What is your estimate of our chances for survival, Doctor?

695
00:37:59,128 --> 00:38:03,155
这是舰长的责任，大使
That is the captain's responsibility, Ambassador.

696
00:38:06,046 --> 00:38:08,514
舰长，来自克林贡飞船的消息
Captain, message from the Klingon ship.

697
00:38:08,514 --> 00:38:11,178
他们命令我们等待登船或被摧毁
They're ordering us to stand by for boarding or be destroyed.

698
00:38:11,363 --> 00:38:12,960
他们要求立即答复
They demand an immediate reply.

699
00:38:13,101 --> 00:38:14,796
他们试图逼我们开战
They're trying to force a fight.

700
00:38:15,748 --> 00:38:17,682
斯科提，我们的动力状态如何？
Scotty, what's our energy status?

701
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:19,684
93%的脉冲动力，长官
93% of impulse power, sir.

702
00:38:19,752 --> 00:38:20,935
我们仍然可以机动飞行
We can still maneuver.

703
00:38:21,254 --> 00:38:23,402
机动飞行？是的
Maneuver? Aye.

704
00:38:23,923 --> 00:38:25,523
我们可以像垃圾船一样
We can wallow like a garbage's cow

705
00:38:25,591 --> 00:38:27,387
绕着一艘曲速驱动的星际飞船打滚
against a warp-driven starship.

706
00:38:27,748 --> 00:38:29,345
我们的护盾能坚持几个回合
Our shields will hold for a few passes,

707
00:38:29,345 --> 00:38:31,344
但没有物质-反物质反应堆
but without the matter- antimatter reactor,

708
00:38:31,344 --> 00:38:32,368
我们没有机会
we've no chance.

709
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:36,016
舰长，在这种紧急情况下你不能呼叫星际舰队吗？
Captain, can you not call Starfleet on this emergency?

710
00:38:36,223 --> 00:38:37,696
让克林贡人知道他们成功地摧毁了我们的曲速引擎？
And let the Klingons know they succeeded in wiping out our warp engines?

711
00:38:39,287 --> 00:38:42,699
在企业号被摧毁前援兵无法到达
Help could not arrive before the Enterprise was destroyed.

712
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:45,344
既然我们都要死了
Now that we are all about to die,

713
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:51,881
我再次请求你接受这条项链
I ask you once again to accept this necklace,

714
00:38:53,314 --> 00:38:54,804
并佩戴它
and to wear it

715
00:38:55,542 --> 00:38:57,194
作为尊重的象征
as a token of respect

716
00:38:57,618 --> 00:39:02,214
为了你我的人民的最后愿望
for the desperate wishes of your people and mine

717
00:39:02,898 --> 00:39:03,952
为了和平
for peace.

718
00:39:09,196 --> 00:39:11,719
你们其他世界的男人只会说
That's all you men of other worlds can speak of,

719
00:39:12,014 --> 00:39:14,253
责任和义务
duty and responsibility.

720
00:39:14,557 --> 00:39:16,089
我们会拖延时间
We'll stall for time.

721
00:39:16,828 --> 00:39:21,006
保持航线，希望能唬住克林贡人
Proceed on course and hope the Klingons can be bluffed,

722
00:39:21,370 --> 00:39:24,054
或者他们没有做好全面战争的准备
or that they're not prepared for a general war.

723
00:39:24,411 --> 00:39:26,606
打开呼叫频率
Open a hailing frequency.

724
00:39:26,737 --> 00:39:28,671
频率已打开，长官
Frequency open, sir.

725
00:39:30,152 --> 00:39:32,086
我是联邦星舰企业号的
This is Captain James Kirk

726
00:39:32,154 --> 00:39:35,473
詹姆斯·柯克舰长，正在处理联邦事务
of the U.S.S. Enterprise on Federation business.

727
00:39:35,991 --> 00:39:37,668
我们的使命是和平的
Our mission is peaceful,

728
00:39:38,233 --> 00:39:41,087
但我们不会接受任何干涉
but we're not prepared to accept any interference.

729
00:39:46,991 --> 00:39:51,664
企业号，准备被登船或摧毁
Enterprise, prepare to be boarded or destroyed.

730
00:39:56,674 --> 00:39:59,609
我想说我们的策略并不完全有效
I'd say our strategy wasn't totally effective.

731
00:40:00,149 --> 00:40:02,111
舰长，克林贡飞船正接近
Captain, the Klingon ship is closing

732
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:03,387
拦截航线
on an intercept course.

733
00:40:03,387 --> 00:40:05,397
50万千米
500,000 kilometres.

734
00:40:05,397 --> 00:40:05,412
升起护盾
Deflector shields up.

735
00:40:05,412 --> 00:40:06,690
升起护盾
Deflector shields up.

736
00:40:08,286 --> 00:40:12,134
斯科提，你能分部分能量给相位炮吗？
Scotty, can you give me partial power on the phaser banks?

737
00:40:12,453 --> 00:40:14,546
不，长官，不可能
No, sir, not a chance.

738
00:40:14,622 --> 00:40:16,283
30万千米
300,000 kilometres.

739
00:40:23,249 --> 00:40:26,164
我告诉过你留在医务室
I told you to stay in Sick Bay.

740
00:40:27,748 --> 00:40:29,768
我想和你一起死
I want to die with you.

741
00:40:35,147 --> 00:40:36,397
我们不会死的
We're not going to die.

742
00:40:37,733 --> 00:40:39,059
现在离开舰桥
Now get off the bridge.

743
00:40:39,059 --> 00:40:40,298
[苏鲁] 10万千米
[苏鲁] 100,000 kilometres.

744
00:40:44,419 --> 00:40:46,887
他掠过了我们，保持护盾升起
He's past us. All shields held.

745
00:40:46,955 --> 00:40:49,360
苏鲁先生，前往143，标记2
Mr. Sulu, bring her to 143 mark 2.

746
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:52,847
保持我们前护盾对着他
Keep our forward shields to him.

747
00:40:52,847 --> 00:40:52,921
他又来了，长官
Here he comes again, sir.

748
00:40:52,921 --> 00:40:54,542
他又来了，长官
Here he comes again, sir.

749
00:40:54,542 --> 00:40:56,476
稳住
Stay with the controls.

750
00:40:56,650 --> 00:40:59,642
保持我们前护盾对着他
Keep our forward shields to him.

751
00:41:06,701 --> 00:41:08,118
超过曲速7
Better than warp 7.

752
00:41:08,244 --> 00:41:09,570
满舵，苏鲁！掉头！
Hard over, Sulu. Bring her around.

753
00:41:09,570 --> 00:41:10,765
他朝我们的侧翼来了
He's going for our flank.

754
00:41:16,350 --> 00:41:17,506
苏鲁！
Sulu!

755
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:20,411
对不起，舰长，用脉冲引擎反应不够快
Sorry, Captain. She won't respond fast enough on impulse.

756
00:41:20,481 --> 00:41:21,391
他又掠过我们了
He's past us again.

757
00:41:21,391 --> 00:41:23,423
4号护盾受损
Damage to number four shield.

758
00:41:24,336 --> 00:41:25,336
多严重？
How bad?

759
00:41:25,542 --> 00:41:29,237
它无受再一次承受进攻，舰长
It will not withstand another full charge, Captain.

760
00:41:31,192 --> 00:41:33,539
我得到了一些非常奇特的能量读数
I'm getting some very peculiar energy readings.

761
00:41:34,474 --> 00:41:36,367
他又和我们平行了
He's paralleling us again.

762
00:41:37,342 --> 00:41:39,544
他似乎中断了攻击
He seems to have broken off the attack.

763
00:41:41,601 --> 00:41:43,192
什么样的读数，史波克先生？
What sort of readings, Mr. Spock?

764
00:41:50,098 --> 00:41:52,826
她是源头
She is the source.

765
00:41:53,804 --> 00:41:54,750
伊兰？
Elaan?

766
00:42:05,669 --> 00:42:06,571
项链
The necklace.

767
00:42:09,189 --> 00:42:10,558
这里面是什么宝石？
What kind of jewels are in this?

768
00:42:10,721 --> 00:42:11,917
他们叫它拉丹斯
They call them radans.

769
00:42:11,917 --> 00:42:14,349
项链应该会给你带来好运
The necklace is supposed to bring you luck.

770
00:42:15,099 --> 00:42:16,350
它的价值不大
It is of little value.

771
00:42:16,350 --> 00:42:17,588
它们是普通的石头
They are common stones.

772
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:23,144
这些是普通石头？
These are common stones?

773
00:42:24,836 --> 00:42:25,859
看到了吗，舰长？
See, Captain?

774
00:42:26,109 --> 00:42:27,700
这里和这里
Here and here.

775
00:42:28,302 --> 00:42:29,325
普通石头？
Common stones?

776
00:42:29,758 --> 00:42:32,104
现在我明白为什么克林贡人对这个星系感兴趣了
Now I see why the Klingons are interested in this system.

777
00:42:33,083 --> 00:42:34,515
可以给我吗？
May I have this?

778
00:42:35,039 --> 00:42:36,951
当然，如果我能帮上忙的话
If I can be of any help, of course.

779
00:42:37,233 --> 00:42:39,407
你也许能救了我们的命
You may have Just saved our lives.

780
00:42:39,407 --> 00:42:43,759
史波克先生，你认为斯科提可以利用二锂晶体吗？
Mr. Spock, do you think Scotty could make use of dilithium crystals?

781
00:42:43,916 --> 00:42:45,007
毫无疑问，舰长
No doubt, Captain.

782
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:47,003
[苏鲁] 他又过来了，长官
[Sulu] He's coming in again, sir.

783
00:42:50,618 --> 00:42:52,551
苏鲁先生，准备好听我的命令
Mr. Sulu, prepare on my order

784
00:42:52,619 --> 00:42:54,380
迅速转向左舷
to turn quickly to port.

785
00:42:54,452 --> 00:42:56,144
尝试保护4号护盾
Try and protect the number four shield.

786
00:42:56,433 --> 00:42:57,364
是的，长官
Aye, sir.

787
00:43:09,385 --> 00:43:10,682
现在，苏鲁，左满舵！
Now, Sulu. hard to port!

788
00:43:15,492 --> 00:43:17,242
护盾还在但是减弱了，长官
Shields holding, but weakened, sir.

789
00:43:17,567 --> 00:43:18,828
舰长
Captain.

790
00:43:19,435 --> 00:43:21,119
有消息
Message coming in.

791
00:43:22,793 --> 00:43:26,802
[克林贡] 企业号，我们的读数证实你们的能量极低，
[Klingon] Enterprise, our readings confirm your power extremely low,

792
00:43:27,064 --> 00:43:28,639
你们的护盾在变形
your shields buckling.

793
00:43:29,269 --> 00:43:32,032
这是你们最后的投降机会
This is your last chance to surrender.

794
00:43:34,126 --> 00:43:36,418
舰长，4号护盾刚刚破裂了
Captain, number four shield just collapsed.

795
00:43:36,886 --> 00:43:39,259
脉冲动力下降到31%
Impulse power down to 31%.

796
00:43:43,405 --> 00:43:45,463
乌乎拉上尉，打开呼叫频率
Lieutenant Uhura, open a hailing frequency.

797
00:43:46,024 --> 00:43:47,136
频道已打开，长官

798
00:43:47,447 --> 00:43:50,000
这是联邦星舰企业号的

799
00:43:50,370 --> 00:43:52,695
詹姆斯·柯克舰长
of the United Spaceship Enterprise.

800
00:43:53,325 --> 00:43:57,519
我可以提投降条件吗？
May I request your terms for surrender?

801
00:43:59,410 --> 00:44:00,518
没有条件
No terms.

802
00:44:01,159 --> 00:44:04,649
必须立即无条件投降
Surrender must be unconditional and immediate.

803
00:44:08,311 --> 00:44:09,937
斯科提，你的估计？
Scotty, your estimate.

804
00:44:10,895 --> 00:44:12,140
我们正在安装，长官
We're fitting it now, sir,

805
00:44:12,601 --> 00:44:14,622
但是我们必须运行测试
but we'll have to run tests to make sure.

806
00:44:14,904 --> 00:44:16,302
在实战中测试吧
Test it in combat.

807
00:44:17,023 --> 00:44:19,710
舰长，这些是粗水晶
Captain, these are crude crystals.

808
00:44:19,913 --> 00:44:23,901
无法判断不规则的形状会对能量流有什么影响
There's no way to judge what the unusual shapes will do to the energy flow.

809
00:44:24,250 --> 00:44:26,379
它们可能炸飞我们……
That could blow us up ...

810
00:44:26,379 --> 00:44:28,449
安装完毕通知我
Let me know when it's in place.

811
00:44:28,517 --> 00:44:29,449
打开呼叫频率
Open a hailing frequency.

812
00:44:29,671 --> 00:44:31,103
打开了，长官
Hailing frequency open, sir.

813
00:44:31,398 --> 00:44:32,951
这是企业号
This is the Enterprise.

814
00:44:33,496 --> 00:44:40,134
你能保证我们的乘客伊拉斯的多尔曼的安全吗？
Will you guarantee the safety of our passenger, the Dohlman from Elas?

815
00:44:40,822 --> 00:44:42,123
没有条件
No conditions.

816
00:44:42,405 --> 00:44:43,996
立即投降
Surrender immediately.

817
00:44:45,457 --> 00:44:47,882
舰长，他开始行动了
Captain, he's starting his run.

818
00:44:53,271 --> 00:44:54,582
[对讲机哨声]
[Intercom Whistles]

819
00:44:54,923 --> 00:44:56,956
斯科特呼叫舰长，安装完毕，长官
Scott to Captain. It's in place, sir,

820
00:44:57,183 --> 00:44:59,358
但后果怎样我不负责
but I can't answer for what happens.

821
00:44:59,428 --> 00:45:00,779
你和史波克上来
You and Spock get up here.

822
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:04,055
苏鲁，准备进行曲速机动飞行

823
00:45:04,130 --> 00:45:04,636
是，长官
Aye, sir.

824
00:45:04,636 --> 00:45:07,068
契科夫，装备光子鱼雷
Chekov, arm photon torpedoes.

825
00:45:07,929 --> 00:45:09,621
光子鱼雷已准备
Photon torpedoes ready.

826
00:45:09,895 --> 00:45:11,167
曲速动力分配给护盾，舰长？
Warp power to the shields, Captain?

827
00:45:11,167 --> 00:45:14,198
不，他的传感器会检测到我们的能量增加
Negative. His sensors will pick up our power increase.

828
00:45:14,567 --> 00:45:16,567
他越认为我们无法反击
The more helpless he thinks we are,

829
00:45:17,067 --> 00:45:18,403
他就会越靠近
the closer he'll come.

830
00:45:18,403 --> 00:45:20,870
当他经过时，我想切入曲速引擎
As he passes, I want to cut in warp drive.

831
00:45:21,489 --> 00:45:25,446
我们将在曲速2时转身，所有武器瞄准
We'll pivot at warp 2 and bring all tubes to bear.

832
00:45:25,604 --> 00:45:26,592
是的，长官
Aye, sir.

833
00:45:26,671 --> 00:45:29,443
契科夫先生，向他大范围发射
Mr. Chekov, give him a full spread

834
00:45:29,443 --> 00:45:30,551
光子鱼雷

835
00:45:30,757 --> 00:45:31,882
是的，舰长
Aye, Captain.

836
00:45:44,991 --> 00:45:46,423
10万千米

837
00:45:47,393 --> 00:45:49,511
斯科提，准备好切入曲速引擎
Scotty, stand by to cut in warp drive.

838
00:45:50,250 --> 00:45:51,181
有波动
Fluctuation.

839
00:45:51,391 --> 00:45:52,260
因为晶体的形状
It's the shape of the crystals.

840
00:45:52,260 --> 00:45:53,249
我就怕这个
I was afraid of that.

841
00:45:53,705 --> 00:45:54,636
75…
75.

842
00:45:55,161 --> 00:45:56,093
70…
70.

843
00:45:57,081 --> 00:45:57,900
60…
60.

844
00:45:59,041 --> 00:45:59,972
50…
50.

845
00:46:00,107 --> 00:46:01,029
在最小射程开火
Fire at minimum range.

846
00:46:01,355 --> 00:46:02,167
40
40.

847
00:46:02,278 --> 00:46:03,382
她不会稳定下来
She won't steady down.

848
00:46:03,450 --> 00:46:04,319
30…
30.

849
00:46:10,619 --> 00:46:13,586
进入曲速，斯科提，所有动力转到护盾
Warp in, Scotty. Full power to shields.

850
00:46:21,706 --> 00:46:22,954
曲速2
Warp factor 2.

851
00:46:24,368 --> 00:46:27,172
设定航线148，标记3
Lay us a course 148 mark 3.

852
00:46:33,517 --> 00:46:34,448
契科夫
Chekov,

853
00:46:35,658 --> 00:46:37,124
光子鱼雷，发射
photon torpedoes fire!

854
00:46:37,194 --> 00:46:37,896
是的，长官
Aye, sir.

855
00:46:45,556 --> 00:46:47,628
直接击中飞船中部
Direct hit amidships by photon torpedo.

856
00:46:47,749 --> 00:46:50,131
克林贡3号盾牌损坏
Damage to Klingon number three shield.

857
00:46:50,199 --> 00:46:51,631
4号盾牌被摧毁
Number four shield obliterated.

858
00:46:51,700 --> 00:46:53,428
失去飞行能力
Loss of maneuver power.

859
00:46:53,501 --> 00:46:55,296
他严重受损，舰长
He's badly damaged, Captain.

860
00:46:55,542 --> 00:46:58,664
继续以低速驶离
Continuing away at reduced speed.

861
00:46:59,377 --> 00:47:01,317
解除战斗部署
Secure from general quarters.

862

干得好，苏鲁先生
Well done, Mr. Sulu.

863
00:47:03,365 --> 00:47:04,297
斯科提
Scotty.

864
00:47:05,125 --> 00:47:07,070
但我不明白
But I don't understand you.

865
00:47:07,548 --> 00:47:09,904
你的意思是你不会追赶并消灭他？
You mean you won't pursue and finish him off?

866
00:47:10,145 --> 00:47:11,133
不
No.

867
00:47:13,296 --> 00:47:15,269
苏鲁先生，继续去特洛伊乌斯的航线
Mr. Sulu, resume course for Troyius.

868
00:47:16,078 --> 00:47:17,137
是的，长官
Aye, aye, sir.

869
00:47:49,109 --> 00:47:51,261
你不传送下去参加仪式吗？
You will not beam down for the ceremony?

870
00:47:52,010 --> 00:47:52,901
不
No.

871
00:47:56,900 --> 00:47:59,054
我希望你拿着这个
I want you to have this

872
00:47:59,122 --> 00:48:02,246
作为私人纪念品
as a personal memento.

873
00:48:03,484 --> 00:48:04,720
我了解到在特洛伊乌斯上
I have learned that on Troyius,

874
00:48:04,791 --> 00:48:06,386
他们不戴这样的东西
they do not wear such things.

875
00:48:11,536 --> 00:48:12,990
记住我
Remember me.

876
00:48:14,698 --> 00:48:16,030
我别无选择
I have no choice.

877
00:48:16,228 --> 00:48:18,592
我也没有
Nor have I.

878
00:48:18,859 --> 00:48:23,466
我只有责任和义务
I have only responsibilities and obligations.

879
00:48:28,443 --> 00:48:29,594
再见
Good-bye.

880
00:48:31,300 --> 00:48:32,527
再见
Good-bye.

881
00:48:44,571 --> 00:48:46,504
传送

882
00:49:04,878 --> 00:49:06,640
现在已经稳定了
It's stabilized now.

883
00:49:08,787 --> 00:49:13,405
史波克，我已经分离出了伊拉希亚眼泪的生化物质
Spock, I've isolated the biochemical substance of the Elasian tears.

884
00:49:13,405 --> 00:49:14,837
它是一种感染
It's a kind of infection,

885
00:49:14,837 --> 00:49:16,556
我想我找到了解药
and I think I found an antidote.

886
00:49:16,556 --> 00:49:17,534
太晚了，医生
Too late, Doctor.

887
00:49:17,534 --> 00:49:19,390
舰长已经找到了他自己的解药
The captain has found his own antidote.

888
00:49:19,511 --> 00:49:20,978
你的瓦肯脑子坏了吗？
Are you out of your Vulcan mind?

889
00:49:20,978 --> 00:49:21,684
你知道我工作了多久吗…
Do you know how long ...

890
00:49:21,684 --> 00:49:25,260
伊拉斯女人的解药是一艘星舰
The antidote to a woman of Elas is a star ship.

891
00:49:25,477 --> 00:49:28,725
企业号在多尔曼之前就感染了舰长
The Enterprise infected the captain before the Dohlman.

892
00:49:29,116 --> 00:49:30,877
苏鲁先生，准备把我们带出轨道
Mr. Sulu, prepare to take us out of orbit.

893
00:49:34,268 --> 00:49:35,516
嗯，我严重怀疑
Well, I doubt seriously

894
00:49:35,516 --> 00:49:39,381
企业号是否有任何解药
if there's any kind of an antidote for the Enterprise.

895
00:49:39,710 --> 00:49:41,927
在这个特殊案例中，医生
In this particular instance, Doctor,

896
00:49:42,372 --> 00:49:43,752
我同意你的看法
I agree with you.

897
00:49:44,393 --> 00:49:46,019
以曲速2前进
Ahead warp factor 2.
