[柯克]舰长日志，星历5730.2
[Kirk] Captain's Log : Star date 5730.2.

2
00:00:07,511 --> 00:00:09,445
阿里安纳斯星球至关重要
The planet Ariannus is vital

3
00:00:09,513 --> 00:00:12,539
作为太空商业通道的中转站
as a transfer point on regular space commercial lanes.

4
00:00:12,616 --> 00:00:14,914
它受到细菌入侵的攻击
It has been attacked by a bacterial invasion

5
00:00:14,985 --> 00:00:17,650
不加以控制会威胁到上面的生命
which threatens to render it lifeless unless checked.

6
00:00:17,847 --> 00:00:20,941
我们的使命是净化它
Our mission... to decontaminate it.

7
00:00:21,158 --> 00:00:24,286
契科夫先生，估计我们到达阿里安纳斯的时间？
Mr. Chekov, an estimated time of arrival for Ariannus?

8
00:00:24,361 --> 00:00:28,923
按照目前的速度，我们的预计到达时间是三小时四分钟，长官
At present speed, our E.T.A. is three hours, four minutes, sir.

9
00:00:28,999 --> 00:00:31,433
乌乎拉上尉，通知行星卫生部
Lieutenant Uhura, advise the planet's ministry of health

10
00:00:31,502 --> 00:00:33,595
我们将开始净化程序
that we'll begin decontamination procedures

11
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:35,899
锁定轨道后立即开始  
immediately upon locking into orbit. 

12
00:00:35,899 --> 00:00:36,901
是的，长官
Aye, aye, sir.

13
00:00:37,269 --> 00:00:38,874
斯科提，这会带来问题吗？
Scotty, will that present any problems?

14
00:00:38,942 --> 00:00:41,001
不会，长官，净化槽正在部署
None, sir. All tanks are being positioned.

15
00:00:41,078 --> 00:00:44,172
舰长，传感器现实前方有太空飞行器
Captain, sensors indicate a space vehicle ahead.

16
00:00:44,248 --> 00:00:45,552
在可视范围内吗？  
Is it within visual range? 

17
00:00:45,552 --> 00:00:47,115
正在进入可视范围
Coming into range now.

18
00:00:47,184 --> 00:00:50,085
它的航线很不稳定
It's following a very erratic course.

19
00:00:50,154 --> 00:00:52,714
把它放在屏幕上，放到最大
Put it on the screen, extreme magnification.

20
00:00:58,395 --> 00:01:00,761
我认为那可能是一艘星际舰队的穿梭机
I think that may be a Starfleet shuttlecraft.

21
00:01:00,831 --> 00:01:03,163
那就是，契科夫先生
That is exactly what it is, Mr. Chekov.

22
00:01:03,233 --> 00:01:06,327
看起来像是从星际基地4偷来的那个
It looks like the one stolen from Star base 4.

23
00:01:06,403 --> 00:01:09,895
乌乎拉上尉，尝试在命令频率2上与他们联系
Lieutenant Uhura, try to contact them on command frequency 2.

24
00:01:09,973 --> 00:01:10,918
是的，舰长
Aye, Captain.

25
00:01:20,211 --> 00:01:21,324
没有反应，长官  
No response, sir. 

26
00:01:21,934 --> 00:01:23,017
尝试所有频率
Try all frequencies.

27
00:01:23,087 --> 00:01:24,598
是的，长官，在所有频率上呼叫
Aye, sir. Hailing on all frequencies.

28
00:01:25,713 --> 00:01:28,687
船上有一个生物，类人动物
There is one living creature aboard...humanoid.

29
00:01:28,759 --> 00:01:31,091
他受伤或生病了
He is either injured or ill.

30
00:01:31,161 --> 00:01:34,255
穿梭机显示内部空气泄漏
His craft shows internal atmospheric leakage.

31
00:01:34,331 --> 00:01:36,424
该生物可能会窒息
The creature may be suffocating.

32
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:38,627
[柯克]苏鲁上尉，激活牵引光束
[Kirk] Lieutenant Sulu, activate tractor beams.

33
00:01:38,702 --> 00:01:42,160
牵引光束已激活，捕获到了，长官
Tractor beams activated. We have it, sir.

34
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:43,632
准备把它带到机库甲板上  
Prepare to bring it aboard. 

35
00:01:43,632 --> 00:01:44,114
是的，长官
Aye, sir.

36
00:01:44,114 --> 00:01:46,784
乌乎拉上尉，派一支警卫队前往压力门  
Lieutenant Uhura, send a security team to the pressure doors. 

37
00:01:46,784 --> 00:01:47,315
是的，长官
Aye, sir.

38
00:01:47,315 --> 00:01:49,315
史波克先生，跟我来，斯科提
Mr. Spock, come with me. Scotty.

39
00:01:56,153 --> 00:01:58,178
[广播]机库门已打开
[Loudspeaker] Hangar doors open and clearing

40
00:01:58,255 --> 00:02:00,450
正在清理穿梭机入口
for entrance of shuttlecraft.

41
00:02:00,524 --> 00:02:03,652
穿梭机接近机库甲板
Shuttlecraft approaching hangar deck.

42
00:02:09,435 --> 00:02:10,677
[苏鲁]舰桥呼叫柯克舰长  
[Sulu]Bridge to Captain Kirk. 

43
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:11,895
我是柯克
Kirk here.

44
00:02:11,969 --> 00:02:14,233
机库门已关闭，甲板正在加压
Hangar doors are closed, and deck is pressurizing.

45
00:02:14,304 --> 00:02:15,395
收到
Acknowledged.

46
00:02:28,018 --> 00:02:31,681
一开门我们就进去，听我的指挥
We'll enter as soon as the doors open, and we'll go on my command.

47
00:02:31,755 --> 00:02:34,053
[按钮哔哔声]
[Button Beeps]

48
00:02:58,649 --> 00:03:01,584
柯克：宇宙，最后的边疆
Space, the final frontier.

49
00:03:07,624 --> 00:03:11,788
这些是星舰企业号的航程
These are the voyages of the star ship Enterprise.

50
00:03:11,862 --> 00:03:15,992
它的五年任务：探索未知的新世界
Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds,

51
00:03:16,066 --> 00:03:19,968
寻找新生命和新文明
to seek out new life and new civilizations,

52
00:03:20,037 --> 00:03:23,370
勇踏前人未至之境
to boldly go where no man has gone before.

53
00:03:55,718 --> 00:03:58,614
让那成为你们最后的战场
Let That Be Your Last Battlefield

54
00:04:06,326 --> 00:04:09,992
医生，你确定这种肤色
You are certain, Doctor, that this pigmentation

55
00:04:10,063 --> 00:04:12,793
是这个人的正常状况吗？
is the natural condition of this individual?

56
00:04:12,866 --> 00:04:14,891
那是我记录的，史波克先生
That's what I've recorded, Mr. Spock.

57
00:04:14,968 --> 00:04:17,266
我们知道有哪个星球
Do we have any knowledge of a planet

58
00:04:17,337 --> 00:04:20,272
可能产生这样一个种族吗？
that could have produced such a race of beings?

59
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:23,002
不知道，舰长  - 老骨头，你怎么看？
Negative, Captain. - Bones, what do you make of it?

60
00:04:23,076 --> 00:04:26,409
我无法给出具体解释
I can't give you any specific circumstance that will explain him.

61
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:29,414
从他身上看，我们至少知道
And judging by looking at him, we know at the very least

62
00:04:29,482 --> 00:04:32,212
他是一个戏剧性冲突的结果
he is the result of a very dramatic conflict.

63
00:04:32,285 --> 00:04:33,775
史波克？
Spock?

64
00:04:33,853 --> 00:04:36,344
舰长，从孟德尔的基础规律
There is no theory, Captain, from the basic work of Mendel

65
00:04:36,423 --> 00:04:39,881
到最近的核苷酸研究，没有理论能解释我们俘获的东西
to the most recent nucleotide studies, which would explain our captive.

66
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:42,758
所有颜色渐变，从黑色到棕色
All gradations of colour from black to brown,

67
00:04:42,829 --> 00:04:46,060
到黄色到白色，在基因上都是可以预测的
to yellow to white are genetically predictable.

68
00:04:46,132 --> 00:04:49,568
因此，我们必须得出结论，这个外星人
We must therefore conclude that this alien

69
00:04:49,636 --> 00:04:53,072
是通常无法解释的稀有物种
is that often unaccountable rarity...

70
00:04:53,139 --> 00:04:55,403
一种突变体，独一无二
a mutation, one of a kind.

71
00:04:55,475 --> 00:04:57,902
是的，我同意，就是这样 
Yes, I would agree. That's the case.

72
00:04:57,902 --> 00:04:59,275
你的预后呢，医生？
Your prognosis, Doctor?

73
00:04:59,275 --> 00:04:59,346
你的预后呢，医生？

74
00:04:59,346 --> 00:05:01,576
我不能给你，吉姆，我从来没有治疗过
Well, I can't give you one. I've never worked on anyone

75
00:05:01,915 --> 00:05:03,445
他这样的人或东西
or anything like him.

76
00:05:03,516 --> 00:05:06,904
然而，你却在给他灌满有毒的药水
Yet, you are pumping him full of your noxious potions

77
00:05:06,904 --> 00:05:07,913
就好像他是人类一样
as if he were a human.

78
00:05:08,872 --> 00:05:12,015
史波克先生，当有疑问时，要遵守规章手册
When in doubt, the book prevails, Mr. Spock!

79
00:05:12,092 --> 00:05:15,619
我已经测试了，血就是血，哪怕是和你一样绿色的
I've run tests. Blood is blood, even when it's green like yours.

80
00:05:15,907 --> 00:05:17,560
器官在那里
The organs are there.

81
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:21,361
它们在一定程度上被重新排列，还有一些我以前从未见过的
They're rearranged to a degree, plus a few I've never seen before.

82
00:05:21,434 --> 00:05:23,918
现在我增加了他血液中的含氧量
Now, I've enriched the oxygen content of his blood

83
00:05:23,918 --> 00:05:25,902
并注入强烈的兴奋剂
and pumped in a strong stimulant.

84
00:05:27,963 --> 00:05:32,541
而且我必须说他的恢复能力似乎非常好
And I must say, his recuperative powers appear to be excellent.

85
00:05:32,612 --> 00:05:34,842
如果你允许，我要做进一步的研究
With your permission, Captain, I shall do some further research

86
00:05:34,914 --> 00:05:37,542
并在舰桥和你会合
and join you on the bridge.

87
00:05:37,617 --> 00:05:39,380
他苏醒了，博士
He's coming around, Doctor.

88
00:05:41,892 --> 00:05:43,324
很好
Well!

89
00:05:44,724 --> 00:05:48,660
人事不省了一会儿，但你现在已经脱离了危险
Touch and go there for a minute, but you're out of danger now.

90
00:05:52,799 --> 00:05:55,097
你在星舰企业号上
You're aboard the star ship Enterprise.

91
00:05:57,370 --> 00:06:01,670
我听说过，它是星际舰队的？
I've heard of it. It's in the United Fleet of Planets?

92
00:06:01,741 --> 00:06:05,736
联邦，你乘坐的穿梭机也是联邦的
Federation. So is the shuttlecraft that you were flying.

93
00:06:06,444 --> 00:06:07,279
是吗？
 It was?

94
00:06:07,923 --> 00:06:11,579
你一般不知道你偷的是谁吗？
Don't you usually know whose property you've stolen?

95
00:06:12,204 --> 00:06:13,812
我不是小偷
I am not a thief!

96
00:06:13,887 --> 00:06:15,980
嗯，当然不是普通的小偷
Well, certainly no ordinary thief,

97
00:06:16,056 --> 00:06:19,423
考虑到你…占用的东西
considering what it is you...appropriated.

98
00:06:19,492 --> 00:06:22,017
你的指控太过分了
You're being very loose with your accusations

99
00:06:22,095 --> 00:06:24,859
不知道事实就下结论
and drawing conclusions without any facts.

100
00:06:24,931 --> 00:06:28,492
我知道的是你乘着一艘不属于你的船离开了
I do know you made off with a ship that didn't belong to you.

101
00:06:28,568 --> 00:06:30,331
我没有偷
I do not make off with things.

102
00:06:30,403 --> 00:06:32,460
我的需求给了我使用它的权利
My need gave me the right to use the ship.

103
00:06:32,665 --> 00:06:35,324
记下这个词，先生，它的用途
Mark the word, sir... the use of it!

104
00:06:35,508 --> 00:06:39,171
您可以在星际舰队指挥部尝试这些法律托词
You can try those technical evasions on Starfleet Command.

105
00:06:39,245 --> 00:06:41,132
那是你将面临指控的地方
That's where you'll be facing your charges.

106
00:06:41,748 --> 00:06:44,683
[叹气]我很感激你的救援
[Sighs] I'm grateful for your rescue.

107
00:06:46,252 --> 00:06:50,951
别提了，我们很高兴抓住了你
Don't mention it. We're pleased to have caught you.

108
00:06:51,024 --> 00:06:52,992
你是谁？
Who are you?

109
00:06:53,059 --> 00:06:55,425
我叫洛凯
My name is Lokai.

110
00:06:55,495 --> 00:06:57,429
继续
Go on.

111
00:06:57,497 --> 00:07:00,091
来自谢隆星
From the planet Cheron.

112
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:03,602
那是在银河系的最南端
That's in the southernmost part of the galaxy,

113
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:05,729
在一个未知的象限
in an uncharted quarter.

114
00:07:05,805 --> 00:07:08,706
你离家这么远干什么？
What are you doing so far from home?

115
00:07:10,312 --> 00:07:13,174
你明白，当我们完成我们的任务后
You understand that when we complete our mission,

116
00:07:13,246 --> 00:07:16,841
我们会带你去星际基地，在那里你将面临严重的指控
we'll take you to star base where you'll face a very serious charge.

117
00:07:16,916 --> 00:07:20,825
指控不是问题，我会归还船的，只要我…
The charge is trifling. I would've returned the ship as soon as l...

118
00:07:22,021 --> 00:07:24,083
什么？你打算做什么？
Had what? What were you going to do?

119
00:07:24,508 --> 00:07:28,256
你们人类都是一样的呆板，首先是谴责然后攻击
You monotone humans are all alike. First you condemn and then attack!

120
00:07:30,662 --> 00:07:32,236
我不会再回答任何问题了
I will answer no more questions.

121
00:07:33,337 --> 00:07:38,274
不管我们怎么看他，舰长，他肯定不是普通的人
Well, however we view him, Captain, he's certainly no ordinary specimen.

122
00:07:38,563 --> 00:07:41,364
嗯，洛凯，我不知道对你来说怎样是正常的
Well, Lokai, I don't know what's normal for you exactly,

123
00:07:41,364 --> 00:07:44,663
但如果我有你的读数，那将是有史以来
but if I had your readings, I'd be the most incredible

124
00:07:44,844 --> 00:07:47,210
最令人难以置信的身体样本
physical specimen of all time.

125
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,544
我们从未遇到过像你这样的人
We've never encountered a being like you.

126
00:07:49,616 --> 00:07:52,107
我想更多地了解你和你的星球
I'd like to know more about you and your planet.

127
00:07:52,743 --> 00:07:54,238
我很累
 I'm very tired. 

128
00:07:54,632 --> 00:07:55,656
而且非常不坦率
And very evasive.

129
00:07:55,922 --> 00:07:59,889
 或者至少说不热情，既然，那么…
Or at least not fully responsive. Now, then...

130
00:07:59,889 --> 00:08:01,510
我坚持，我非常疲倦
I insist, I'm extremely tired.

131
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:04,610
因为你的报复性盘问
Made so by your vindictive cross-examinations.

132
00:08:05,932 --> 00:08:07,915
我将不再回答任何问题
I will answer no more questions.

133
00:08:13,306 --> 00:08:14,289
乌乎拉上尉 
Lieutenant Uhura.

134
00:08:14,289 --> 00:08:15,360
[对讲机]我是乌乎拉上尉
[Intercom] Lieutenant Uhura here.

135
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,772
通知星际基地4我们已经找到了穿梭机
Notify Star base 4 that we've recovered its shuttlecraft,

136
00:08:18,845 --> 00:08:22,576
它将与它的…使用者一起返回
and it will be returned along with its user

137
00:08:22,649 --> 00:08:24,776
 一旦我们完成了在阿里安纳斯的任务
as soon as we've completed our mission at Ariannus.

138
00:08:24,851 --> 00:08:27,115
是的长官
Aye, sir.

139
00:08:27,396 --> 00:08:30,418
老骨头，如果你认为突变理论适用
Bones, if you're satisfied that the mutation theory is applicable,

140
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:32,124
我会在我的报告中记录下来
I'll make a note of it in my report.

141
00:08:32,425 --> 00:08:35,137
除非我们从他那里得到更多信息，否则就提交这个
Unless we get more information from him, it'll have to serve.

142
00:08:35,258 --> 00:08:36,634
[对讲机哔哔声]  
[Intercom Beeps] 

143
00:08:38,545 --> 00:08:39,156
我是柯克
Kirk here.

144
00:08:39,156 --> 00:08:41,325
[契科夫]：舰长，与外星飞船接触，长官
[Chekov]: Captain, contact with alien ship, sir.

145
00:08:41,648 --> 00:08:43,588
我马上到，通知史波克先生
I'll be right there. Notify Mr. Spock.

146
00:08:52,826 --> 00:08:54,865
把飞船放在屏幕上，苏鲁先生
Put the ship on the viewing screen, Mr. Sulu.

147
00:08:57,623 --> 00:08:58,765
柯克：放大
Magnification.

148
00:09:02,522 --> 00:09:04,143
依然没有，契科夫先生  
Still nothing, Mr. Chekov. 

149
00:09:04,143 --> 00:09:06,288
我确认了，长官，它在那里
I verify, sir, it's out there.

150
00:09:12,432 --> 00:09:14,764
最大放大倍数
Maximum magnification.

151
00:09:19,675 --> 00:09:21,671
我一无所获，史波克先生，你的回应？
I draw a blank, Mr. Spock. Your response?

152
00:09:21,741 --> 00:09:22,778
 没有，舰长
Negative, Captain.

153
00:09:22,935 --> 00:09:26,530
无故障，长官，读数持续
No malfunction, sir. The reading persists.

154
00:09:32,852 --> 00:09:33,690
怎么了？  
What is it? 

155
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:36,015
那里有一艘船，舰长
There is a vessel out there.

156
00:09:36,089 --> 00:09:39,024
会不会是一艘罗慕伦飞船，使用了隐形装置？
Could it be a Romulan ship using their cloaking device?

157
00:09:39,092 --> 00:09:41,245
不是，它不是罗慕伦船只
Negative. This would not be a Romulan vessel.

158
00:09:41,245 --> 00:09:44,078
它的配置完全不同
It is totally alien in configuration.

159
00:09:44,258 --> 00:09:47,489
动力未知，该船的小尺寸
Motive power unknown. Small size of the craft

160
00:09:47,804 --> 00:09:51,831
表明是一艘快速侦察船，只有一名或两名船员
indicates a rapid scout vessel, one- or two-man crew.

161
00:10:05,218 --> 00:10:09,484
舰长，我试过了所有的呼叫频率，没有，长官
Captain, I've tried all hailing frequencies. Negative, sir.

162
00:10:11,157 --> 00:10:12,437
船上的武器？  
Weaponry on the vessel? 

163
00:10:12,565 --> 00:10:13,757
没有可识别的
Nothing identifiable.

164
00:10:13,894 --> 00:10:16,687
这艘船显然是为速度而不是战斗而建造的
The craft appears to be built for speed rather than combat.

165
00:10:16,763 --> 00:10:18,494
外面的东西看不见
Something out there can't be seen.

166
00:10:19,165 --> 00:10:20,188
 怎么解释？  
Explanation? 

167
00:10:20,188 --> 00:10:22,532
没有，完全难以捉摸
None. Completely elusive.

168
00:10:22,602 --> 00:10:25,935
事实上，它是看不见的
In fact, it's invisible.

169
00:10:26,935 --> 00:10:27,996
看不见的
Invisible.

170
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,676
 故障？
Malfunction?

171
00:10:35,336 --> 00:10:38,712
没有传感器故障，读数持续存在
There is no sensor failure. The readings persist.

172
00:10:43,956 --> 00:10:46,686
它直奔我们而来
It's headed straight for us!

173
00:10:49,128 --> 00:10:51,119
闪避动作
Evasive action.

174
00:10:54,701 --> 00:10:58,137
它跟着我们移动，长官，我们正在推向极限
It shifts with us, sir. And we're pushing to the limit!

175
00:11:00,106 --> 00:11:02,199
激活护盾，苏鲁先生
Deflector shields activated, Mr. Sulu.

176
00:11:02,275 --> 00:11:03,376
自动模式，长官 
Automatic, sir. 

177
00:11:03,376 --> 00:11:04,800
我们在碰撞航线上
We're on a collision course!

178
00:11:04,877 --> 00:11:07,607
它失控了或是自杀任务
It's out of control or a suicide mission.

179
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,046
拉响碰撞警报，红色警报
Sound warning for collision. Red alert!

180
00:11:10,116 --> 00:11:13,875
[警报声]
[Alarms Blaring]

181
00:11:20,193 --> 00:11:22,296
准备迎接碰撞，准备！
Brace yourself for collision! Brace yourself!

182
00:11:36,105 --> 00:11:37,464
读数，史波克先生？
Readout, Mr. Spock.

183
00:11:38,144 --> 00:11:41,973
它只是…解体了
It just disintegrated.

184
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:43,669
真有趣  
Fascinating. 

185
00:11:43,669 --> 00:11:44,846
现在怎么样了？
What is it now?

186
00:11:44,917 --> 00:11:46,316
它现在不见了，舰长
It is gone now, Captain,

187
00:11:46,386 --> 00:11:50,584
但它似乎放下了一个外星人
but it seems to have deposited an alien presence.

188
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:52,582
在哪里？  
Where? 

189
00:11:52,582 --> 00:11:54,011
就在这里，舰长
[Man]Right here, Captain.

190
00:12:02,769 --> 00:12:04,086
解释一下，史波克
Explain, Spock.

191
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,034
独一无二？
One of a kind?

192
00:12:15,982 --> 00:12:18,780
[警报声持续]
[Alarm Continues Blaring]

193
00:12:21,499 --> 00:12:24,517
我是贝尔  - 毫无疑问，属于谢隆星
I am Bele. - Of the planet Cheron no doubt?

194
00:12:24,595 --> 00:12:27,189
原谅我不正式的到达
Forgive my unorthodox arrival.

195
00:12:27,265 --> 00:12:30,564
你的旅行方式也很另类
Your mode of travel was also unorthodox.

196
00:12:30,635 --> 00:12:31,723
解除红色警报
Secure from red alert. 

197
00:12:33,072 --> 00:12:35,072
你的飞船怎么了？
What happened to your vehicle?

198
00:12:35,259 --> 00:12:37,943
它为我服务了很长时间，不幸的是
It served me long and durably. Unfortunately,

199
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:41,542
艰难追逐的劳损已经超过了它的极限
the strain of pursuit has exceeded its qualities.

200
00:12:41,618 --> 00:12:45,782
我刚好能够完成这次旅行并及时下船
I was just able to complete this trip and disembark in time,

201
00:12:45,856 --> 00:12:49,724
否则我会和它一起在太空中解体
or I would have disintegrated in space with it.

202
00:12:49,793 --> 00:12:53,490
一种独特的工艺，可惜我们无法回收来研究
A most unique craft. Pity it couldn't be salvaged for our study.

203
00:12:53,564 --> 00:12:55,896
是的，它被特殊材料包裹着
Yes. It was sheathed in special materials

204
00:12:55,966 --> 00:12:58,059
使其隐形
that rendered it invisible.

205
00:12:58,135 --> 00:13:00,603
是什么让你来找我们？
What brings you to us?

206
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:03,469
你带着宝贵的货物，洛凯
You bear precious cargo, Lokai.

207
00:13:03,959 --> 00:13:06,766
他在这艘船上避难，我是来认领他的
He has taken refuge aboard this ship. I am here to claim him.

208
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:16,746
这艘船上的所有人员都服从我的指挥
All personnel aboard this vessel are subject to my command.

209
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:22,354
没人可以不通过正当程序认领其他人
No one claims anyone without due process.

210
00:13:24,094 --> 00:13:27,757
抱歉，舰长，我越权了
My apologies, Captain. I overstepped my powers.

211
00:13:27,831 --> 00:13:31,323
“认领”无疑是一个不幸的词
Claim is undoubtedly an unfortunate word.

212
00:13:32,137 --> 00:13:34,461
你的授权是什么？哪儿来的授权？
What is your authorization? From what source?

213
00:13:34,538 --> 00:13:37,052
我是政治叛徒委员会的首席官员
I am chief officer of the Commission on Political Traitors.

214
00:13:37,269 --> 00:13:41,501
洛凯被判叛国罪，但逃脱了
Lokai was tried and convicted of treason, but had escaped.

215
00:13:43,208 --> 00:13:45,110
 请问我可以见他吗？
May I see him, please?

216
00:13:45,566 --> 00:13:48,310
他在医务室
He's in Sick Bay.

217
00:13:48,477 --> 00:13:50,319
记住，由于你在企业号上
Remember, since you're aboard the Enterprise,

218
00:13:50,387 --> 00:13:52,651
你受其规定的约束
you're bound by its regulations.

219
00:13:52,939 --> 00:13:55,521
请求你的允许，舰长
Hmm. With your permission, Captain.

220
00:14:00,397 --> 00:14:02,160
史波克先生
Mr. Spock.

221
00:14:19,324 --> 00:14:22,623
好吧，洛凯，很高兴再次见到你
Well, Lokai, it's a pleasure to see you again.

222
00:14:23,077 --> 00:14:25,719
这一次，我相信
This time I'm sure our joining

223
00:14:25,789 --> 00:14:28,781
我们的会面将更久
will be of a more permanent nature.

224
00:14:30,594 --> 00:14:32,365
舰长，恭喜你
Captain, you are to be congratulated.

225
00:14:32,365 --> 00:14:36,653
洛凯从未如此平静过
Never before has Lokai been rendered so...quiescent.

226
00:14:38,068 --> 00:14:41,629
我不会回谢隆，回到屠杀压迫者的土地！
I will not return to Cheron, to a land of murdering oppressors!

227
00:14:41,705 --> 00:14:42,962
我告诉过你要去哪里
I told you where you were going.

228
00:14:43,701 --> 00:14:47,985
我让你的同胞在这里只是出于礼貌
I allowed your fellow countryman here simply as a courtesy.

229
00:14:48,111 --> 00:14:51,728
你会看到这个杀手如何回报你
And you see how this killer repays you,

230
00:14:51,728 --> 00:14:54,359
正如他回报他所有的恩人
as he repays all his benefactors.

231
00:14:54,518 --> 00:14:57,180
恩人？他是个骗子
Benefactors? He's a liar!

232
00:14:57,795 --> 00:15:00,451
他们袭击了我们的家园，将我们从家人身边夺走
He raided our homes, tore us from our families,

233
00:15:00,809 --> 00:15:04,085
把我们赶在一起像牛一样，然后把我们卖为奴隶
herded us together like cattle and then sold us as slaves!

234
00:15:04,161 --> 00:15:05,408
他们是野蛮人，舰长
They were savages, Captain.

235
00:15:05,729 --> 00:15:08,737
我们用心对待他们，视他们为家人，我们教化他们
We took them into our hearts, our homes. We educated them.

236
00:15:08,865 --> 00:15:12,967
是的，只教育如何服务优等种族
Yes! Just education enough to serve the master race.

237
00:15:13,036 --> 00:15:17,700
你是我们爱的产物，你用谋杀来回报我们
You were the product of our love! And you repaid us with murder.

238
00:15:17,774 --> 00:15:20,607
奴隶为什么要对奴隶主仁慈？
Why should a slave show mercy to the enslaver?

239
00:15:20,677 --> 00:15:22,736
奴隶？
Slaves?

240
00:15:22,813 --> 00:15:26,078
几千年前就变了，你重获自由了
That was changed thousands of years ago. You were freed.

241
00:15:26,149 --> 00:15:28,083
自由了！
Freed?

242
00:15:28,908 --> 00:15:30,984
我们可以自由地做人吗？
Were we free to be men?

243
00:15:31,479 --> 00:15:34,217
自由地做丈夫和父亲？
Free to be husbands and fathers?

244
00:15:34,891 --> 00:15:37,826
自由地以平等和有尊严的方式生活？
Free to live our lives in equality and dignity?

245
00:15:37,894 --> 00:15:40,328
是的，前提是你知道如何使用自由
Yes, if you knew how to use your freedom.

246
00:15:40,397 --> 00:15:44,128
你没有足够的自由去屠杀和烧毁所有已经建成的东西！
You weren't free enough to slaughter and to burn all the things that had been built!

247
00:15:44,578 --> 00:15:47,661
我试图打破一亿人的枷锁
I tried to break the chains of 100 million people.

248
00:15:47,927 --> 00:15:51,039
我唯一的罪行是我失败了，为此我认罪
My only crime is that I failed, to that I do plead guilty.

249
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:53,701
事情是有秩序的
There is an order in things.

250
00:15:54,611 --> 00:15:57,963
他要求一天之内建立乌托邦
He asks for utopia in a day.

251
00:15:58,348 --> 00:16:00,282
做不到
It can't be done.

252
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:05,287
不是一天，也不是你想的十万年
Not in a day. And not in ten times 10,000 years by your thinking.

253
00:16:05,355 --> 00:16:08,324
对你来说，我们是一个令人讨厌的永远不完美的种族
To you, we are a breed who will never be ready.

254
00:16:08,392 --> 00:16:11,520
灭绝我们是你们的乌托邦计划
Genocide for my people is the plan for your utopia.

255
00:16:11,595 --> 00:16:14,928
你这个疯狂的、肮脏的、讨厌的堕落阴谋家
You're insane, you filthy little plotter of ruin!

256
00:16:14,998 --> 00:16:19,264
你恶毒地颠覆了每一个善良的思想
You vicious subverter of every decent thought!

257
00:16:19,336 --> 00:16:24,273
你要回来为你的罪行付出代价！
Oh, you're coming back to pay for your crimes!

258
00:16:24,341 --> 00:16:26,502
我认识你和所有那些与你
I know you and all those with whom you're plotting

259
00:16:26,576 --> 00:16:28,510
密谋永久夺权的人
to take power permanently.

260
00:16:28,578 --> 00:16:31,479
当我回谢隆时，你就会明白什么是权力
When I return to Cheron, you will understand what power is.

261
00:16:31,548 --> 00:16:34,312
我将拥有追随者的军队
I will have armies of followers.

262
00:16:35,242 --> 00:16:39,253
先生们，现在很清楚你们彼此非常了解
It's now very clear you know each other extremely well, gentlemen.

263
00:16:41,224 --> 00:16:43,590
这艘船唯一能提供的服务就是把你们聚在一起
The only service this ship can offer is to bring you together.

264
00:16:44,382 --> 00:16:45,491
它不是战场
It is not a battlefield!

265
00:16:45,562 --> 00:16:47,750
舰长，我领导的是革命者，不是罪犯
Captain, I led revolutionaries, not criminals!

266
00:16:47,987 --> 00:16:51,479
我要求政治庇护，这艘船是庇护所
I demand political asylum. This ship is a sanctuary.

267
00:16:51,621 --> 00:16:56,230
我再告诉你一次，对你来说，这艘船就是一座监狱
I'll tell you once more. For you, this ship is a prison.

268
00:16:56,373 --> 00:16:59,103
舰长，你必须
Captain, it is imperative

269
00:16:59,176 --> 00:17:03,579
将洛凯送回谢隆进行审判
that you return Lokai to Cheron for judgment.

270
00:17:04,041 --> 00:17:08,175
专员，谢隆不属于联邦，没有签署任何条约
Commissioner, Cheron is not in the Federation. No treaties have been signed.

271
00:17:08,251 --> 00:17:11,982
你对他的所有权的要求不能得到满足
Your demand for possession of this prisoner cannot be honored.

272
00:17:12,245 --> 00:17:15,354
没有引渡程序允许这样做
There are no extradition procedures to allow it.

273
00:17:15,692 --> 00:17:17,396
清楚了吗，贝尔专员？
Is that clear, Commissioner Bele?

274
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:21,429
队长，我希望你理智点
Captain, I hope you will be sensible.

275
00:17:21,572 --> 00:17:22,656
你是什么意思？  
How do you mean? 

276
00:17:22,656 --> 00:17:23,767
合作
Cooperation.

277
00:17:23,767 --> 00:17:25,315
我不能偏袒任何一方
I cannot take sides.

278
00:17:27,088 --> 00:17:30,464
既然我无船返回谢隆
Since I am without a vessel to return to Cheron,

279
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:33,373
 我坚决要求你立刻带我们去那里
I insist that you take us there immediately.

280
00:17:33,443 --> 00:17:35,274
不可能，我有任务要完成
Impossible. I have a mission to accomplish.

281
00:17:35,345 --> 00:17:37,813
有一个星球需要净化，数以百万计的生命处于危险之中
There's a planet to be decontaminated. Millions of lives are at stake.

282
00:17:38,089 --> 00:17:40,808
完成后，我将返回星际基地4
Once that has been completed, I'll return to Star base 4 and

283
00:17:40,808 --> 00:17:44,384
并把你们俩交给当局，你可以向他们说明情况
and turn you both over to the authorities. You can make your case to them.

284
00:17:46,156 --> 00:17:47,347
对不起，舰长
I am sorry, Captain.

285
00:17:47,485 --> 00:17:53,048
那不令人满意，一点都不令人满意
That will not be satisfactory, not at all satisfactory.

286
00:17:53,483 --> 00:17:57,837
专员，作为来自遥远星球的来访贵宾
Commissioner, as a visiting dignitary from a far planet,

287
00:17:58,335 --> 00:18:01,964
我在这艘船上为你提供一切款待
I offer you every hospitality aboard this ship.

288
00:18:02,682 --> 00:18:04,768
选择任何其他航线
Choose any other course ...

看来你会有双重机会
It seems you'll have a double opportunity

297
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:42,690
在星际基地4上实践你的演讲

309

难以描述，舰长，我正在调查

310
00:19:29,459 --> 00:19:31,984
我不明白，我就是无法控制

323

403，标记7

329
00:20:26,316 --> 00:20:28,944
直奔煤袋星云，如果不停的话

330

飞船的方向控制

336
00:20:45,735 --> 00:20:49,664
重复，飞船偏离航线，失去控制
Repeat, the ship is off course and out of our control.

337
00:20:49,802 --> 00:20:53,465
[警报声继续]

338
00:20:57,839 --> 00:20:59,169
契科夫先生，我们的新航向？

342
00:21:03,887 --> 00:21:08,043
等待航线，坐标现在表明我们正在制定航线到…
Holding pattern. Coordinates now indicate we are charting course to...

343
00:21:08,959 --> 00:21:14,926
舰长，谢隆位于403，标记7和标记9之间
Captain, Cheron lies between 403 mark 7 and mark 9.

344
00:21:17,701 --> 00:21:22,400
我们正在去谢隆的路上，舰长，这艘船现在在我的指挥下
We're on the way to Cheron. Captain, this ship is now under my direction.

345
00:21:26,342 --> 00:21:29,277
你们的5万个地球年里
For 50,000 of your terrestrial years,

346
00:21:29,345 --> 00:21:32,280
我一直在银河系中追寻洛凯
I have been pursuing Lokai through the galaxy.

347
00:21:32,348 --> 00:21:36,250
我跋涉了这么远，这么久，不是为了现在放弃他
I have not travelled this far, this long, only to give him up.

348
00:21:36,319 --> 00:21:39,186
这艘船由我的意志驱动
This ship goes where my will drives it.

349
00:21:39,255 --> 00:21:43,273
舰长，我们现在是曲速10并且在加速
Captain, we are now at warp 10 and the speed is increasing!

350
00:21:45,161 --> 00:21:48,494
舰长，现在航线清晰地直达谢隆
Captain, course is now clearly straight for Cheron

351
00:21:48,565 --> 00:21:51,466
无视一切带我们去阿里安纳斯的企图
despite all efforts to direct us to Ariannus.

352
00:21:51,635 --> 00:21:55,561
我不会回到谢隆，你必须保证我的庇护
I will not return to Cheron! You must guarantee me sanctuary.

353
00:21:55,638 --> 00:21:57,889
他现在帮不了你，你迷失了，洛凯
He cannot help you now. You are lost, Lokai.

354
00:21:57,889 --> 00:22:00,479
你正在走向审判，走向最终惩罚
You're on the way to judgment, to final punishment.

355
00:22:00,844 --> 00:22:01,582
阻止他！
Stop him!

356
00:22:01,582 --> 00:22:05,346
不是这次，你这邪恶的垃圾，不是这次
Not this time. You evil mound of filth. Not this time.

357
00:22:05,415 --> 00:22:09,112
我的事业是正义的，你必须帮助我，你们所有人
My cause is just. You must help me. All of you must help me!

358
00:22:09,185 --> 00:22:11,949
哦，老掉牙的哭喊：可怜，可怜我！
Oh, the old cry: Pity me! Pity me!

359
00:22:12,021 --> 00:22:14,717
他所到之处，都有人帮助他逃脱
Everywhere he's gone, he's been helped to escape.

360
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:17,851
在每个星球上他都找到了为他流血
On every planet he's found fools who bleed for him

361
00:22:17,927 --> 00:22:20,623
为受压迫者流泪的傻瓜
and shed tears for the oppressed one.

362
00:22:20,697 --> 00:22:22,699
但在这艘船上，你无处可逃
But there is no escape for you on this ship.

363
00:22:22,807 --> 00:22:26,067
这是你最后的庇护所
This is your last sanctuary.

364
00:22:26,236 --> 00:22:28,480
杀了他，杀了他！  
Kill him! Kill him! 

365
00:22:28,815 --> 00:22:30,366
你们是两个同类
You're two of a kind.

366
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:32,465
我们都要去谢隆
And we are both going to Cheron.

367
00:22:32,542 --> 00:22:35,670
你不能改变这艘船的航向，就像你不能改变我
You cannot change the course any more than you can change me.

368
00:22:35,979 --> 00:22:38,914
这艘船去我想去的地方！
This ship goes where I want it to go!

369
00:22:39,807 --> 00:22:41,815
警卫，把他们都关禁闭
Security, put them both in the brig.

370
00:22:50,293 --> 00:22:53,751
相位枪调到击晕模式，开火
Phasers on stun. Fire.

371
00:22:53,930 --> 00:22:55,864
[相位枪声]
[Phasers Whistling]

372
00:22:58,301 --> 00:23:01,386
你的相位枪对我们的防护罩无效
Your phasers are ineffective against our shields. 

373
00:23:01,593 --> 00:23:03,830
你帮不上忙，舰长
You are helpless, Captain.

374
00:23:03,907 --> 00:23:08,221
我真是个傻瓜，期待你这样的人的帮助
What a fool I am, expecting help from someone like you!

375
00:23:12,115 --> 00:23:14,466
这艘船要去阿里安纳斯
This ship is going to Ariannus.

376
00:23:14,939 --> 00:23:18,807
不，这艘船要去谢隆
No, this ship is going to Cheron.

377
00:23:19,689 --> 00:23:22,715
我不会让任何事干扰
I will let nothing interfere.

378
00:23:31,801 --> 00:23:34,201
我们要去阿里安纳斯
We are going to Ariannus!

379
00:23:34,201 --> 00:23:36,912
十亿人的生命使它成为我们唯一的选择
The lives of a billion people make no other choice possible.

380
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:41,506
你太愚蠢了，舰长，没有选择
You are being obtuse, Captain. I am permitting no choice.

381
00:23:41,578 --> 00:23:46,880
我的意志现在控制着它，没有什么可以打破它
My will now controls this, and nothing can break it.

382
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:48,041
贝尔  
Bele? 

383
00:23:48,041 --> 00:23:49,007
嗯？
Hmm?

384
00:23:49,419 --> 00:23:51,148
我是这艘船的舰长
I am captain of this ship,

385
00:23:51,221 --> 00:23:53,917
它要遵循我为它设定的航线
and it will follow whatever course I set for it,

386
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:56,305
否则我将下令摧毁它
or I will order its destruction.

387
00:24:01,170 --> 00:24:02,263
你在虚张声势
You're bluffing.

388
00:24:09,375 --> 00:24:13,311
我会毁掉它的
I will destroy it!

389
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:20,513
你不能摧毁这艘船，就像我不能改变肤色一样
You can no more destroy this ship than I can change colour.

390
00:24:23,586 --> 00:24:26,807
 乌乎拉上尉，把舰桥连接到主电脑

00:27:52,142 --> 00:27:53,622
[电脑]15秒…
[Computer] Fifteen seconds...

434
00:27:54,092 --> 00:27:57,530
你可以用你的意志把这艘船拖到谢隆
You can use your will to drag this ship to Cheron.

435
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:02,434
但我指挥电脑，我拥有最终指挥权
But I command the computer. Mine is the final command.

436
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:07,644
[电脑]十、九、八、七、六…
[Computer] Ten, nine, eight, seven, six...

437
00:28:07,644 --> 00:28:08,521
我同意！  
I agree! 

438
00:28:08,521 --> 00:28:09,348
电脑
Computer.

439
00:28:11,604 --> 00:28:14,539
我是联邦星舰企业号的詹姆斯柯克舰长
This is Captain James Kirk of the U.S.S. Enterprise.

440
00:28:15,356 --> 00:28:18,223
连续代码123
Code one, two, three continuity.

441
00:28:20,241 --> 00:28:22,667
中止自毁命令，重复
Abort destruct order. Repeat...

442
00:28:22,743 --> 00:28:27,943
连续代码123
code one, two, three continuity.

443
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:31,684
中止自毁命令
Abort destruct order.

444
00:28:31,752 --> 00:28:34,778
[电脑哔哔声]自毁命令已中止
[Computer Beeping] Destruct order aborted.

445
00:28:34,855 --> 00:28:36,880
自毁命令已中止
Destruct order aborted.

446
00:28:41,461 --> 00:28:44,027
史波克先生，这艘船驶向阿里安纳斯吗？
Mr. Spock, is this ship headed for Ariannus?

447
00:28:44,224 --> 00:28:47,700
不是，舰长，企业号正在一个环形航线中移动
Negative, Captain. The Enterprise is now moving in a circular course.

448
00:28:47,799 --> 00:28:50,488
以曲速10，我们哪儿也去不了
And at warp 10, we're going now here mighty fast.

449
00:28:58,879 --> 00:29:01,712
我警告过你他的背叛，杀了他！
I warned you of his treachery. Kill him!

450
00:29:03,577 --> 00:29:06,187
我们正在等待你履行你的承诺，专员
We're waiting for you to fulfil your commitment, Commissioner.

451
00:29:07,501 --> 00:29:09,457
我很高兴让你完成
Captain, I am happy to have you complete

452
00:29:09,457 --> 00:29:11,555
你的阿里安纳斯的救援任务
your mission of mercy to the planet Ariannus.

453
00:29:12,067 --> 00:29:15,583
干涉这种有价值的事业是愚蠢的
It was madness to interfere with such a worthwhile endeavour.

454
00:29:15,583 --> 00:29:19,779
但如果你愿意，完成后
But, if you will, upon completion, please,

455
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:23,567
请把我和我的叛徒俘虏带到谢隆
take me and my traitorous captive to Cheron.

456
00:29:23,567 --> 00:29:29,490
我没有为控制这艘船做任何交易，先生
I make no deals for control of this ship, sir.

457
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:51,497
航线现在在您的掌控之中
The ship's course is now in your control.

458
00:30:01,116 --> 00:30:02,004
船的航线？
Ship's course?

459
00:30:02,170 --> 00:30:05,044
企业号在前往阿里安纳斯的航线上，舰长
Enterprise is now on course to Ariannus, Captain.

460
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,472
 速度，斯科提？
Speed, Scotty?

461
00:30:10,965 --> 00:30:12,984
曲速6，平稳运行，长官
Warp 6 and smoothly operating, sir.

462
00:30:13,467 --> 00:30:14,885
好的
Good.

463
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:18,332
乌乎拉上尉，解除红色警报  
Lieutenant Uhura, cancel red alert. 

464
00:30:18,332 --> 00:30:18,992
是的，长官
Aye, sir.

465
00:30:18,992 --> 00:30:21,119
让我重申我的立场，先生们
Let me reaffirm my position, gentlemen.

466
00:30:21,218 --> 00:30:24,153
鉴于你们的所作所为，我可以把你们关禁闭，但我不会这样做
I could put you in the brig for what you have done, but I won't do it

467
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:27,983
因为你们对银河系的这一部分不熟悉
because you are new to this part of the galaxy,

468
00:30:28,161 --> 00:30:31,153
它由星际联邦管理
which is governed by the United Federation of Planets.

469
00:30:31,153 --> 00:30:35,522
我们生活在和平中，充分行使个人权利
We live in peace with full exercise of individual rights.

470
00:30:35,633 --> 00:30:39,797
诉诸暴​​力和武力的必要性早已过去
The need to resort to violence and force has long since passed,

471
00:30:39,870 --> 00:30:42,600
在这艘船上不会被容忍
and it will not be tolerated aboard this ship.

472
00:30:42,673 --> 00:30:46,165
你们可以在船上自由移动
You are free to move about the ship.

473
00:30:46,243 --> 00:30:48,559
我希望你们能借此机会
I hope that you'll take the opportunity

474
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:51,048
更多地了解联邦
to know more about the Federation

475
00:30:51,048 --> 00:30:55,010
通过它最好的代表，我的船员
through its best representatives, my crew.

476
00:30:55,386 --> 00:30:56,655
但让我说清楚
But let me make it clear.

477
00:30:57,620 --> 00:31:01,021
我无法容忍干涉这艘船功能的行为
I will stand for no interference with the function of this ship.

478
00:31:02,466 --> 00:31:05,219
全体船员，回到正常工作
All hands, return to normal routine.

479
00:31:05,219 --> 00:31:06,250
通话完毕
Captain out.

480
00:31:16,407 --> 00:31:17,672
你讲得很好，舰长
You speak very well, Captain.

481
00:31:18,155 --> 00:31:20,293
你的话承诺为所有人伸张正义  
-Your words promise justice for all. 

482
00:31:20,293 --> 00:31:21,124
我们尽量，先生
We try, sir.

483
00:31:21,278 --> 00:31:23,356
是，我已经学会了等待行动
Yes, well, I have learned to wait for actions.

484
00:31:23,681 --> 00:31:26,309
阿里安纳斯之后，正义是什么？
After Ariannus, what is justice?

485
00:31:26,484 --> 00:31:29,453
我会等着看它被分配
I shall wait to see it dispensed.

486
00:31:29,876 --> 00:31:32,279
[门打开，关闭]
[Door Opening, Closing]

487
00:31:33,124 --> 00:31:37,993
真有趣，两个不可改变的敌对类人生物
Fascinating. Two irrevocably hostile humanoids.

488
00:31:38,062 --> 00:31:40,121
要我说是令人厌恶
Disgusting is what I call them.

489
00:31:40,197 --> 00:31:43,655
这种描述在科学上并不准确
That description is not scientifically accurate.

490
00:31:43,734 --> 00:31:46,134
史波克先生，“厌恶”这个词
Mr. Spock, the word disgusting

491
00:31:46,203 --> 00:31:49,104
准确地描述了我对这两个人的感受
describes exactly what I feel about those two.

492
00:31:49,505 --> 00:31:50,766
今天闹够了
That's enough for today.

493
00:31:51,575 --> 00:31:53,169
那两个人开始影响你们了
Those two are beginning to affect you.

494
00:32:00,989 --> 00:32:02,384
我从我的行为中知道
And I know from my actions

495
00:32:02,457 --> 00:32:05,119
你们一定都认为我是个火山般鲁莽的人
you must all think me a volcanic hothead,

496
00:32:05,193 --> 00:32:07,855
在危险中喷出熔岩
erupting lava from my nostrils at danger signals

497
00:32:07,929 --> 00:32:10,090
这只是我的想象
that are only figments of my imagination.

498
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:13,965
但请相信我，我的朋友，没有一刻
But believe me, my friends, there can be no moment

499
00:32:14,035 --> 00:32:17,471
我可以放松警惕，只要贝尔在场
when I can have my guard down where such as Bele is present.

500
00:32:17,539 --> 00:32:20,269
那么会发生什么？我扮演疯子
So what happens? I act the madman

501
00:32:20,342 --> 00:32:23,800
发泄他强加于我的愤怒
out of the anger and frustration he forces upon me,

502
00:32:23,879 --> 00:32:26,939
从而证明他的观点，我是一个疯子
and there by prove his point that lam a madman.

503
00:32:27,015 --> 00:32:29,916
没有人知道他在压力下会如何反应，洛凯
[Man]No one knows how he'll react under pressure, Lokai.

504
00:32:29,985 --> 00:32:32,283
[契科夫]毕竟，我们只是人类
[Chekov] After all, we are only human.

505
00:32:32,354 --> 00:32:34,413
[洛凯]哈，契科夫先生
[Lokai] Ah, Mr. Chekov,

506
00:32:34,489 --> 00:32:38,391
这就是我没有能力提醒你和你的船长
therein lies my lack of ability to alert you and your captain

507
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:41,725
像贝尔这样的人的真正威胁
to the real threat of someone like Bele.

508
00:32:41,796 --> 00:32:46,062
你来自地球，在你们的星球上没有迫害
You are from the planet Earth. There is no persecution on your planet.

509
00:32:46,134 --> 00:32:48,329
你怎么能理解我的恐惧
How can you understand my fear,

510
00:32:48,403 --> 00:32:51,395
我的忧虑，我的屈辱，我的苦难？
my apprehension, my degradation, my suffering?

511
00:32:51,473 --> 00:32:53,964
[契科夫]地球上曾经有迫害
[Chekov] There was persecution on Earth once.

512
00:32:54,042 --> 00:32:56,101
我记得在历史课上读到过它
I remember reading about it in my history class.

513
00:32:56,177 --> 00:32:58,839
[苏鲁]是的，但它发生在20世纪
[Sulu] Yes, but it happened way back in the 20th century.

514
00:32:58,914 --> 00:33:00,941
今天没有这种原始的思想
There's no such primitive thinking today.

515
00:33:02,083 --> 00:33:05,452
你在历史上读到过它，我明白了
[Lokai] You have read about it in history, I see.

516
00:33:05,452 --> 00:33:05,951
我怎么能让你的肉体知道
How can I make your flesh know how it feels

517
00:33:05,951 --> 00:33:07,852
我怎么能让你的肉体知道
How can I make your flesh know how it feels

518
00:33:07,923 --> 00:33:09,788
看着所有像你一样的人
to see all those who are like you,

519
00:33:09,858 --> 00:33:12,224
被鄙视，被屠杀
and only because they are like you,

520
00:33:12,563 --> 00:33:15,491
只因为他们和你一样，更糟糕的是
despised, slaughtered, and even worse,

521
00:33:15,563 --> 00:33:19,829
被剥夺作为一个生物的权利，最基本的体面？
denied the simplest bit of decency that is a living being's right?

522
00:33:19,901 --> 00:33:22,734
你知道被拖出家园
Do you know what it would be like to be dragged out of your hovel

523
00:33:22,804 --> 00:33:25,295
卷入另一个星球的战争是什么感觉吗？
into a war on another planet?

524
00:33:25,373 --> 00:33:27,534
一场为你的压迫者服务
A battle that will serve your oppressor

525
00:33:27,609 --> 00:33:30,077
并给你和你的兄弟带来死亡的战斗？
and bring death to you and your brothers.

526
00:33:40,948 --> 00:33:43,646
将它交到星际舰队指挥部手中
Putting the matter into the hands of your Starfleet Command

527
00:33:43,646 --> 00:33:45,092
是正确的程序
is, of course, the proper procedure.

528
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:47,253
我们多久会收到他们的消息，舰长？
How long will it be before we hear from them, Captain?

529
00:33:47,406 --> 00:33:49,806
我希望答案已经在路上了
I expect the answer is already on its way.

530
00:33:49,875 --> 00:33:52,605
那让我们喝到他们对我们问题有明智解决方案吧
Well, then, let us drink to their wise solution to our problem.

531
00:33:52,677 --> 00:33:53,624
我们喝  
Let's do that. 

532
00:33:54,116 --> 00:33:55,475
专员，星际舰队指挥部
Commissioner, Starfleet Command

533
00:33:55,547 --> 00:33:58,311
可能无法达成您预期的解决方案
may not arrive at the solution you anticipate.

534
00:33:58,794 --> 00:34:00,374
还有洛凯挪用的
There is the matter of the shuttlecraft

535
00:34:00,452 --> 00:34:02,613
穿梭机的事情
which Lokai appropriated.

536
00:34:02,687 --> 00:34:04,518
对此的审讯
The interrogation of that matter

537
00:34:04,589 --> 00:34:07,080
对于星际舰队来说可能是最重要的
may be of paramount importance to Starfleet.

538
00:34:08,072 --> 00:34:11,061
先生们，我们正在讨论一个度的问题
Gentlemen, we are discussing a question of degree.

539
00:34:11,129 --> 00:34:14,360
确实，窃取穿梭机和
Surely, stealing a shuttlecraft cannot be equated

540
00:34:14,433 --> 00:34:16,924
谋杀数千人的严重程度不同
with the importance of murdering thousands of people.

541
00:34:17,002 --> 00:34:20,529
我们不知道洛凯有这么做
We do not know that Lokai has done that.

542
00:34:21,378 --> 00:34:23,301
我们一致同意洛凯是个罪犯
One thing we are agreed on is that Lokai is a criminal.

543
00:34:23,375 --> 00:34:24,865
[柯克]不，专员
[Kirk]No, Commissioner.

544
00:34:24,943 --> 00:34:28,410
是洛凯拿了穿梭机，对不起
The one thing we're agreed upon is that Lokai took a shuttlecraft. Excuse me.

545
00:34:28,568 --> 00:34:30,715
[对讲机]乌乎拉呼叫柯克舰长  
[Intercom] Uhura to Captain Kirk. 

546
00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:31,883
我是柯克
Kirk here.

547
00:34:31,950 --> 00:34:33,975
 我收到一条来自星际舰队的信息，长官
I have a communication from Starfleet Command, sir.

548
00:34:34,094 --> 00:34:35,256
好的，读一下  
Yes, read it. 

549
00:34:36,349 --> 00:34:37,157
“星际舰队指挥部
"Starfleet Command

550
00:34:37,157 --> 00:34:40,651
向谢隆的贝尔专员致以问候
"extends greetings to Commissioner Bele of the planet Cheron.

551
00:34:40,725 --> 00:34:43,819
将他与他声称的囚犯运送到他的星球的
"His urgent request to be transported to his planet

552
00:34:43,895 --> 00:34:48,525
紧急要求已纳入考虑
"with the man he claims prisoner has been taken under consideration.

553
00:34:49,094 --> 00:34:52,551
很遗憾我们不能满足这个要求
"It is with great regret that we cannot honour that request.

554
00:34:53,358 --> 00:34:56,007
星际条约规定
"Intergalactic treaty clearly specifies

555
00:34:56,007 --> 00:34:59,340
未经正当程序不得引渡
"that no being can be extradited without due process.

556
00:34:59,411 --> 00:35:01,003
在这种情况下
"In view of the circumstances,

557
00:35:01,079 --> 00:35:03,240
我们毫不怀疑，在星际基地的听证会之后
"we have no doubt that after a hearing at star base,

558
00:35:03,315 --> 00:35:06,241
将允许贝尔专员保留他的囚犯
"Commissioner Bele will be permitted to retain his prisoner

559
00:35:06,241 --> 00:35:08,063
并提供运送…”  
 and will be provided transportation..." 

560
00:35:08,063 --> 00:35:09,564
够了，谢谢你
That's enough. Thank you.

561
00:35:12,124 --> 00:35:16,185
和往常一样，洛凯成功地获得了盟友
As always, Lokaihas managed to gain allies.

562
00:35:16,261 --> 00:35:17,981
等一下，专员
Now, wait a minute, Commissioner...

563
00:35:17,981 --> 00:35:20,286
即使他们不承认自己是这样的的
Even if they don't recognize themselves as being such.

564
00:35:21,379 --> 00:35:26,649
是的，他会再次逃避，延迟，再逃避，在这个过程中
Yes, he will evade, delay, and escape again and in the process

565
00:35:26,649 --> 00:35:30,204
让成千上万无辜的人互相扼杀
put thousands of innocent beings at each other's throats,

566
00:35:30,275 --> 00:35:33,244
让他们为与他们无关的事业而杀人
getting them to kill and maim for a cause which they have no stake in,

567
00:35:33,311 --> 00:35:35,050
但他会扭曲他们的思想
but which he will force them

568
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:37,985
从而迫使他们接受这一点
to violently espouse by twisting their minds

569
00:35:37,985 --> 00:35:41,274
用他的谎言，可恶的指控
with his lies, his loathsome accusations

570
00:35:41,353 --> 00:35:44,269
和卑鄙的威胁
and his foul threats.

571
00:35:44,923 --> 00:35:48,484
专员，我可以向你保证我们的思想
I can assure you, Commissioner, that our minds will not be twisted,

572
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,385
既不会被洛凯，也不会被你扭曲
not by Lokai, nor by you.

573
00:35:51,963 --> 00:35:53,606
对于头脑最简单的人来说
It is obvious to the most simpleminded

574
00:35:53,606 --> 00:35:55,871
洛凯显然属于劣等人种
that Lokai is of an inferior breed.

575
00:35:56,268 --> 00:35:59,101
专员，显而易见的视觉证据是
The obvious visual evidence, Commissioner,

576
00:35:59,171 --> 00:36:02,538
他与你属于同一种族
is that he is of the same breed as yourself.

577
00:36:03,602 --> 00:36:06,475
你瞎了吗，史波克指挥官？看着我
Are you blind, Commander Spock? Well, look at me.

578
00:36:08,970 --> 00:36:09,935
看着我！
Look at me!

579
00:36:11,403 --> 00:36:13,343
你一边是黑色，另一边是白色
You're black on one side and white on the other.

580
00:36:13,973 --> 00:36:16,214
我右边是黑色的
I am black on the right side.

581
00:36:20,779 --> 00:36:23,635
 我没有看到显着差异
I fail to see the significant difference.

582
00:36:23,941 --> 00:36:25,458
洛凯右边是白色的
Lokai is white on the right side.

583
00:36:25,458 --> 00:36:27,557
他们种族右边都是白色的
All of his people are white on the right side.

584
00:36:33,327 --> 00:36:36,637
专员，或许我的母星瓦肯的经历
Commissioner, perhaps the experience of my own planet Vulcan

585
00:36:36,708 --> 00:36:39,700
能为你提供一些有价值的参考
may set an example of some value to you.

586
00:36:39,778 --> 00:36:42,110
瓦肯曾面临的着
Vulcan was in danger of being destroyed

587
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:44,705
同样被摧毁的危险
by the same conditions and characteristics

588
00:36:44,783 --> 00:36:46,910
原因和谢隆一样
which threaten to destroy Cheron.

589
00:36:46,985 --> 00:36:50,751
我们曾经是和你们一样的人，情绪激动
We were once a people like yourselves, wildly emotional,

590
00:36:50,822 --> 00:36:54,155
致力于非理性的对立观点
often committed to irrationally opposing points of view,

591
00:36:54,226 --> 00:36:57,923
当然，导致了死亡和毁灭
leading, of course, to death and destruction.

592
00:36:57,996 --> 00:37:01,329
只有逻辑学科才使我的星球免于灭绝
Only the discipline of logic saved my planet from extinction.

593
00:37:02,549 --> 00:37:05,096
史波克指挥官，我很高兴瓦肯得救了
Commander Spock, I am delighted that Vulcan was saved.

594
00:37:05,170 --> 00:37:07,502
但你不能指望洛凯和他这样的人
But you cannot expect Lokai and people like him

595
00:37:07,572 --> 00:37:09,836
自律行事
to act with self-discipline

596
00:37:09,908 --> 00:37:13,551
就像你期望行星停止绕太阳运行一样
any more than you can expect a planet to stop orbiting its sun.

597
00:37:14,446 --> 00:37:17,040
 让洛凯说出他的不满
Let Lokai state his grievances.

598
00:37:17,115 --> 00:37:18,844
听他讲，听他说
Hear him, listen to him. 

599
00:37:18,917 --> 00:37:20,081
 也许他能改变
Maybe he can change.

600
00:37:20,199 --> 00:37:20,997
也许他想改变他的观念  
Maybe he wants to change. 

601
00:37:20,997 --> 00:37:22,554
他们不会改变
They cannot change.

602
00:37:22,554 --> 00:37:26,197
改变是一切存在的本质过程
Change is the essential process of all existence.

603
00:37:26,524 --> 00:37:30,551
例如，谢隆的人曾经一定有过单色的
For instance, the people of Cheron must have once been mono-coloured.

604
00:37:32,294 --> 00:37:33,962
你是说像你们俩一样？
You mean like both of you?

605
00:37:34,175 --> 00:37:37,126
毫无疑问，在很久以前，一定有一段时间是这样
There must have been a time, long ago, no doubt, when that was true.

606
00:37:37,202 --> 00:37:38,715
[对讲机哨声]  
[Intercom Whistling] 

607
00:37:38,715 --> 00:37:39,385
对不起
Excuse me.

608
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:42,783
我是柯克  
Kirk here. 

609
00:37:42,783 --> 00:37:44,465
[斯科特]我们正在环绕阿里安纳斯
 [Scott] We're orbiting Ariannus.

610
00:37:44,542 --> 00:37:47,773
很好，开始净化程序
Very good. Commence decontamination procedures when ready.

611
00:37:47,846 --> 00:37:49,352
完成时通知我  
Advise when complete. 

612
00:37:49,352 --> 00:37:50,958
马上好，长官，通话完毕
At once, sir. Scott out.

613
00:37:53,385 --> 00:37:55,580
我听说在你们的星球上
I once heard that on some of your planets

614
00:37:55,654 --> 00:37:58,630
人们相信他们是猿的后裔
people believe they are descended from apes.

615
00:38:00,689 --> 00:38:04,724
实际的理论是所有生命形式
The actual theory is that ail life-forms evolved

616
00:38:04,796 --> 00:38:08,253
都是从较低层次进化到更高级的阶段
from the lower levels to the more advanced stages.

617
00:38:11,136 --> 00:38:12,951
准备净化程序  
Ready for decontamination. 

618
00:38:13,197 --> 00:38:14,071
准备好了，长官
Ready, sir.

619
00:38:14,139 --> 00:38:15,009
这里准备好了  
Ready here. 

620
00:38:15,009 --> 00:38:16,198
准备好了，斯科特先生
Ready, Mr. Scott.

621
00:38:16,274 --> 00:38:19,755
苏鲁先生，锁定阿里安纳斯请求的坐标
Mr. Sulu, lock into coordinates requested by Ariannus.

622
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:22,640
已锁定，长官
Locked in, sir.

623
00:38:22,714 --> 00:38:25,479
契科夫先生，为喷雾部署净化槽
Mr. Chekov, position tanks for spray release.

624
00:38:26,621 --> 00:38:27,793
净化槽已就位
Tanks positioned.

625
00:38:28,138 --> 00:38:31,952
乌乎拉上尉，通知阿里安纳斯，任务根据信号开始
Lieutenant Uhura, advise Ariannus the mission is to begin on signal.

626
00:38:32,023 --> 00:38:34,787
必须准备好所有地面预防措施
All ground precautions must be ready.

627
00:38:36,294 --> 00:38:38,251
阿里安纳斯说“开始”
Ariannus says, "go ahead."

628
00:38:40,154 --> 00:38:41,690
好吧，全速前进
Well, let 'er rip.

629
00:39:11,582 --> 00:39:12,883
斯科特呼叫柯克舰长  
Scott to Captain Kirk. 

630
00:39:12,883 --> 00:39:13,957
我是柯克
Kirk here.

631
00:39:14,219 --> 00:39:15,374
 首次运行完成，长官
First run complete, sir.

632
00:39:15,670 --> 00:39:17,535
好的，重复程序以最大化效果
Good. Repeat procedure for maximum effect.

633
00:39:17,535 --> 00:39:18,260
好的，长官
Aye, sir.

634
00:39:19,566 --> 00:39:21,864
准备重复净化程序
Ready to repeat decontamination procedure.

635
00:39:21,963 --> 00:39:23,116
 准备好了，长官
Ready, sir.

636
00:39:23,736 --> 00:39:24,583
苏鲁先生？  
Mr. Sulu? 

637
00:39:24,583 --> 00:39:25,489
我准备好了
Ready here.

638
00:39:41,422 --> 00:39:42,292
我是柯克  
Kirk here. 

639
00:39:42,292 --> 00:39:44,585
我们正在完成最后一圈
We're completing the final orbit.

640
00:39:44,658 --> 00:39:47,559
我正在等待设定航线的指示
I'm awaiting instructions to set course for the next destination.

641
00:39:47,628 --> 00:39:51,724
很好，我们马上就来，设定去星际基地4的方向控制
Very good. We'll be right up. Set directional controls for Star base 4.

642
00:39:52,023 --> 00:39:52,890
通话完毕
Kirk out.

643
00:39:56,437 --> 00:39:58,415
你和我们一起去舰桥吗？
Will you join us on the bridge?

644
00:39:59,006 --> 00:40:00,817
求之不得
There is nothing I would like more.

645
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:08,306
柯克：舰长日志，星历5730.7
Captain's Log : Star date 5730. 7.

646
00:40:08,382 --> 00:40:10,543
我们完成了阿里安纳斯的任务
Having completed our mission to Ariannus,

647
00:40:10,617 --> 00:40:13,142
企业号正飞往星际基地4
the Enterprise is now on course to Star base 4.

648
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:14,881
船员进行正常工作
The crew is on normal routine,

649
00:40:14,955 --> 00:40:17,321
没有发生任何事故
and we are proceeding without incident.

650
00:40:17,391 --> 00:40:19,882
 有麻烦，契科夫先生？
Trouble, Mr. Chekov?

651
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:22,485
我不太清楚，史波克先生
I don't rightly know, Mr. Spock.

652
00:40:22,563 --> 00:40:25,930
我试图按照命令规划前往星际基地4
I was trying to program for Star base 4 as ordered.

653
00:40:25,999 --> 00:40:27,027
我无法得到回应  
I can't get a response. 

654
00:40:27,027 --> 00:40:28,593
它似乎死机了，长官
It just seemed to go dead, sir.

655
00:40:32,188 --> 00:40:35,078
舰长，一些电脑内存库被烧毁了
Captain, some of the memory banks of the computer are burned out.

656
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:36,776
你能确定哪些吗？
Can you determine which ones?

657
00:40:36,844 --> 00:40:39,779
方向控制和自毁，舰长
The directional control and the self-destruct, Captain,

658
00:40:39,847 --> 00:40:41,328
都烧坏了
are both burnt out.

659
00:40:42,115 --> 00:40:43,268
我是这么干的
I did it like this.

660
00:40:49,923 --> 00:40:54,860
[电气噼啪声]
[Electrical Crackling]

661
00:41:12,776 --> 00:41:16,138
柯克：舰长日志，星号5730.6
Captain's Log : Star date 5730. 6.

662
00:41:16,214 --> 00:41:17,977
在一次破坏行为中
In a deliberate act of sabotage,

663
00:41:18,049 --> 00:41:20,108
贝尔专员烧毁了我们的自毁机制
Commissioner Bele has burned out our destruct mechanism

664
00:41:20,185 --> 00:41:23,951
并且用意志再次接管了
and through the power of his will has again taken over

665
00:41:24,022 --> 00:41:26,286
企业号的方向控制
directional control of the Enterprise.

666
00:41:26,456 --> 00:41:30,317
现在我们可以别废话直接去谢隆吗？
Now can we go to Cheron without any more discussion?

667
00:41:33,055 --> 00:41:35,546
目前，我似乎别无选择
At the moment, I seem to have no choice.

668
00:41:35,882 --> 00:41:38,531
所以这就是阿里安纳斯之后的正义
So this is justice after Ariannus!

669
00:41:38,974 --> 00:41:41,269
你签了我的死刑执行令，我警告过你会发生什么
You have signed my death warrant. I warned you what to expect.

670
00:41:42,884 --> 00:41:46,636
你会继续让这种对正义的嘲弄继续下去吗？
Will you continue to let this mockery of justice go on?

671
00:41:47,011 --> 00:41:50,467
如果你是正义的拥护者，请证明这一点！杀了他！
If you are partisans of justice, prove it! Kill him!

672
00:41:50,665 --> 00:41:52,714
[契科夫]我们不是杀手
[Chekov] We are not killers.

673
00:41:53,049 --> 00:41:55,225
你能做什么？只在嘴上伸张正义吗？
What do you do? Carry justice on your tongues?

674
00:41:55,609 --> 00:41:57,619
你只会为它乞求，但你不会为它而战或死
You will beg for it, but you won't fight or die for it.

675
00:41:57,875 --> 00:42:00,958
经过多年的领导战斗，你似乎很有活力
After so many years of leading the fight, you seem very much alive.

676
00:42:01,164 --> 00:42:04,365
我怀疑他的许多追随者也能这样说
I doubt that the same can be said for many of his followers.

677
00:42:04,552 --> 00:42:06,222
你完了，洛凯！
You're finished, Lokai!

678
00:42:06,297 --> 00:42:10,688
我们已经把你的种族关在了谢隆上
We've got your kind penned in on Cheron into little districts.

679
00:42:10,688 --> 00:42:11,725
那不会改变
It's not going to change.

680
00:42:11,803 --> 00:42:15,000
你搜寻了整个银河系，一无所获，除了单色垃圾
You've combed the galaxy and come up with nothing but mono-coloured trash,

681
00:42:15,073 --> 00:42:17,007
行善者和流血的心
do-gooders and bleeding hearts.

682
00:42:17,075 --> 00:42:19,543
你死定了，你这个半白人
You're dead, you half-white!

683
00:42:21,010 --> 00:42:22,695
你这个没用的无聊家伙
You useless pieces of bland flesh.

684
00:42:24,448 --> 00:42:26,875
我要带你走，你个半黑！
I'll take you with me, you half-black.

685
00:42:29,865 --> 00:42:32,130
贝尔，你再这样下去
Bele, you keep this up,

686
00:42:32,130 --> 00:42:33,982
就永远无法和你的囚犯一起去谢隆了
and you'll never get to Cheron with your prisoner.

687
00:42:34,436 --> 00:42:36,522
飞船的舰桥将受到不可挽回的损坏
The rest of this ship will be irreparably damaged.

688
00:42:36,862 --> 00:42:39,126
这将是你们最后的战场
This will be your final battlefield.

689
00:42:39,197 --> 00:42:43,634
你5万年的追寻都白费了
Your 50,000 years of pursuit will have been wasted.

690
00:42:47,205 --> 00:42:52,084
而你，洛凯，将在太空中死去
And you, Lokai, you'll die here in space.

691
00:42:53,011 --> 00:42:57,243
你不会激励更多的信徒，你的事业将结束
You'll inspire no more disciples. Your cause will be ended.

692
00:42:57,316 --> 00:43:01,753
记住，舰长，政治庇护所是我的权利
Remember, Captain, political sanctuary is my right.

693
00:43:02,485 --> 00:43:05,715
我是你的俘虏，尊重这一权利
I am your prisoner. Honour that right,

694
00:43:06,058 --> 00:43:08,822
否则战斗会继续，你的船会被烧毁
or the fight will go on and your ship will burn up.

695
00:43:09,606 --> 00:43:10,623
你说到点子上了
You've made your point.

696
00:43:10,696 --> 00:43:12,492
如果你听他的诡计
If you listen to his legalistic trickery,

697
00:43:12,492 --> 00:43:15,096
我将不得不摧毁这艘船
I shall have to destroy this ship and everybody aboard.

698
00:43:15,693 --> 00:43:16,913
我明白了
I understand.

699
00:43:17,879 --> 00:43:21,437
你会把企业号归还给我吗？
Will you return the Enterprise to my control?

700
00:43:30,555 --> 00:43:31,756
为什么不？
Why not?

701
00:43:44,038 --> 00:43:46,995
斯科提，方向控制维修是否已经完成？
Scotty, have repairs on directional control been completed?

702
00:43:47,065 --> 00:43:49,090
是的，长官，已改道
Aye, sir, rerouted.

703
00:43:49,167 --> 00:43:52,038
检查控制器和坐标
Check controls and coordinates.

704
00:43:52,437 --> 00:43:55,503
[苏鲁]控制器操作中，企业号一如既往地作出响应
[Sulu] Controls operating. The Enterprise is responding.

705
00:43:55,857 --> 00:43:57,039
舰长，真不错  
Captain, it's beautiful. 

706
00:43:57,039 --> 00:43:58,526
锁定坐标
Locking onto coordinates.

707
00:43:58,635 --> 00:44:01,560
舰长，我们在谢隆的扫描范围内
Captain, we are within scanning range of Cheron.

708
00:44:05,183 --> 00:44:06,780
是否在可视范围内？  
Is it within visual range? 

709
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:08,983
现在进入范围内，舰长
Coming within visual range now, Captain.

710
00:44:09,272 --> 00:44:11,318
契科夫，把它放在屏幕上，最大放大倍数
Chekov, put it on the screen, extreme magnification.

711
00:44:17,929 --> 00:44:19,338
你扫描到了什么？  
What are you picking up? 

712
00:44:19,338 --> 00:44:23,458
几个非常大的城市，无人居住
Several large cities, uninhabited.

713
00:44:24,321 --> 00:44:27,857
巨大的交通系统，没有交通
Extensive traffic systems, barren of traffic.

714
00:44:28,907 --> 00:44:33,571
低等动物和植物侵占城市
Lower animal sand vegetation encroaching on the cities.

715
00:44:33,645 --> 00:44:37,445
根本没有智能生命形式显示，舰长
No sapient life-forms registering at all, Captain.

716
00:44:37,814 --> 00:44:40,314
[史波克]没有自然灾害的证据
[Spock] There is no evidence of natural disaster,

717
00:44:40,385 --> 00:44:43,912
然而，还有大量未掩埋的尸体
yet there are vast numbers of unburied corpses in all cities.

718
00:44:44,187 --> 00:44:48,855
你的意思是…所有的人都死了？
You mean, all the people are dead?

719
00:44:50,658 --> 00:44:52,094
都死了，舰长
All dead, Captain.

720
00:44:52,332 --> 00:44:55,607
他们已经彻底消灭了对方
They have annihilated each other totally.

721
00:44:56,912 --> 00:45:00,723
我的人民，都死了？
My people, my... all dead?

722
00:45:01,139 --> 00:45:03,905
是的，专员，所有人
Yes, Commissioner, all of them.

723
00:45:04,949 --> 00:45:06,288
没有一个活着？  
No one alive? 

724
00:45:06,643 --> 00:45:08,402
完全没有，先生
None at all, sir.

725
00:45:09,981 --> 00:45:14,044
是你们这帮凶手干的！
Your band of murderers did this.

726
00:45:14,386 --> 00:45:17,355
是你们的种族灭绝狂做的！
Your insane asylum maniacs did this!

727
00:45:17,422 --> 00:45:19,720
停下来！你们两个怎么了？
Stop it! What's the matter with you two?

728
00:45:19,791 --> 00:45:22,726
你们没听到史波克说的吗？你的星球已经死了
Didn't you hear Spock? Your planet is dead!

729
00:45:23,140 --> 00:45:25,898
因为仇恨谢隆上已经没有活人了
There's nobody alive on Cheron because of hate.

730
00:45:26,598 --> 00:45:29,012
你为之奋斗的目标已不复存在
The cause you fought about no longer exists.

731
00:45:29,901 --> 00:45:32,426
花点时间喘口气，放弃你们的仇恨
Give yourselves time to breathe. Give up your hate.

732
00:45:33,826 --> 00:45:36,702
欢迎你们和我们一起生活
You're welcome to live with us.

733
00:45:37,077 --> 00:45:39,266
听我说
Listen to me.

734
00:45:39,344 --> 00:45:42,513
如果你们不停止仇恨
You both must end up dead

735
00:45:43,173 --> 00:45:45,044
你们俩最后都会死
if you don't stop hating.

736
00:45:45,468 --> 00:45:47,586
你是一个理想主义的梦想家
You're an idealistic dreamer.

737
00:45:52,511 --> 00:45:53,515
贝尔
Bele?

738
00:45:56,449 --> 00:45:58,440
 追捕结束了
The chase is finished.

739
00:45:58,517 --> 00:46:01,111
他逃不出我的手心
He must not escape me.

740
00:46:01,394 --> 00:46:03,280
他能去哪里？
Where can he go?

741
00:46:10,674 --> 00:46:11,332
贝尔？
Bele?

742
00:46:12,169 --> 00:46:14,001
先生，我要通知警卫吗？  
Shall I alert security, sir? 

743
00:46:14,641 --> 00:46:16,207
不，上尉
No, Lieutenant.

744
00:46:17,478 --> 00:46:18,817
他们能跑到哪里去？
Where can they run?

745
00:46:38,062 --> 00:46:41,381
[史波克]舰长，我用船上的传感器上找到了他们
[Spock] Captain, I have located them on ship's sensors.

746
00:46:41,381 --> 00:46:41,623
贝尔在3号甲板上追逐洛凯
Bele is chasing Lokai on deck 3.

747
00:46:41,623 --> 00:46:46,404
贝尔在3号甲板上追逐洛凯
Bele is chasing Lokai on deck 3.

748
00:47:04,895 --> 00:47:07,836
贝尔正在经过3号娱乐室
Bele is passing recreation room 3,

749
00:47:08,043 --> 00:47:09,766
接近船员休息室
approaching the crewmen's lounge.

750
00:47:10,397 --> 00:47:13,391
洛凯跑过船员休息室
Lokai is running past the crewmen's lounge.

751
00:47:28,485 --> 00:47:31,010
洛凯刚刚抵达5号甲板

752
00:47:51,704 --> 00:47:54,028
经过3号娱乐室.
Passing recreation room 3.

753
00:47:59,616 --> 00:48:01,100
[传送装置嗡嗡声]
[Transporter Whirring]

754
00:48:02,152 --> 00:48:04,803
[传送装置嗡嗡声]
[Transporter Humming]

755
00:48:05,660 --> 00:48:08,270
舰长，有人激活了传送装置
Captain, someone has activated the transporter mechanism.

756
00:48:08,684 --> 00:48:10,230
史波克，传送室里有人吗？
Spock, anyone in the transporter room?

757
00:48:10,379 --> 00:48:12,732
没有，舰长，传送室是空的
Negative, Captain. Transporter room is clear.

758
00:48:12,978 --> 00:48:18,228
然而，有一个生命形式正在星球上物质化
However, there is a life-form materializing on the planet.

759
00:48:19,636 --> 00:48:23,970
是洛凯，他回到了谢隆
It is Lokai. He is back on Cheron.

760
00:48:24,364 --> 00:48:27,594
那里没人会审判他，他的法官都死了
There's nobody there to try him. His judges are all dead.

761
00:48:41,629 --> 00:48:44,327
舰长，传送装置再次被激活
Captain, the transporter mechanism has been activated again.

762
00:48:45,874 --> 00:48:46,977
当然  
Of course. 

763
00:48:47,194 --> 00:48:48,514
是贝尔，舰长

764
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:51,888
[传送装置嗡嗡声]
[Transporter Whirring]

765
00:48:52,235 --> 00:48:55,290
[传送装置嗡嗡声]
[Transporter Humming]

766
00:48:58,018 --> 00:49:02,574
而另一个生命形式出现在谢隆上
And another life-form has appeared on Cheron.

767
00:49:09,315 --> 00:49:10,694
这没有任何意义
It doesn't make any sense.

768
00:49:13,442 --> 00:49:18,317
期望从这种极端观点的两种心态中获得理智
To expect sense from two mentalities of such extreme viewpoints

769
00:49:18,809 --> 00:49:20,795
是不合逻辑的
is not logical.

770
00:49:20,864 --> 00:49:23,586
但是他们的星球已经死了，谁是对的重要吗？
But their planet's dead. Does it matter now which one's right?

771
00:49:23,823 --> 00:49:29,062
对洛凯和贝尔来说不是这样，对他们来说重要的是他们的仇恨
Not to Lokai and Bele. All that matters to them is their hate.

772
00:49:29,246 --> 00:49:31,357
你认为这就是他们所拥有的一切吗？
Do you suppose that's all they ever had, sir?

773
00:49:31,875 --> 00:49:36,361
不，但他们只剩下这些了
No. But that's all they have left.

774
00:49:37,572 --> 00:49:43,235
曲速2，苏鲁先生，设定去星际基地4的航线
Warp factor 2, Mr. Sulu. Set course for Star base 4.
