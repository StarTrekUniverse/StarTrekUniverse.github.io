00:00:14,911 --> 00:00:18,039
柯克：舰长日志，星历5121.5
KIRK: Captain's log, stardate 5121.5.

2
00:00:18,331 --> 00:00:21,667
绕着米纳里亚星系的第二颗行星运行
Orbiting the second planet in the Minarian star system.

3
00:00:21,876 --> 00:00:25,129
有证据表明这颗恒星进入了新星爆发阶段
This star has given evidence of entering a nova phase

4
00:00:25,296 --> 00:00:30,468
六个月前，建了一个站点来研究
and six months ago, a station was established to make studies of the star

5
00:00:30,676 --> 00:00:33,137
这颗恒星的最后阶段
as its end approaches.

6
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:38,935
米纳拉正进入临界时期
Minara is now entering a critical period

7
00:00:39,227 --> 00:00:45,024
和企业号被命令来撤离研究站
and the Enterprise has been ordered to evacuate the station.

8
00:00:45,233 --> 00:00:52,156
然而，我们试图联系该站工作人员的尝试并未成功
Yet our attempts to contact the station's personnel have been unsuccessful.

9
00:00:52,323 --> 00:00:58,121
灰尘，显然这些仪器最近没有使用过
Dust. Apparently these instruments have not been recently used.

10
00:00:58,287 --> 00:01:02,750
录音带，也许它会告诉我们一些关于人员的事情[通讯器哔哔声]
Record tape. Maybe it'll tell us something about the personnel that lived here. [Communicator Beeps]

11
00:01:05,569 --> 00:01:07,895
斯科提[通过无线电]：企业号呼叫柯克舰长，请回答
SCOTTY [OVER RADIO]: Enterprise to Captain Kirk. Come in.

12
00:01:08,011 --> 00:01:09,281
我是柯克，怎么了，企业号？
Kirk here. What is it, Enterprise?

13
00:01:09,423 --> 00:01:13,177
我是斯科特，我们的仪器发现了巨大的太阳耀斑
Scott here, sir. Our instruments have picked up a gigantic solar flare

14
00:01:13,344 --> 00:01:16,848
伴随着高强度的宇宙射线
with high levels of cosmic rays accompanying it.

15
00:01:17,014 --> 00:01:19,851
- 有多糟糕？  - 极其巨大
- How bad? - An enormous one.

16
00:01:20,017 --> 00:01:25,231
我们的传感器显示宇宙射线为里特3.51级
Our sensors indicate the cosmic ray measures 3.51 on the Ritter scale.

17
00:01:25,398 --> 00:01:28,317
那对船员和飞船来说都很糟糕
That will play the devil with the crew and ship.

18
00:01:28,484 --> 00:01:32,989
按照这个速度，风暴需要74.1个太阳小时才能过去
At that rate, it will take 74.1 solar hours for the storm to pass.

19
00:01:33,156 --> 00:01:36,784
让船离开这里，保持最小距离
Get the ship out of here. Stay at minimum distance.

20
00:01:36,993 --> 00:01:41,455
- 是的，长官，我们会传送你们上来…  - 不用，我们留在这里，大气层会保护我们
- Aye, aye, sir. We'll beam you up in... - Negative. We're staying here. The atmosphere will protect us.

21
00:01:41,622 --> 00:01:45,293
- 让飞船离开这里  - 那好吧，通话完毕
- Get that ship out of here. - Very well. Scott out.

22
00:01:45,459 --> 00:01:47,503
那盘磁带呢？
What about that tape?

23
00:01:47,712 --> 00:01:52,675
请记住，舰长，我们在此录像带上看到的内容发生在约三个月前
Remember, Captain, what we see on this tape happened three months ago.

24
00:01:52,842 --> 00:01:57,180
我认为我不能在这个被上帝遗忘的地方再坚持一周
I don't think I can stand another week in this godforsaken place.

25
00:02:01,726 --> 00:02:04,854
“地的深处在他手中”
"In His hand are the deep places of the earth."

26
00:02:05,021 --> 00:02:09,275
诗篇第95章，第4段，看起来他在听
Psalm 95, verse 4. Looks like he was listening.

27
00:02:10,776 --> 00:02:13,279
[尖锐的噪音]
[HUMMING]

28
00:02:18,075 --> 00:02:20,203
谁在下面？
Who's down there?

29
00:02:22,288 --> 00:02:24,415
他们发生了什么？
What happened to them?

30
00:02:24,749 --> 00:02:26,834
[尖锐的噪音]
[HUMMING]

31
00:02:29,003 --> 00:02:32,715
那声音是从哪里来的？史波克，你能定位吗？
Where's that sound coming from? Spock, can you pinpoint it?

32
00:02:32,882 --> 00:02:35,843
否定的，舰长，它没有显示
Negative, Captain. It doesn't register.

33
00:02:48,397 --> 00:02:49,899
老骨头
Bones.

34
00:02:52,068 --> 00:02:53,569
史波克！
Spock!

35
00:03:00,284 --> 00:03:02,370
[隆隆声]
[EXPLOSION]

36
00:03:19,303 --> 00:03:22,473
柯克：太空，最后的边界
KIRK: Space, the final frontier.

37
00:03:27,979 --> 00:03:32,149
这些是星舰的航行企业号
These are the voyages of the starship Enterprise.

38
00:03:32,316 --> 00:03:36,696
它的五年使命：探索陌生的新世界
Its five-year mission: To explore strange new worlds,

39
00:03:36,904 --> 00:03:40,324
寻找新生命和新文明
to seek out new life and new civilizations,

40
00:03:40,491 --> 00:03:44,078
勇敢地去以前没有人去过的地方
to boldly go where no man has gone before.

41
00:04:30,958 --> 00:04:33,836
史波克，老骨头
Spock. Bones.

42
00:04:35,629 --> 00:04:38,090
我们在哪？
Where are we?

43
00:04:38,257 --> 00:04:43,387
正好在行星表面以下121.32米，舰长
Exactly 121.32 metres beneath the planet's surface, Captain.

44
00:04:43,554 --> 00:04:48,517
- 我们是怎么到这里来的？  - 被一个物质能量扰频器传送过来的
- How did we get here? - Beamed by a matter-energy scrambler

45
00:04:48,726 --> 00:04:51,270
类似于我们的传送装置
similar to our transporter mechanism.

46
00:04:51,562 --> 00:04:54,148
- 伤口很严重，痛吗？  - 不
- That's a nasty cut. Does it hurt? - No.

47
00:04:54,315 --> 00:04:57,276
测量到一个生命读数，方为42，标记7
Getting a life-form reading, bearing 42, mark 7.

48
00:04:57,485 --> 00:05:02,365
- 失踪的科学家之一？  - 不，类人动物，但绝不是智人
- One of the missing scientists? - No. Humanoid but not homo sapiens.

49
00:05:02,531 --> 00:05:05,201
- 鉴定？  - 不可能
- Identification? - Impossible.

50
00:05:05,409 --> 00:05:08,996
我无法鉴定非类人生物
I can make no identification other than it being humanoid.

51
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:12,583
让我们来弄明白，相位枪击晕模式
Let's find out. Phasers on stun.

52
00:05:24,053 --> 00:05:26,222
接近生命形式，舰长
Approaching the life-form.

53
00:05:26,389 --> 00:05:29,350
- 它是什么？  - 仍然难以辨别
- What is it? - Still undistinguishable.

54
00:05:45,324 --> 00:05:49,578
- 当心  - 为何，她看起来足够无害
- Be careful. - Why? She seems harmless enough.

55
00:05:49,745 --> 00:05:53,833
马纳克四号的沙蝙蝠似乎是无生命的水晶，医生
The sand bats of Manark IV appear to be inanimate rock crystals, Doctor...

56
00:05:53,999 --> 00:05:56,127
直到他们进攻
until they attack.

57
00:06:09,306 --> 00:06:11,392
我们不会伤害你
We're not gonna hurt you.

58
00:06:14,478 --> 00:06:18,107
这是你的家吗？你住在这里吗？
Is this your home? Do you live here?

59
00:06:21,318 --> 00:06:23,320
怎么样，史波克？分析
What about it? Analysis.

60
00:06:23,654 --> 00:06:28,242
根据我们对这个星球的重力和其他因素的了解
From what we know of the gravity and other factors of this planet,

61
00:06:28,492 --> 00:06:32,329
像她这样的生命体无法在这里进化
life-forms such as hers could not evolve here.

62
00:06:42,506 --> 00:06:45,759
你负责把我们带到这里吗？
Are you responsible for bringing us here?

63
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:51,182
不要害怕，老骨头，她怎么了？
Don't be afraid. Bones, what's wrong with her?

64
00:06:59,857 --> 00:07:03,861
她是个哑巴，吉姆，没有声带
She's a mute. No vocal chords.

65
00:07:04,028 --> 00:07:08,199
甚至没有退化迹象，而且我不认为这是一种病理状态
Not even vestigials. And I don't think it's a pathological condition.

66
00:07:08,532 --> 00:07:11,160
- 解释  - 她看起来很健康
- Explain. - She appears to be healthy.

67
00:07:11,368 --> 00:07:17,917
换句话说，缺少声带是她这个人种的正常生理结构
Lack of vocal chords could be normal for her species, whatever that is.

68
00:07:18,167 --> 00:07:22,713
一个哑巴种族，类似伽马维迪斯四号上的文明
A race of mutes. Like the civilization on Gamma Vertis IV.

69
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,716
这就是我的观察，不管对不对
That's my observation, for what it's worth.

70
00:07:25,883 --> 00:07:30,054
没有语言，她怎么能理解我们的意思呢？
Without speech, how's she going to be able to understand us?

71
00:07:30,221 --> 00:07:34,141
- 除非她是心灵感应者  - 一种不太可能的可能性，舰长
- Unless she's a telepath. - An unlikely possibility.

72
00:07:34,308 --> 00:07:39,688
因为98%的心灵感应物种发送思想并且接收思想
Since 98% of the telepathic species send thoughts as well as receive them.

73
00:07:39,939 --> 00:07:43,234
她没有试图接触我们的思想
She's made no attempt to contact our minds.

74
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:47,613
我们不能一直称她为“她”，就好像她不在这里一样
We can't keep referring to her as "she" as if she weren't here.

75
00:07:49,073 --> 00:07:51,116
你有何高见？
Do you have any idea?

76
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:55,079
我不知道你们，但我要叫她宝石
I don't know about you but I'm gonna call her Gem.

77
00:07:55,287 --> 00:07:59,458
- 宝石，医生？  - 嗯，总比“嘿，你”要好
- Gem, Doctor? - That's better than "Hey, you".

78
00:08:00,834 --> 00:08:04,463
我想知道我们为什么在这里
I want to know why we're here.

79
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:06,715
我想知道这是怎么回事
I want to know what's going on.

80
00:08:08,801 --> 00:08:11,095
而她知道
And she knows.

81
00:08:22,314 --> 00:08:26,610
- 我是舰长  - 我们知道你的身份，舰长
- I'm Captain... - We are aware of your identity.

82
00:08:26,777 --> 00:08:30,739
你们是谁？你们为什么带我们来这里？
Who are you? Why did you bring us here?

83
00:08:30,948 --> 00:08:34,034
我们是维恩人，不要插手
We are Vians. Do not interfere.

84
00:08:38,455 --> 00:08:42,334
- 你打算对我们做什么？  - 不要再耽误我们了
- What do you intend to do with us? - Delay us no longer.

85
00:08:42,543 --> 00:08:44,169
我们来…
We come...

86
00:08:59,184 --> 00:09:04,982
既然你已经知道我们是谁，你也一定知道我们是和平而来的
Since you already know who we are, you must also know we come in peace.

87
00:09:06,525 --> 00:09:10,988
我们的首要指令明确禁止我们干涉…
Our Prime Directive specifically prohibits us from interference...

88
00:09:37,348 --> 00:09:40,517
我好像站不起来了
I can't seem to stand up.

89
00:09:40,684 --> 00:09:43,520
不要对抗力场
Don't fight the force field.

90
00:09:43,729 --> 00:09:48,692
有一些东西会扰乱身体的新陈代谢
There's something about it that upsets the body metabolism.

91
00:09:48,859 --> 00:09:54,114
不完全是，医生，场从你的身体中汲取能量
Not quite, Doctor. The field draws its energy from your bodies.

92
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:59,453
你越抵抗，力场就越强
The more you resist, the stronger the force field becomes.

93
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:06,543
哈，足够了
Sufficient.

94
00:10:17,221 --> 00:10:19,264
史波克
Spock.

95
00:10:20,391 --> 00:10:24,061
除了我们刚才看到的那个出口之外，肯定还有一个出口
There must be an exit other than the one we just saw.

96
00:10:24,228 --> 00:10:26,230
正确，舰长
Correct, Captain.

97
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:32,236
- 你感觉还好吗？  - 别担心我
- Do you feel all right? - Don't worry about me.

98
00:10:32,403 --> 00:10:34,571
他们可能伤害了她
They may have hurt her.

99
00:10:42,162 --> 00:10:44,373
他们伤害了你吗？
Did they hurt you?

100
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,839
疼痛消失了
The pain is gone.

101
00:11:34,047 --> 00:11:37,676
她摸了摸我的头，疼痛消失了
She touched my head and the pain is gone.

102
00:11:37,843 --> 00:11:40,304
伤口已经完全愈合
The wound is completely healed.

103
00:11:40,637 --> 00:11:43,974
痊愈了，吉姆，她一定是个同理心
It fits, Jim. She must be an empath.

104
00:11:49,646 --> 00:11:56,528
她的神经系统非常敏感，她能感觉到我们的情绪和生理反应
Her nervous system is so sensitive she can feel our emotional reactions.

105
00:11:56,695 --> 00:11:59,656
- 它们成为她的一部分  - 谢谢
- They become part of her. - Thank you.

106
00:11:59,823 --> 00:12:04,995
舰长，在那个方向上，我的三录仪读取到大量的物体
Captain, in that direction, my tricorder is picking up a substantial collection of objects.

107
00:12:05,162 --> 00:12:07,831
- 详细说？  - 电子设备
- Details? - Electronic devices.

108
00:12:07,998 --> 00:12:12,544
我不明白为什么我的三录仪之前没有给出任何指示
I fail to understand why my tricorder previously gave no indication of them.

109
00:12:12,711 --> 00:12:15,506
他们在那里，让我们检查一下
They're there now. Let's check them out.

110
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:20,344
一个人呆在这里可能很危险，跟我们来
Staying here alone could be dangerous. Come with us.

111
00:12:59,633 --> 00:13:01,718
真有趣
Fascinating.

112
00:13:02,052 --> 00:13:04,263
看看这东西
Look at this stuff.

113
00:13:21,572 --> 00:13:25,033
老骨头，史波克，过来
Bones, Spock, come here.

114
00:13:48,056 --> 00:13:50,267
吉姆，史波克
Jim, Spock.

115
00:14:10,287 --> 00:14:15,959
你们按时到了，一些进一步的简单测试是必要的
We are on schedule. Some further simple tests are necessary.

116
00:14:16,126 --> 00:14:21,632
- 我们已经看到了你们的一些测试结果  - 我找到了我们失踪的人，死了
- We've seen the results of your tests. - I found our missing men. Dead.

117
00:14:21,798 --> 00:14:26,470
- 你的另一个实验？  - 你错了，他们自己的不完美杀死了他们
- Another one of your experiments? - You're wrong. Their own imperfections killed them.

118
00:14:26,637 --> 00:14:30,641
他们不是合适的主题，来
They were not fit subjects. Come.

119
00:14:30,807 --> 00:14:34,561
- 时间不多了  - 是的，你的时间不多了
- Time is short. - Yes. Your time is running out.

120
00:14:34,728 --> 00:14:40,484
太阳即将新星爆发，当它发生时，它会摧毁你们，这个星球和这个疯狂的刑讯室
The sun is about to nova. When it does, it'll destroy you, this planet,  it will destroy this torture chamber.

121
00:14:45,197 --> 00:14:48,158
我们离开这里吧
Let's get out of here.

122
00:14:48,325 --> 00:14:52,746
读数表明通向地表的通道位于这个方向
Readings indicate the passage to the surface lies in this direction.

123
00:15:20,732 --> 00:15:22,818
[风啸]
[WIND HOWLS]

124
00:15:28,991 --> 00:15:32,869
柯克呼叫企业号，柯克呼叫企业号，请回答
Kirk to Enterprise. Kirk to Enterprise. Come in.

125
00:15:34,329 --> 00:15:37,207
超出范围，史波克先生，读数？
Out of range. Readings, Mr. Spock?

126
00:15:37,374 --> 00:15:40,544
研究站在那个方向6公里
Research station 6km in that direction.

127
00:15:40,711 --> 00:15:44,715
我们快过去，如果企业号派了搜查队，一定在那里
Let's get there. If there's a search party, it'll be there.

128
00:16:04,568 --> 00:16:06,361
史波克？
Spock?

129
00:16:08,155 --> 00:16:10,240
还有多远？
Much further?

130
00:16:10,407 --> 00:16:12,242
就在前面
Just ahead.

131
00:16:12,409 --> 00:16:15,787
嘿，吉姆，看，斯科提和搜查队
Hey, Jim, look. Scotty and the search party.

132
00:16:17,205 --> 00:16:18,373
斯科提！斯科提！
Scotty!

133
00:16:18,582 --> 00:16:20,250
呆着那儿！
Stay there!

134
00:16:20,417 --> 00:16:22,794
- 快来  - 我们来了！
- Come on. - We're coming!

135
00:16:32,929 --> 00:16:34,514
继续前进
Keep going.

136
00:16:47,944 --> 00:16:51,114
他们的生存意志是伟大的
Their will to survive is great.

137
00:16:54,868 --> 00:16:59,456
- 他们非常热爱生活，因此而奋斗  - 首要因素
- They love life greatly to struggle so. - The prime ingredient.

138
00:17:05,087 --> 00:17:07,130
他们去哪儿了？
Where did they go?

139
00:17:07,297 --> 00:17:11,384
我想他们从来没有真正出现过，那是海市蜃楼
I believe they were never actually present. It was a mirage.

140
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,725
柯克在哪里？
Where's Kirk?

141
00:17:59,391 --> 00:18:00,475
吉姆
Jim.

142
00:18:00,684 --> 00:18:03,436
你在这里做什么？斯科提在哪里？
What are you doing here? Where's Scotty?

143
00:18:03,645 --> 00:18:06,398
- 舰长，那是海市蜃楼  - 柯克舰长？
- It was a mirage. - Captain Kirk?

144
00:18:06,606 --> 00:18:09,985
我们已经决定一个样本就足够了
We have decided that one specimen will be sufficient.

145
00:18:10,152 --> 00:18:13,029
- 你和我们一起来  - 其他人呢？
- You will come with us. - What about the others?

146
00:18:13,196 --> 00:18:16,283
我们对他们没有兴趣，他们可以走了
We have no interest in them. They may go.

147
00:18:19,161 --> 00:18:23,456
- 很好  - 你不能回去，你会像那两个人一样
- Very well. - You can't go back. You'll end up like the other two.

148
00:18:23,623 --> 00:18:26,543
- 舰长，我请求许可…  - 拒绝
- Captain, I request permission... - Denied.

149
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:28,628
但是，舰长…
But, Captain...

150
00:18:31,715 --> 00:18:34,009
你接到命令了
You have your orders.

151
00:18:44,227 --> 00:18:46,646
- 我的人怎么了？  - 他们很安全
- What happened to my men? - They are safe.

152
00:18:46,813 --> 00:18:50,567
你说的一个标本，我的人怎么了？
One specimen, you said. What happened to my men?

153
00:18:50,734 --> 00:18:55,071
- 的确，首要因素  - 他们在哪？告诉我！
- Indeed. Prime ingredient. - Where are they? Tell me!

154
00:18:57,866 --> 00:19:00,535
你说你会让他们走
You said you'd let them go.

155
00:19:02,913 --> 00:19:04,581
苏鲁先生
Mr. Sulu.

156
00:19:04,748 --> 00:19:09,586
你能估计一下太阳耀斑还要多久才减弱吗？
Estimate how much longer we'll have until the solar flares subside.

157
00:19:09,753 --> 00:19:11,755
好的，长官
Aye, sir.

158
00:19:12,672 --> 00:19:17,010
读数现在显示里特2.721级
Readings now indicate 2.721 on the Ritter scale.

159
00:19:17,177 --> 00:19:19,846
按照目前的消减速度
At the present rate of decrease,

160
00:19:20,013 --> 00:19:25,018
我们必须等待17个小时才能尝试进入轨道
we'll have to wait 17 hours before we even attempt to enter orbit.

161
00:19:25,185 --> 00:19:26,227
是的
Aye.

162
00:19:27,687 --> 00:19:31,399
好吧，既然我们被困在这里
Well, as long as we're stuck out here,

163
00:19:31,608 --> 00:19:35,070
我们不妨放松一下，直到暴风雨过去
we might as well relax until the storm passes.

164
00:19:35,278 --> 00:19:39,699
风暴持续的时间比我们预期的要长四个小时
Storm's already lasted four hours longer than we'd anticipated.

165
00:19:41,534 --> 00:19:45,622
- 我们的登陆小队会不会有危险？  - 那不太可能
- Could our landing party be in danger? - That's not likely.

166
00:19:45,789 --> 00:19:48,750
这颗行星的大气层将提供保护
The planet's atmosphere will give protection.

167
00:19:48,959 --> 00:19:53,505
如果我了解柯克舰长，他担心我们更甚于我们担心他，哈
If I know Captain Kirk, he'll be more worried about us than we are about him.

168
00:20:04,766 --> 00:20:09,062
- 你想知道什么？  - 我们不寻求你所说的信息
- What is it you want to know? - We seek no information as you mean.

169
00:20:09,229 --> 00:20:13,483
你们的文明太不成熟，对我们来说没有有价值的知识
Your civilization is too immature to have knowledge of value to us.

170
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:18,405
你不需要我们提供任何知识，但你愿意为此进行杀戮
You don't need any knowledge from us yet you're willing to kill for it.

171
00:20:18,571 --> 00:20:22,325
那就是林克和小坂的遭遇吗？
Is that what happened to Linke and Ozaba?

172
00:20:22,492 --> 00:20:25,787
我们没有杀死他们，他们自己的恐惧杀死了他们
We did not kill them. Their own fears killed them.

173
00:20:25,954 --> 00:20:30,834
那么，你对他们有什么期望？你想从我这里得到什么？
What did you expect from them? And what do you want from me?

174
00:20:31,084 --> 00:20:34,337
我们观察了你激情的强度
We've observed the intensity of your passions,

175
00:20:34,546 --> 00:20:37,507
并衡量了你爱他人的能力
and gauged your capacity to love others.

176
00:20:37,674 --> 00:20:42,470
现在我们希望你向我们展示你的勇气和意志的力量
Now we want you to reveal to us your courage and strength of will.

177
00:20:42,637 --> 00:20:44,639
为什么？
Why?

178
00:20:44,848 --> 00:20:48,601
你希望证明什么？
What is it you hope to prove?

179
00:20:48,768 --> 00:20:52,355
如果我的死有任何意义
If my death is to have any meaning,

180
00:20:52,647 --> 00:20:54,858
至少告诉我我为什么而死
at least tell me what I'm dying for.

181
00:20:55,025 --> 00:20:58,069
如果你活着，你会得到答案的
If you live, you will have your answer.

182
00:21:07,537 --> 00:21:09,039
[呐喊]
[SHOUTS]

183
00:21:29,559 --> 00:21:34,147
过来，史波克，这条通道之前在那里，它一定在那里
Come on. Spock, The passageway was there before. It's gotta be there.

184
00:21:34,314 --> 00:21:39,319
我无法锁定以前的读数，我找不到离开这里的出口
I'm unable to lock in on the previous readings. I can find no exit out of here.

185
00:21:41,362 --> 00:21:43,114
舰长！
Captain!

186
00:21:46,326 --> 00:21:49,412
吉姆，怎么了？他们对你做了什么？
Jim, what is it? What have they done to you?

187
00:22:04,719 --> 00:22:07,430
帮助他，不要害怕帮助他
Help him. Don't be afraid to help him.

188
00:23:56,539 --> 00:23:57,874
吉姆…
Jim...

189
00:23:58,041 --> 00:24:00,752
你躺着别动，我马上去检查她
You lie still. I'll check her out right away.

190
00:24:12,805 --> 00:24:15,808
- 她会活下来吗？  - 她现在看起来很好
- Will she live? - She seems fine now.

191
00:24:16,976 --> 00:24:19,395
你能解释一下发生了什么吗？
Can you explain what happened?

192
00:24:19,646 --> 00:24:23,024
完全的移情作用，她一定是个完全功能性移情者
Complete empathy. She must be a totally functional empath.

193
00:24:23,191 --> 00:24:27,904
她的神经系统与你的神经系统相连，以抵消你最坏的症状
Her nervous system connected to yours to counteract the worst of your symptoms.

194
00:24:28,196 --> 00:24:32,700
她实际上用她的力维持着你身体的生理反应
With her strength, she sustained your body's physiological reactions.

195
00:24:32,867 --> 00:24:36,829
她变虚弱了，我能感觉到，她有生命危险吗？
She weakened. I could feel it. Is her life in danger?

196
00:24:36,996 --> 00:24:42,210
还很难说，但为你的身体提供生命支持确实耗尽了她
It's hard to say yet, but supplying your body with life did drain her.

197
00:24:42,377 --> 00:24:46,047
她退缩似乎暗示了对死亡的恐惧，医生
Her withdrawal suggested the fear of death, Doctor.

198
00:24:46,214 --> 00:24:48,716
只是你催促了，她才继续
Only your urging caused her to continue.

199
00:24:48,925 --> 00:24:51,511
的确，恐惧自然是她的第一反应
That's true. Fear would be a first reaction.

200
00:24:51,678 --> 00:24:56,599
也许她对我们的舰长不够了解，无法为他献出生命
Perhaps she doesn't know our captain well enough to offer her life for him.

201
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,686
这样的损耗会杀死她吗？
Could the strain have killed her?

202
00:24:59,852 --> 00:25:04,691
是的，但我认为她的自我保护本能会插手阻止
I would assume that her instinct for self-preservation would take over to prevent it.

203
00:25:04,857 --> 00:25:07,902
你感觉怎么样？
How do you feel?

204
00:25:09,278 --> 00:25:12,407
我累了
I'm... tired.

205
00:25:12,573 --> 00:25:15,243
你能回忆起发生了什么吗，舰长？
Can you recall what happened, Captain?

206
00:25:15,410 --> 00:25:21,958
我记得实验室，而且…他们想知道一些事情
I remember the laboratory and... they wanted to know something.

207
00:25:23,626 --> 00:25:27,755
- 我不记得了  - 放松
- I can't remember. - Take it easy.

208
00:25:27,964 --> 00:25:31,592
- 我怎么了？  - 你有减压病的症状
- What's the matter with me? - You have symptoms of the bends.

209
00:25:31,759 --> 00:25:35,388
血液中的氮气气泡会导致疼痛
Nitrogen bubbles in your blood cause the pain.

210
00:25:35,596 --> 00:25:40,101
- 但是你怎么会在这儿得减压病？  - 你得去问维恩人
- How do you get the bends down here? - You'll have to ask the Vians.

211
00:25:42,395 --> 00:25:46,441
- 我会活下来吗？  - 你需要在减压室里呆一会儿
- Will I live? - Well, you could use some time in a decompression chamber.

212
00:25:46,607 --> 00:25:49,652
否则，我会说你的康复是奇迹
Otherwise I'd say your recovery is miraculous.

213
00:25:49,861 --> 00:25:53,990
我希望是我的功劳，可惜是她干的
I wish I could take the credit but she did the work.

214
00:25:54,157 --> 00:26:00,288
舰长，我注意到当你从维恩人的实验室回来时，有一束光在你前面
Captain, I noted that a light preceded you when you returned from the Vians' laboratory.

215
00:26:00,455 --> 00:26:04,000
- 为什么你这么喜欢分析？  - 他是对的，继续
- Why are you getting analytical? - He's right. Continue.

216
00:26:04,167 --> 00:26:09,338
我推断这种光是将设备连接到能源的能量传输点
Such a light is an energy transfer point linking this device to the power source.

217
00:26:09,505 --> 00:26:11,674
你能利用它吗？
Can you tap into it?

218
00:26:11,841 --> 00:26:16,679
如果我确定它使用的频率，我也许能让它为我们工作
If I determine the frequency it uses, I can cause it to function for us.

219
00:26:16,888 --> 00:26:19,849
并按照他们带我们进来的方式带我们出去
And get us out the way they brought us in.

220
00:26:20,016 --> 00:26:22,894
- 我也这样认为  - 继续研究
- I would say so. - I would say proceed.

221
00:26:25,772 --> 00:26:28,941
你被称为舰长
You are called Captain.

222
00:26:29,275 --> 00:26:32,528
你对你的船员负责，对吗？
You are responsible for your crew. Is this correct?

223
00:26:32,695 --> 00:26:38,659
- 是的  - 我们的工作需要你的一个手下的合作
- It is. - We find it necessary to have the cooperation of one of your men in our efforts.

224
00:26:38,826 --> 00:26:43,372
- 我们不会合作  - 当我们继续我们的审讯时
- We will not cooperate. - When we resume our interrogations,

225
00:26:43,539 --> 00:26:47,168
你会决堤个我们将用你的哪个手下
you will decide which of your men we shall use.

226
00:26:47,335 --> 00:26:52,215
重要的是，医生有87%的死亡几率
It is essential. There is an 87% chance that the doctor will die.

227
00:26:53,216 --> 00:26:58,721
虽然史波克的生命没有危险，但有93%的几率
And while Spock's life is not in danger, the possibility is 93%

228
00:26:58,888 --> 00:27:04,685
遭受脑损伤，导致永久性精神失常
that he will suffer brain damage resulting in permanent insanity.

229
00:27:18,491 --> 00:27:21,911
- 怎么样了，史波克？  - 我不知道，舰长
- How's it going? - I do not know.

230
00:27:22,078 --> 00:27:25,665
我了解它的运行原理，但仅此而已
I understand its operating principles but that is all.

231
00:27:25,832 --> 00:27:30,169
用不了多久，维恩人就会回来，尽快了解它是如何工作的
It won't be long before the Vians come back. Find out how it works. Soon.

232
00:27:30,336 --> 00:27:31,921
别紧张
Take it easy.

233
00:27:32,088 --> 00:27:35,383
人并不打算生活在这么深的地下，不自然
Men can't live underground. It's not natural.

234
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:37,844
太空旅行自然吗？
And space travel is?

235
00:27:38,010 --> 00:27:41,722
有些人在地面以下的矿井中度过一生
Some men spend their lives in mines beneath the surface.

236
00:27:41,889 --> 00:27:45,268
我是医生，不是煤矿工人
I'm a doctor, not a coal miner.

237
00:27:45,434 --> 00:27:48,938
医生，我已经在三录仪上记录了我的原理和理论
I've recorded my principles and theories.

238
00:27:49,105 --> 00:27:54,193
如果维恩人回来，有足够的数据供你何舰长完成调整
Should the Vians return, there's sufficient data for you and the captain to complete the adjustments.

239
00:27:54,402 --> 00:27:58,781
我不是机械师，不管你留下了多少笔记，我都没法让它工作
I'm not a mechanic. I couldn't get that to work however many notes you left.

240
00:27:58,990 --> 00:28:03,369
可能不是，但是你和舰长一起就能做到
Possibly not. But you and the captain together will be able to do so.

241
00:28:03,536 --> 00:28:07,790
无论如何，你是合乎逻辑的与舰长一起离开的人
In any case, you are the logical one to leave with the captain.

242
00:28:07,999 --> 00:28:10,042
决定权在我
The decision is mine.

243
00:28:12,128 --> 00:28:15,715
如果要做任何决定，我来做…
If there are any decisions to be made, I'll make them...

244
00:28:17,592 --> 00:28:20,761
如果有必要
if and when it becomes necessary.

245
00:28:36,402 --> 00:28:40,031
- 我不需要任何…  - 我仍然是首席医疗官
- I don't need any... - I'm still chief medical officer.

246
00:28:40,239 --> 00:28:44,619
我会告诉你你需要什么，什么时候，你宁愿得减压病吗？
I'll tell you what you need and when. Would you rather have the bends?

247
00:28:44,785 --> 00:28:48,497
就这样，只是躺下来放松一下
That's it. Just lie down and relax.

248
00:28:48,664 --> 00:28:51,250
他要睡多久，医生？
How long will he be asleep, Doctor?

249
00:28:53,294 --> 00:28:57,924
在情绪紧张和减压病发作之间，他的状态很糟糕
Between the emotional strain and that attack of bends, he's in bad shape.

250
00:28:58,090 --> 00:29:01,302
我不是在批评你的行为，相反
I'm not criticising your action. On the contrary.

251
00:29:01,469 --> 00:29:07,308
我很感激它，他将免于做出如此艰难的决定所带来的压力
I'm grateful for it. He will be spared the strain of making so difficult a decision.

252
00:29:07,516 --> 00:29:11,687
- 你大大简化了情况  - 如何？
- You simplify the situation considerably. - How?

253
00:29:11,854 --> 00:29:15,024
当舰长睡着后，我负责指挥
While the captain is asleep, I am in command.

254
00:29:15,191 --> 00:29:18,277
当维恩人回来时，我就跟他们一起去
When the Vians return, I shall go with them.

255
00:29:19,028 --> 00:29:23,950
- 如果我没有给他那一针…  - 选择权会是他的
- If I hadn't given him that shot... - The choice would have been his.

256
00:29:24,116 --> 00:29:26,202
现在它是我的了
Now it is mine.

257
00:30:27,096 --> 00:30:29,724
你的行为是非常不道德的
Your action is highly unethical.

258
00:30:29,890 --> 00:30:32,601
我的决定…成立
My decision... stands.

259
00:30:32,768 --> 00:30:35,354
嗯…嗯…
Um... Um...

260
00:30:40,234 --> 00:30:42,403
不是这次，史波克
Not this time, Spock.

261
00:30:43,904 --> 00:30:45,906
选择已经做好了
The choice has been made.

262
00:30:47,950 --> 00:30:51,704
和我的朋友一起呆在这里，他们会照顾你的
Stay here with my friends. They'll take care of you.

263
00:30:53,873 --> 00:30:56,292
你明白吗？
Do you understand?

264
00:31:00,254 --> 00:31:01,964
那就来吧
Come, then.

265
00:31:26,614 --> 00:31:28,282
医生
Doctor.

266
00:31:28,449 --> 00:31:31,911
如果有任何其他方法可以实现我们的目的…
If there was any other way to accomplish our purpose...

267
00:31:38,084 --> 00:31:40,961
那就做吧
Get on with it.

268
00:31:52,848 --> 00:31:57,436
- 你为什么让他这么做？  - 我和你一样被说服了
- Why did you let him do it? - I was convinced just like you were.

269
00:31:57,603 --> 00:32:01,023
- 被我们的好医生用针  - 有进展吗？
- By the good doctor's hypo. - Anything?

270
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:02,525
唔…
Hmm...

271
00:32:02,733 --> 00:32:08,280
很少见的设备，是一个控制单元，但不是一个控制装置
A most unusual device. A control unit, but not a control mechanism.

272
00:32:08,447 --> 00:32:11,617
- 它不是机械装置  - 它究竟是什么？
- It is not a mechanical device. - What is it?

273
00:32:11,867 --> 00:32:15,538
这个装置与一种电能量模式相协调
It's attuned to only one electrical pattern of energy,

274
00:32:15,704 --> 00:32:19,375
这种模式是由拥有它的人的精神冲动产生的
the pattern produced by the mental impulses of the person who possesses it.

275
00:32:19,625 --> 00:32:23,045
它仅由精神命令激活
It is activated solely by mental commands.

276
00:32:23,337 --> 00:32:27,508
你能重新调整它，以适应我们的大脑模式吗？
Can you adapt it, re-attune it, to fit our brain patterns?

277
00:32:27,675 --> 00:32:34,890
我会尝试的，但是一次不能适应多个模式
I shall attempt it. But it is not possible to fit more than one pattern at a time.

278
00:32:35,141 --> 00:32:39,687
我熟悉我自己的模式，有了你的许可…
I am familiar with my own pattern. With your permission...

279
00:32:39,854 --> 00:32:41,730
随你做什么只要让它工作
Do what you have to do to make it work.

280
00:32:41,897 --> 00:32:46,569
令我不安的是为什么维恩人让我们保留它
What disturbs me is why the Vians let us keep it.

281
00:32:47,695 --> 00:32:52,324
真有趣，他们一定知道我们有能力理解和使用这个装置
They must know we are capable of comprehending and using this control.

282
00:32:52,491 --> 00:32:56,245
- 我们会用它来逃脱  - 合逻辑假设是
- And that we would use it to escape. - The logical assumption

283
00:32:56,412 --> 00:32:58,414
他们想让我们走
is that they wish to let us go.

284
00:32:58,664 --> 00:33:03,502
- 他们留下了麦考伊  - 那显然是他们的意图
- And they keep McCoy. - That is evidently their intention.

285
00:33:08,674 --> 00:33:14,221
不知何故，你是这一切的症结和焦点
Somehow, you're the crux, the focal point of all this.

286
00:33:15,806 --> 00:33:20,269
在我们到达这里之前，她是一名囚犯，他们没有伤害或威胁她
Before we got here, she was a prisoner. They didn't hurt or threaten her.

287
00:33:20,436 --> 00:33:24,273
事实表明她对他们的目的至关重要
The facts would indicate she is essential to their purpose.

288
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:28,402
是的，有目的，但目的是什么？
Yes, there is a purpose, but what is it?

289
00:33:32,823 --> 00:33:40,623
对你来说，所有的痛苦和恐惧是自己发生的，还是故意为之？
Has all the pain and terror happened, or been made to happen, for you?

290
00:33:42,458 --> 00:33:48,714
好了，舰长，调整很脆弱，可能无法使用一次以上
Completed. Adjustments are delicate and may not survive more than one use.

291
00:33:48,881 --> 00:33:53,719
但是，应该有足够的能量将我们传送到企业号上
However, there should be sufficient energy to transfer us to the Enterprise.

292
00:33:55,304 --> 00:33:58,849
- 能带我们去找麦考伊吗？  - 如果你想的话
- Will it take us to McCoy? - If you so desire.

293
00:34:06,148 --> 00:34:10,986
最好的防守是强大的进攻，我打算现在就开始进攻
The best defense is a strong offense. I intend to start offending right now.

294
00:34:15,950 --> 00:34:18,327
以实验室为目标
Aim for the lab.

295
00:34:24,250 --> 00:34:25,876
老骨头…
Bones...

296
00:34:39,098 --> 00:34:40,391
史波克
Spock.

297
00:34:41,433 --> 00:34:43,519
把他弄下来
Get him down.

298
00:34:44,937 --> 00:34:47,022
他的手腕
His wrists.

299
00:35:02,621 --> 00:35:05,124
他的脉搏几乎没有了
His pulse is almost gone.

300
00:35:07,543 --> 00:35:10,379
- 他怎么样？  - 严重的心脏损伤
- How is he? - Severe heart damage.

301
00:35:10,546 --> 00:35:15,551
双肺充血的迹象，循环衰竭的症状
Signs of congestion in both lungs. Evidence of circulatory collapse.

302
00:35:17,344 --> 00:35:18,637
[喘气]
[GASPS]

303
00:35:18,804 --> 00:35:20,723
别说话
Don't talk.

304
00:35:20,973 --> 00:35:26,061
别说话，放轻松，直到我们把你送回船上
Don't speak. Take it easy until we get you back to the ship.

305
00:35:37,906 --> 00:35:41,160
怎么了？有什么麻烦？  - 他快死了，吉姆
- What is it? What's the matter? - He's dying, Jim.

306
00:35:41,368 --> 00:35:45,706
- 我们能让他舒服一些，但仅此而已  - 你不知道，你不是医生
- We can only make him comfortable. - You don't know. You're not a doctor.

307
00:35:45,873 --> 00:35:47,541
[麦考伊耳语]
[MCCOY WHISPERS]

308
00:35:55,341 --> 00:36:00,596
内伤，胸部和腹部出血
Internal injuries. Bleeding in chest and abdomen.

309
00:36:00,763 --> 00:36:03,432
脾脏和肝脏大出血
Haemorrhage of the spleen and liver.

310
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:05,726
70%肾衰竭
70% kidney failure.

311
00:36:05,893 --> 00:36:12,107
他是对的，做医生有它的缺点
He's right. Being a doctor has its drawbacks.

312
00:36:13,609 --> 00:36:16,695
我一直想知道为什么我…[咳嗽]
I always wondered why I... [COUGHS]

313
00:36:23,410 --> 00:36:25,496
麦考伊：谢谢
McCOY: Thanks.

314
00:36:27,790 --> 00:36:29,792
还能活多久？
How long?

315
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,252
随时可能死亡
It could happen any time.

316
00:36:33,796 --> 00:36:37,007
正确的医学用语，嗯，史波克？
The correct medical phrase, eh, Spock?

317
00:36:49,019 --> 00:36:53,816
你对病人的态度很好，史波克
You've got a good bedside manner, Spock.

318
00:37:06,286 --> 00:37:08,580
我们不能做点什么吗？
Can't we do something?

319
00:37:09,957 --> 00:37:12,626
恐怕不能
I'm afraid not.

320
00:37:24,972 --> 00:37:28,016
宝石或许能帮助他，像她帮助我一样
Gem might be able to help him the way she helped me.

321
00:37:28,183 --> 00:37:31,645
但他的濒临死亡会杀死她吗？
But could his nearness to death also kill her?

322
00:37:31,812 --> 00:37:34,982
不确定，麦考伊对她反应的分析
Uncertain. McCoy's analysis of her reaction

323
00:37:35,149 --> 00:37:39,027
假设自我保护本能会阻止它
assumes that her instinct for self-preservation would prevent it.

324
00:37:39,194 --> 00:37:43,115
- 但我们不能确定  - 如果她能让他变得强壮
- But we cannot be positive. - If she could just strengthen him

325
00:37:43,323 --> 00:37:47,703
不让他陷入死亡，我们说不定还能救他
and keep him from sinking into death, we might be able to save him.

326
00:37:51,874 --> 00:37:54,460
不允许干扰
No interference will be permitted.

327
00:37:57,838 --> 00:38:02,217
她可以救他一命，让我们帮她去找他
She can save his life. Let us help her to go to him.

328
00:38:02,384 --> 00:38:05,137
不应敦促她采取行动
She must not be urged to take action.

329
00:38:05,304 --> 00:38:10,017
一切都必须在不受干扰的情况下进行  - 把我们带到一起的目的…
- All must proceed without interference. - The purpose that brought us...

330
00:38:10,184 --> 00:38:14,146
除了满足你们的需要之外，这一切还有什么目的？
What purpose can all this serve except to fulfil a need of yours?

331
00:38:14,313 --> 00:38:19,902
我们的一生只剩下一种需要，看看我们测试的完成情况
We have but one need left in life. To see the completion of our test.

332
00:38:20,110 --> 00:38:23,572
- 要有耐心  - 耐心？我们的朋友快死了
- Be patient. - Patient? Our friend is dying.

333
00:38:23,739 --> 00:38:25,407
也许
Perhaps.

334
00:38:25,616 --> 00:38:29,369
除了带给你愉悦之外，还有什么目的？
What purpose can be served except to bring you pleasure?

335
00:38:29,536 --> 00:38:34,082
当然你知道你们的星系很快就会灭绝
Surely you know that your star system will soon be extinct.

336
00:38:34,249 --> 00:38:36,835
- 你们的太阳会新星爆发  - 我们知道
- Your sun will nova. - We know.

337
00:38:37,127 --> 00:38:40,547
它行星上的数百万居民注定要灭亡
The millions of inhabitants on its planets are doomed.

338
00:38:40,714 --> 00:38:43,425
这就是为什么我们在此
That is why we are here.

339
00:38:43,634 --> 00:38:47,429
你为了取悦自己而设计的这个死亡竞技场
This arena of death that you've devised for your pleasure.

340
00:38:47,679 --> 00:38:51,892
- 能阻止这场灾难吗？  - 不，不会
- Will it prevent this catastrophe? - No, it will not.

341
00:38:52,059 --> 00:38:54,853
但也许能拯救宝石的星球
But it may save Gem's planet.

342
00:38:55,020 --> 00:39:00,901
在米纳拉的所有行星中，我们只能将其中一个行星的居民运送到安全的地方
Of all the planets of Minara, we can only transport inhabitants of one to safety.

343
00:39:01,151 --> 00:39:04,780
如果宝石的星球是将被拯救的星球
If Gem's planet is the one that will be saved,

344
00:39:04,947 --> 00:39:10,244
我们必须毫无疑问地确定他们值得幸存
we must make certain beyond any doubt they are worthy of survival.

345
00:39:10,744 --> 00:39:15,374
我们朋友的死对这个目的有什么用？
How will the death of our friend serve this purpose?

346
00:39:15,582 --> 00:39:17,876
他的死没有帮助
His death will not serve it.

347
00:39:18,043 --> 00:39:22,047
但她为他付出生命的意愿有
But her willingness to give her life for him will.

348
00:39:22,214 --> 00:39:25,968
- 你们是她的老师  - 我们是？
- You were her teachers. - We were?

349
00:39:26,885 --> 00:39:30,973
- 她能从我们身上学到什么？  - 你的生存意志
- What could she learn from us? - Your will to survive.

350
00:39:31,181 --> 00:39:35,477
你对生活的热爱，你们求知的激情
Your love of life. Your passion to know.

351
00:39:35,644 --> 00:39:38,480
她的种族会记住这些
They're recorded in her being.

352
00:39:38,647 --> 00:39:42,484
她的星球将是幸运的
Her planet will be fortunate.

353
00:39:42,693 --> 00:39:46,780
你们每个人都愿意为他人献出自己的生命
Each of you would give his life for the others.

354
00:39:46,947 --> 00:39:51,159
我们必须查明这种本能是否已经传递给了宝石
We must find out whether that instinct has been transmitted to Gem.

355
00:39:51,326 --> 00:39:53,328
[隆隆声]
[RUMBLING]

356
00:39:54,746 --> 00:39:58,500
- 时间越来越短  - 你是对的，舰长
- Time grows short. - You were correct, Captain.

357
00:39:58,709 --> 00:40:02,671
这里发生的一切都是他们造成的
Everything that has occurred here has been caused by them.

358
00:40:02,838 --> 00:40:07,509
这是一个很棒的实验室，我们一直是研究对象
This has been a great laboratory and we have been the subjects.

359
00:40:07,676 --> 00:40:14,016
不，我们只创造了环境，那是必要的
No. We only created the circumstances. That was necessary.

360
00:40:14,224 --> 00:40:16,643
你的行为是自发的
Your actions were spontaneous.

361
00:40:17,519 --> 00:40:23,275
你已经揭示了所有物种中最真实和最好的一切
Everything truest and best in all species of beings has been revealed by you.

362
00:40:23,442 --> 00:40:27,738
那些是使文明值得生存的品质
Those are the qualities that make a civilization worthy to survive.

363
00:40:30,115 --> 00:40:32,034
看吧
Behold.

364
00:40:58,852 --> 00:41:02,147
那是最重要的
That is most significant.

365
00:41:02,314 --> 00:41:06,193
她的种族正在产生一种新的本能
An instinct new to the essence of her being is generating.

366
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:08,904
同情他人
Compassion for another

367
00:41:09,071 --> 00:41:12,741
正在成为她生命的一部分
is becoming part of her functioning life system.

368
00:43:09,691 --> 00:43:11,818
她害怕
She's afraid.

369
00:43:15,197 --> 00:43:18,617
她在自救
She's saving herself.

370
00:43:18,784 --> 00:43:22,662
她还没有拯救她的人民的本能
She does not yet have the instinct to save her people.

371
00:43:29,377 --> 00:43:32,714
- 我们失败了？  - 不
- We have failed? - No.

372
00:43:33,715 --> 00:43:36,134
还没有
No, not yet.

373
00:43:38,970 --> 00:43:43,725
舰长，麦考伊医生的生活不仅仅依赖于宝石
Captain. Dr. McCoy's life is not solely dependant on Gem.

374
00:43:43,934 --> 00:43:46,853
维恩人也一定能挽救他的生命
The Vians too must be capable of saving his life.

375
00:43:47,020 --> 00:43:49,815
- 是的  - 你不能让他死
- True. - You cannot let him die.

376
00:43:49,981 --> 00:43:52,734
他的死并不重要
His death is not important.

377
00:43:52,901 --> 00:43:56,238
我们必须看看她的自我牺牲的本能
We must see whether her instinct for self-sacrifice

378
00:43:56,446 --> 00:44:00,575
是否已经超过了她的自我保护本能
has become stronger than her instinct for self-preservation.

379
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,585
[咳嗽]
[COUGHS]

380
00:44:29,604 --> 00:44:32,941
别碰我，离我远点
Don't touch me. Stay away.

381
00:44:35,610 --> 00:44:42,117
- 吉姆，史波克，你在这里？  - 是的，老骨头
- Jim. Spock. Are you here? - Yes, Bones.

382
00:44:42,284 --> 00:44:45,245
不要让她碰我，她会死的
Don't let her touch me. She'll die.

383
00:44:46,621 --> 00:44:48,456
吉姆…
Jim...

384
00:44:49,583 --> 00:44:54,921
就算是为了救我自己，我也不能毁灭生命
I can't destroy life even if it's to save my own.

385
00:44:55,088 --> 00:45:00,135
我不能，你知道的，我不能让你这样做
I can't. You know that. I can't let you do it.

386
00:45:06,308 --> 00:45:07,601
舰长？
Captain?

387
00:45:07,767 --> 00:45:11,563
- 怎么了？  - 强烈的情绪正耗尽我们
- What is it? - The intensity of emotion is draining us

388
00:45:11,730 --> 00:45:14,399
并增强力场
and building up the force field.

389
00:45:14,566 --> 00:45:17,903
- 我知道  - 它从我们身上汲取能量，舰长
- I know. - It draws its energy from us, Captain.

390
00:45:18,111 --> 00:45:22,282
不管我们看到什么，所有的情绪都必须被压制
In spite of what we see, all emotion must be suppressed.

391
00:45:22,449 --> 00:45:25,410
它可能会削弱力场
It might weaken the field.

392
00:45:25,577 --> 00:45:27,412
我会尽力
I'll try.

393
00:45:37,339 --> 00:45:39,132
是的
Yes.

394
00:45:53,980 --> 00:45:55,815
史波克
Spock.

395
00:45:59,319 --> 00:46:03,156
我们不能利用我们的力量来改变正在发生的事情
We cannot use our powers to change what is happening.

396
00:46:03,323 --> 00:46:08,703
- 你必须拯救我们朋友的生命  - 不，我们不会
- You must save the life of our friend. - No. We will not.

397
00:46:11,373 --> 00:46:16,544
必须充分发挥她的本能，测试必须完成
Her instinct must be developed to the fullest. The test must be complete.

398
00:46:16,711 --> 00:46:22,300
成功了，宝石为她的星球赢得了生存权，她献出了自己的生命
It is. Gem earned the right of survival for her planet. She offered her life.

399
00:46:22,467 --> 00:46:27,138
- 只是献出生命还不够充分  - 如果死亡就是你想要的
- To offer is not proof enough. - If death is all you understand,

400
00:46:29,391 --> 00:46:31,977
这里有四条生命给你
here are four lives for you.

401
00:46:35,730 --> 00:46:38,400
我们不会离开我们的朋友
We will not leave our friend.

402
00:46:38,650 --> 00:46:43,738
你已经失去了感受情感的能力，你让宝石体验的情感
You can't feel the emotions you brought Gem here to experience.

403
00:46:43,905 --> 00:46:47,826
你不明白活着是什么意思
You don't understand what it is to live.

404
00:46:49,911 --> 00:46:54,249
爱和同情在你心里已经死了，你你们除了智力什么都没有
Love and compassion are dead in you. You're nothing but intellect.

405
00:47:52,307 --> 00:47:54,100
永别了
Farewell.

406
00:48:14,829 --> 00:48:17,665
- 奇怪的  - 什么让你困惑，舰长？
- Strange. - What is puzzling you?

407
00:48:17,832 --> 00:48:22,003
我并不困惑，我…敬畏
I'm not puzzled. I am... awed.

408
00:48:23,213 --> 00:48:25,715
我同意你，她让我敬畏
I'm with you. She awed me.

409
00:48:25,924 --> 00:48:28,510
不，不，我不是说宝石
I wasn't thinking of Gem.

410
00:48:28,718 --> 00:48:31,513
我在想这是多么难以置信的几率
I was thinking of that element of chance

411
00:48:31,763 --> 00:48:35,975
在无限的空间里，我们遇见宝石
that out in limitless space we should come together with Gem.

412
00:48:36,142 --> 00:48:42,148
舰长，像维恩这样的文明可以消除偶然因素
Captain, the element of chance can be eliminated by a civilization like the Vians.

413
00:48:42,315 --> 00:48:45,026
不是质疑你的计算
Not to dispute your computer,

414
00:48:45,235 --> 00:48:50,115
但从你告诉我的来看，我会说她是一颗价值不菲的珍珠
but from what little you've told me, I'd say she was a pearl of great price.

415
00:48:50,323 --> 00:48:51,366
什么，斯科特？
What, Scott?

416
00:48:51,533 --> 00:48:54,702
你不知道商人的故事吗？
You don't know the story of the merchant?

417
00:48:58,706 --> 00:49:02,377
当商人发现了一颗价值不菲的珍珠时
The merchant, who when he found one pearl of great price,

418
00:49:02,669 --> 00:49:05,296
就去变卖他所有的东西，买了它
went and sold all that he had and bought it.

419
00:49:05,463 --> 00:49:10,385
是的，她就是珍宝，维恩人是买到她还是找到了她
Yes, she was all that. But whether the Vians bought or found her,

420
00:49:10,552 --> 00:49:12,554
都无关紧要，她非常珍贵
makes little difference, she was of great value.

421
00:49:12,804 --> 00:49:18,810
就个人而言，我觉得令人着迷的是，凭借他们所有的科学知识
Personally, I find it fascinating that with all their scientific knowledge,

422
00:49:18,977 --> 00:49:23,064
他们最看重的是善良传统的人类情感
it was good old-fashioned human emotion that they valued the most.

423
00:49:23,273 --> 00:49:26,734
也许瓦肯人应该听听这个
Perhaps the Vulcans should hear about this.

424
00:49:26,901 --> 00:49:31,072
史波克先生，你能给他们讲讲这个新闻吗？
Mr. Spock, can you be prevailed upon to bring them the news?

425
00:49:31,281 --> 00:49:36,828
可能，舰长，我当然会考虑这个想法
Possibly. I shall certainly give the thought all the consideration it is due.

426
00:49:41,916 --> 00:49:46,588
- 苏鲁先生，以曲速2前进，- 是的，长官，曲速2
- Mr. Sulu. Ahead warp factor 2. - Aye, sir. Warp factor 2.
