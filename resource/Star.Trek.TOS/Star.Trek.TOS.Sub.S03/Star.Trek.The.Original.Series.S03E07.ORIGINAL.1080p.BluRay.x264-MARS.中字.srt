把它们留在原地，不存在的地方

这样银河系中的克林贡怪物就少了

带他们进来

我说我们上船后不玩把戏

94
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:44,461
那艘克林贡船的辐射太多了

- 这是一个风险  - 准备摧毁

00:09:16,326 --> 00:09:19,496
我听说过他们的暴行，死亡集中营

103

他们会折磨我们套取信息

你有东西要学， 为我们的客人编写食物合成器的程序

108
00:09:47,733 --> 00:09:52,196
- 我想搞清楚这件事  - 我们知道发生了什么

109
00:09:52,488 --> 00:09:56,241
在我们收到贝塔12A信号的那一刻
At the moment we received the signal from Beta 12A,

110
00:09:56,408 --> 00:10:00,370
克林贡人距离太远，不可能成为攻击者
the Klingons were too far distant to have been the attackers.

111
00:10:00,537 --> 00:10:05,542
而且，他们也被求救信号所吸引
Moreover, they also were attracted by a distress call.

112
00:10:09,379 --> 00:10:12,800
谎言！他们想假装我们发动战争
Lies! They want to start a war by pretending we did.

113
00:10:13,008 --> 00:10:14,551
契科夫可能是对的

114
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:18,972
克林贡人声称遵守停火协议，但发生的暴力事件…
The Klingons claim to honor the truce but there are incidents...

115
00:10:19,139 --> 00:10:22,976
- 没有证据是克林贡人做的  - 我们需要什么证明？
- No proof Klingons committed them. - What proof do we need?

116
00:10:23,143 --> 00:10:26,063
我们知道克林贡人是怎样的
We know what a Klingon is.

117
00:10:32,736 --> 00:10:36,323
我们的日志磁带将表明我们的清白
Our log tapes will indicate our innocence.

118
00:10:36,532 --> 00:10:40,536
不幸的是，不能保证他们会被相信
Unfortunately, there's no guarantee they'll be believed.

119
00:10:45,249 --> 00:10:46,458
报告

120
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:50,420
仍然联系不上星际舰队司令部，长官

121
00:10:50,587 --> 00:10:54,258
继续尝试，我们的捉到了一条外交大鱼的尾巴

125
00:11:11,441 --> 00:11:15,445
- 上尉？  - 未能与星际舰队联系

00:11:15,612 --> 00:11:19,116
改变航线为17，标记4，曲速3
Change course to 17, mark 4, warp factor 3.

当我拿下这艘船时，我会把柯克的头塞满挂在墙上
When I take this ship, I'll have Kirk's head stuffed and hung on the wall.

128
00:11:47,978 --> 00:11:50,480
他们会在我们采取行动之前杀死我们

129
00:11:50,647 --> 00:11:54,318
他们想要审问我们，了解我们的实力，我们的计划

- 他们永远不会得逞  - 我们40人对他们400人
- They never will. - We are 40 against 400.

131
00:11:59,323 --> 00:12:03,577
一个奔走的人一夜间可以割断4000人的喉咙
4,000 throats may be cut in one night by a running man.

132
00:12:03,744 --> 00:12:06,663
耐心，警觉
Patience, vigilance.

133
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:09,374
他们会犯错的
They will make their mistake.

134
00:12:09,541 --> 00:12:13,837
<i>企业号</i>将为我们提供快速结束这场战争的知识
The <i>Enterprise</i> will give us knowledge to end this war quickly.

135
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:23,847
舰长！
Captain!

136
00:12:27,184 --> 00:12:32,773
这说不通，载波正常，仍然没有外部联系
This doesn't make sense. Carriers normal. Still no outside contact.

137
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:34,399
我不明白
I don't understand.

138
00:12:34,566 --> 00:12:36,902
会是克林贡人在捣鬼吗？
Could the Klingons be doing something?

139
00:12:37,069 --> 00:12:38,362
[碰撞]
[CRASH]

140
00:12:45,869 --> 00:12:49,706
- 苏鲁？  - 改变航线，加速

那里

我无法确定它的位置
I cannot ascertain its location.

240
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:04,969

00:22:34,457 --> 00:22:37,335
一个不存在的兄弟，一个幻影殖民地

248
00:22:37,502 --> 00:22:42,173
假的求救信号，这些武器的创造

249
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:46,135
斯波克先生，你看到规律了吗？
Do you sense a pattern, Mr. Spock?

250
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:49,806
如果外星人正在创造这些事件

251
00:22:49,973 --> 00:22:54,310
它显然能够操纵物质和思想

00:22:55,395 --> 00:22:59,816
它控制着<i>企业号</i>，将我们带出银河系
It has control of the <i>Enterprise</i>, taking us out of the galaxy.

253
00:22:59,983 --> 00:23:03,486
- 为什么？  - 我不得不指出
- Why? - I'm constrained to point out,

254
00:23:03,987 --> 00:23:06,698
因为思维正在受到影响
that since minds are being influenced,

255
00:23:06,864 --> 00:23:12,161
我们无法知道我们自己的记忆是否准确和真实
we cannot know whether our own memories are accurate and true.

256
00:23:12,370 --> 00:23:14,497
我们必须和康谈谈
We must talk to Kang.

257
00:23:14,664 --> 00:23:18,001
- 停战  - 适当的术语

258
00:23:18,418 --> 00:23:22,505
但很难与克林贡人停战
But it is difficult to arrange a truce with the Klingons

259
00:23:22,672 --> 00:23:24,507
一旦流血开始

260
00:23:24,674 --> 00:23:27,677
停战？你是认真的吗？

医务室里有些人正在死去，他们的身上发生了暴行
I've got men in Sickbay, some dying, atrocities committed on their persons.

262
00:23:33,349 --> 00:23:36,936
你说要与这些恶魔和解？
And you talk about making peace with these fiends?

263
00:23:37,103 --> 00:23:39,022
他们马上就会扑向我们
They'd jump us in a minute,

264
00:23:39,522 --> 00:23:42,191
你知道克林贡人是怎么对待囚犯的
and you know what Klingons do to prisoners.

265
00:23:42,358 --> 00:23:45,570
- 奴役，死亡星球，实验！  - 麦考伊？
- Slavery, death planets, experiments! - McCoy?

266
00:23:45,737 --> 00:23:49,699
你在滔滔不绝，他们在计划攻击，这是一场生死搏斗
You talk, they plan attacks. This is a fight to the death.

267
00:23:49,866 --> 00:23:53,911
- 我们最好努力赢得它！  - 我们正试图结束它
- We'd better try to win it! - We are attempting to end it.

268
00:23:54,537 --> 00:23:59,709
有更好的理由，船上的外星人可能造成了这种情况。
By reason, preferably. An alien on board may have created the situation.

269
00:23:59,876 --> 00:24:03,337
谁在乎是什么开始的？我们被卷入了
Who cares what started it? We're in it!

270
00:24:03,546 --> 00:24:06,257
杀人犯！我们应该消灭他们！

271
00:24:06,466 --> 00:24:10,595
外星人才是真正的威胁，是我们必须消灭的敌人

272
00:24:11,137 --> 00:24:16,100
医务室呼叫，更多伤员需要你的关注
Sickbay calling. More wounded men require your attention.

273
00:24:22,065 --> 00:24:28,780
在你表现得像军人而不是傻瓜之前，还要死多少人？
How many more must die before you act like military men instead of fools?

274

I have deprived all areas except our own.

280
00:24:57,809 --> 00:25:01,521
你会窒息而死
You will die of suffocation

281
00:25:01,687 --> 00:25:04,982
在冰冷的太空中
in the icy cold of space.

282
00:25:27,421 --> 00:25:30,842
<i>企业号</i>正驶出我们的银河系
The <i>Enterprise</i> is heading out of our galaxy,

283
00:25:31,008 --> 00:25:36,055
由船上某处的神秘外星人控制
controlled by a mysterious alien somewhere aboard the ship.

284
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:39,851
轮机部已被克林贡人接管
Engineering has been taken over by Klingons

285
00:25:40,017 --> 00:25:42,854
他们切断了生命支持系统
who have cut off life-support systems.

286
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:46,023
苏鲁先生，去紧急手动控制那里
Mr. Sulu, go to emergency manual control.

287
00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:50,862
尽量保护生命支持电路和辅助动力
Try to protect life-support circuits and auxiliary power.

288
00:25:52,196 --> 00:25:55,324
- 契科夫是对的，舰长  - 斯科提，我很高兴…
- Chekov was right, Captain. - Scotty, I'm glad...

289
00:25:55,491 --> 00:25:59,495
我们应该把那些毛脸的暴徒留在传送器里
We should have left those fuzz-faced goons in the transporter.

290
00:25:59,662 --> 00:26:02,331
- 那是他们该待的地方  - 斯科提？
- That's where they belong. - Scotty?

291
00:26:02,498 --> 00:26:03,833
不存在的地方！
Non-existence!

292
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,004
现在他们可以研究<i>企业号</i>，学习我们的技术
Now they can study the <i>Enterprise</i>, add our technology to theirs,

293
00:26:08,171 --> 00:26:12,592
打破实力平衡，你危害了联邦！
change the balance of power. You've jeopardized the Federation!

294
00:26:12,758 --> 00:26:16,262
- 别紧张  - 把你的瓦肯手拿开！
- Take it easy. - Keep your Vulcan hands off me!

295
00:26:17,346 --> 00:26:21,267
不要碰我，你的感情可能会受到伤害
Just keep away. Your feelings might be hurt,

296
00:26:21,517 --> 00:26:25,188
你这个绿血的杂种！
you green-blooded half-breed!

297
00:26:25,354 --> 00:26:29,358
我能说我并不完全享受与人类共事
May I say that I have not thoroughly enjoyed serving with humans.

298
00:26:29,525 --> 00:26:33,779
我发现他们不合逻辑和愚蠢的情绪总是令人恼火
I find their illogic and foolish emotions a constant irritant.

299
00:26:33,988 --> 00:26:36,532
然后你滚出去，怪胎！
Then transfer out, freak!

300
00:26:41,245 --> 00:26:42,496
先生们！
Gentlemen!

301
00:26:44,582 --> 00:26:47,126
史波克，斯科提，史波克
Spock. Scotty. Spock.

302
00:26:47,293 --> 00:26:49,212
史波克！
Spock!

303
00:26:50,296 --> 00:26:52,757
停下来！你这个半人…
Stop it! You half-human...

304
00:26:58,763 --> 00:27:03,100
我们在说什么？我们在对彼此做什么？
What are we saying? What are we doing to each other?

305
00:27:04,227 --> 00:27:08,439
真有趣，压力…的结果？
Fascinating. The result of... stress?

306
00:27:08,606 --> 00:27:10,483
我们之前一直处于压力之下
We've been under stress before.

307
00:27:10,650 --> 00:27:13,319
它从来不会让我们互相扼住对方的喉咙
It's never set us at each other's throats.

308
00:27:13,527 --> 00:27:16,530
- 这是战争  - 没有战争！
- This is war. - There isn't any war!

309
00:27:19,617 --> 00:27:20,993
还是说有？
Or is there?

310
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:24,997
我们是否忘记了如何保卫自己？
Have we forgotten how to defend ourselves?

311
00:27:25,164 --> 00:27:27,625
我们怎么了？
What's happening to us?

312
00:27:27,833 --> 00:27:32,338
我们被训练去思考战争以外的其他方面
We've been trained to think in other terms than war.

313
00:27:32,546 --> 00:27:36,509
我们被训练与战争的起因斗争，如果必要的话
We've been trained to fight its causes, if necessary.

314
00:27:36,676 --> 00:27:40,846
那为什么我们表现得像一群野蛮人？
Then why are we behaving like a group of savages?

315
00:27:41,055 --> 00:27:43,599
看着我
Look at me.

316
00:27:43,766 --> 00:27:45,768
看着我
Look at me.

317
00:27:51,774 --> 00:27:55,152
这艘船上有两股力量
Two forces aboard this ship,

318
00:27:55,319 --> 00:27:58,447
他们装备得相当
each of them equally armed.

319
00:27:59,323 --> 00:28:03,119
为我们安排了一场战争吗？
Has a war been staged for us?

320
00:28:04,161 --> 00:28:06,998
有武器
Complete with weapons,

321
00:28:07,290 --> 00:28:11,669
和意识形态和爱国鼓声？
and ideology and patriotic drum-beating?

322
00:28:11,836 --> 00:28:13,838
甚至…
Even...

323
00:28:14,088 --> 00:28:15,381
史波克
Spock.

324
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:20,636
甚至…种族仇恨？
Even... race hatred?

325
00:28:22,013 --> 00:28:26,726
事件似乎旨在放大人类与克林贡人之间的
Events seem to be directed toward magnification of the basic hostilities

326
00:28:26,892 --> 00:28:29,312
基本敌对行动
between humans and Klingons.

327
00:28:29,478 --> 00:28:33,983
显然，我们战斗是被设计好的
Apparently, it is by design that we fight.

328
00:28:34,191 --> 00:28:38,070
- 我们似乎是棋子  - 但这是什么游戏？
- We seem to be pawns. - But what's the game?

329
00:28:38,237 --> 00:28:41,490
谁的游戏？规则是什么？
And whose? And what are the rules?

330
00:28:41,824 --> 00:28:46,412
最紧迫的是我们立即定位外星实体
It is most urgent that we locate the alien entity immediately,

331
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:50,583
确定其动机并停止其活动
determine its motives and halt its activities.

332
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:56,672
没有传感器？没有电？这东西可以去任何地方！
Without sensors? All our power down? This thing could go anywhere!

333
00:28:56,839 --> 00:28:58,382
是的
Yes.

334
00:29:03,137 --> 00:29:05,348
- 苏鲁先生，报告  - <i>不好</i>
- Mr. Sulu, report. - <i>No good.</i>

335
00:29:05,514 --> 00:29:10,019
电路在，但系统没有响应
Circuits are in but systems aren't responding.

336
00:29:11,937 --> 00:29:14,023
我们得到了一些东西
We're getting something.

337
00:29:15,191 --> 00:29:20,404
是的，舰长，电力和生命支持恢复了
Aye, Captain. Power and life-support restored.

338
00:29:20,571 --> 00:29:22,865
- 遥控器在待机状态  - <i>干得好</i>
- Remotes on standby. - <i>Good work.</i>

339
00:29:23,032 --> 00:29:28,079
但是，舰长，不是我干的，一切都是自己发生的
But, Captain, I didn't do it. Everything just came on by itself.

340
00:29:33,376 --> 00:29:35,961
他们的生命支持系统已经恢复
Their life-support systems have resumed.

341
00:29:36,295 --> 00:29:40,966
- 传感器可能正在运行  - 开始扫描，让我们找到那个外星人
- Sensors may be operating. - Start scanning. Let's find that alien.

342
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:46,972
- 保持稳定  - 使它们不稳定
- Holding steady. - Cause them to be unsteady.

343
00:29:52,269 --> 00:29:56,482
他们似乎是从另一个位置控制的
They appear to be controlled from another location.

344
00:29:56,732 --> 00:30:01,737
也无法影响返回我们帝国的飞船航线
Also unable to effect ship's course for return to our empire.

345
00:30:01,904 --> 00:30:04,073
柯克的伎俩之一
One of Kirk's tricks.

346
00:30:05,324 --> 00:30:08,577
他能绕过电路吗？
Could he bypass a circuit?

347
00:30:09,745 --> 00:30:15,000
是什么力量支持着我们的战斗，却不让我们获胜？
What power is it that supports our battle yet starves our victory?

348
00:30:15,209 --> 00:30:18,003
力量
Power.

349
00:30:18,212 --> 00:30:22,174
在他们的主要生命支持耦接头处中断它。在哪里？
Interrupt it at their main life-support couplings. Where?

350
00:30:22,341 --> 00:30:25,136
6号甲板
Number 6 deck.

351
00:30:25,803 --> 00:30:27,596
来
Come.

352
00:30:44,530 --> 00:30:50,327
在轮机室检测到外星人，3号反应堆附近
Alien detected in the engineering section, near reactor number 3.

353
00:30:51,537 --> 00:30:53,789
我们走吧
Let's go.

354
00:31:54,517 --> 00:31:56,852
你还没有死
You don't die... yet.

355
00:31:59,813 --> 00:32:05,819
你不是人类，但你很漂亮
You're not human, but you're very beautiful.

356
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:09,907
很…漂亮
Very... beautiful.

357
00:32:20,125 --> 00:32:22,211
[喘气声]
[GASPS]

358
00:32:28,217 --> 00:32:29,843
契科夫！
Chekov!

359
00:32:33,931 --> 00:32:36,934
吉姆，他没有责任
Jim. He's not responsible.

360
00:32:42,565 --> 00:32:44,400
我做了什么？
What have I done?

361
00:32:55,119 --> 00:33:00,291
船上的一个外星实体迫使我们战斗，我们不想
An alien entity aboard the ship is forcing us to fight. We don't want to.

362
00:33:00,457 --> 00:33:05,421
我们不知道它的动机，我们正试图找出答案，你必须帮助我们
We don't know its motive. We're trying to find out. You must help us.

363
00:33:05,588 --> 00:33:08,591
带我去见康，我只要求暂时休战
Take me to Kang. A temporary truce is all I ask.

364
00:33:13,971 --> 00:33:16,432
史波克，带上她
Spock, take her.

365
00:33:19,935 --> 00:33:21,812
契科夫
Chekov.

366
00:33:27,192 --> 00:33:31,822
这是为我们准备的吗？从这里开始？
Is this what's in store for us? From here on in?

367
00:33:32,114 --> 00:33:34,783
暴力？仇恨？
Violence? Hatred?

368
00:33:52,968 --> 00:33:56,639
脑电波显示偏执狂躁症，发生了什么？
Brain waves show paranoid mania. What happened?

369
00:33:56,805 --> 00:34:00,976
他失去了控制，我也是
He lost control. So did I.

370
00:34:01,143 --> 00:34:04,855
我们正在成为野兽战士
We're becoming animal warriors.

371
00:34:05,022 --> 00:34:07,191
- 我们走吧，史波克  - 勤务兵
- Let's go, Spock. - Orderly.

372
00:34:07,358 --> 00:34:09,151
吉姆…
Jim...

373
00:34:13,072 --> 00:34:16,909
约翰逊的伤几乎痊愈了，和其他人一样
Johnson's wound is almost healed. Same with the others.

374
00:34:17,076 --> 00:34:20,204
重要器官的刀伤，巨大的创伤
Sword wounds in vital organs, massive trauma.

375
00:34:20,371 --> 00:34:25,668
- 正在以惊人的速度愈合  - 实体似乎希望我们活着
- All healing at a fantastic rate. - It appears the entity wants us alive.

376
00:34:25,876 --> 00:34:29,380
为什么？那样我们可以不挺战斗
Why? So we can fight and fight

377
00:34:29,546 --> 00:34:33,008
并继续回来，就像一些血腥的竞技场一样？
and keep coming back for more like some bloody coliseum?

378
00:34:33,175 --> 00:34:38,389
- 下一步是什么？人群的欢呼？  - 也许我们的心理
- What's next? The roar of crowds? - Perhaps our psychologies

379
00:34:38,681 --> 00:34:41,433
和战斗能力正在受到一个外星人的考验
and combat capabilities are being tested

380
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:44,520
他设计了这两种能力
by an alien with designs on both powers.

381
00:34:44,687 --> 00:34:49,191
如果我们是棋子，那么你看到的是一颗极度后悔的
If we are pawns, you're looking at one who's extremely sorry.

382
00:34:50,192 --> 00:34:55,364
我理解，我也感受到了短暂而澎湃种族偏见
I understand. I too felt a brief surge of racial bigotry.

383
00:34:55,531 --> 00:34:57,866
非常令人不悦
Most distasteful.

384
00:34:58,033 --> 00:35:00,786
让我们找到外星人
Let's find the alien.

385
00:35:01,036 --> 00:35:03,706
你和我们一起来
You come with us.

386
00:35:03,872 --> 00:35:06,875
也许我们可以向你证明它存在
Maybe we can prove to you that it exists.

387
00:35:32,568 --> 00:35:36,405
- 它是什么？  - 完全不清楚
- What is it? - Totally unfamiliar.

388
00:35:42,953 --> 00:35:46,081
你想要什么？
What is it you want?

389
00:35:46,248 --> 00:35:48,917
你在这里做什么？
What are you doing here?

390
00:35:50,127 --> 00:35:52,337
报到，长官
Reporting for duty, sir.

391
00:35:53,756 --> 00:35:58,051
- 报到？麦考伊让你走的吗？  - 我让自己走的
- Duty? Did McCoy release you? - I released myself.

392
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:01,764
- 那就回医务室  - 我很健康，准备好行动了
- Then get back to Sickbay. - I'm fit and ready for action.

393
00:36:01,930 --> 00:36:04,683
克林贡人差点把我弄进去
The Klingons almost did me in.

394
00:36:04,850 --> 00:36:07,770
- 我命令你…- 我有我的命令
- I order you... - I've got my orders.

395
00:36:07,936 --> 00:36:11,690
- 杀了克林贡人，不是他们就是我们  - 约翰逊！
- Kill the Klingons. It's them or us. - Johnson!

396
00:36:22,117 --> 00:36:24,203
真有趣
Fascinating.

397
00:36:24,453 --> 00:36:29,875
在约翰逊的情绪爆发期间，他的仇恨和对复仇的欲望
During Johnson's emotional outburst, his hatred and lust for vengeance,

398
00:36:30,083 --> 00:36:33,629
外星人的生命能量水平增加了。
the alien's life energy level increased.

399
00:36:33,796 --> 00:36:38,717
当他失去知觉时，外星人失去了能量
When he became unconscious, the alien lost energy.

400
00:36:38,884 --> 00:36:41,970
靠别人的情绪生存？
It subsists on the emotions of others?

401
00:36:42,805 --> 00:36:45,349
这一点似乎被敌意
This one appears to be strengthened

402
00:36:45,516 --> 00:36:51,146
和暴力意图的精神辐射所加强
by mental radiations of hostility, violent intentions.

403
00:36:52,314 --> 00:36:57,069
它存在于他人的仇恨中
It exists on the hate of others.

404
00:36:57,236 --> 00:37:01,073
简而言之，它起到了催化剂的作用
To put it simply. And it has acted as a catalyst,

405
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:04,993
创造这种情况，以满足这种需要
creating this situation, in order to satisfy that need.

406
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:10,332
它汇集了敌对势力，提供了粗陋的手段
It has brought together opposing forces, provided crude instruments,

407
00:37:10,499 --> 00:37:14,378
努力促进最暴力的冲突模式
in an effort to promote the most violent mode of conflict.

408
00:37:14,628 --> 00:37:18,423
并保持数量和资源平衡
And kept numbers and resources balanced,

409
00:37:18,674 --> 00:37:22,678
以便它可以维持一种持续的暴力状态
so that it can maintain a constant state of violence.

410
00:37:22,845 --> 00:37:28,183
它一定有弱点，我们必须摆脱它
It's got to have a vulnerable area. We've got to get rid of it.

411
00:37:28,350 --> 00:37:32,104
然后，必须消除船上的所有敌对态度
Then all hostile attitudes on board must be eliminated.

412
00:37:32,271 --> 00:37:36,859
- 战斗必须很快结束  - 否则我们是一艘注定要失败的船
- The fighting must end. And soon. - Or we're a doomed ship,

413
00:37:37,067 --> 00:37:41,196
永远在星系之间旅行，充满了杀戮
traveling forever between galaxies, filled with bloodlust,

414
00:37:41,363 --> 00:37:44,157
永恒的战争
eternal warfare.

415
00:37:44,366 --> 00:37:49,079
康必须要听，我们必须共享我们的知识
Kang has got to listen. We've got to pool our knowledge.

416
00:37:49,246 --> 00:37:52,082
并摆脱这件事
And get rid of this thing.

417
00:38:04,678 --> 00:38:06,555
康
Kang.

418
00:38:07,306 --> 00:38:10,100
康，我是柯克舰长
Kang, this is Captain Kirk.

419
00:38:10,267 --> 00:38:12,060
<i>你听到了吗？</i>
<i>Do you read me?</i>

420
00:38:12,227 --> 00:38:15,230
指挥官，这是个伎俩！
Commander, it's a trick!

421
00:38:21,194 --> 00:38:23,071
康
Kang.

422
00:38:26,241 --> 00:38:30,579
- 他不会回答  - 外星人正在影响他的思想
- He won't answer. - The alien is affecting his mind.

423
00:38:30,746 --> 00:38:35,751
很快，它就会强大到我们无人能抵抗它
Soon, it will become so powerful that none of us will be able to resist it.

424
00:38:37,961 --> 00:38:42,591
斯科提，长官，二锂晶体正在恶化，我们无法阻止
Scotty, sir. The dilithium crystals are deteriorating. We can't stop it.

425
00:38:42,799 --> 00:38:44,426
时间因数？
Time factor?

426
00:38:44,718 --> 00:38:48,430
<i>12分钟内，我们将失去引擎动力</i>
<i>In 12 minutes, we'll be without engine power.</i>

427
00:38:50,265 --> 00:38:54,603
好吧，尽你所能，通话完毕
Well, do whatever you can. Kirk out.

428
00:39:09,284 --> 00:39:12,329
所以我们在太空中漂流
And so we drift in space,

429
00:39:12,496 --> 00:39:16,333
船上只有仇恨和杀戮
with only hatred and bloodshed aboard.

430
00:39:18,168 --> 00:39:21,254
现在，你相信了吗？
Now, do you believe?

431
00:39:29,513 --> 00:39:33,850
柯克：<i>舰长日志，星历…大决战</i>
KIRK: <i>Captain's log, stardate... Armageddon.</i>

432
00:39:34,476 --> 00:39:37,854
<i>我们必须找到一种方法来击败</i>
<i>We must find a way to defeat the alien force of hate</i>

433
00:39:38,063 --> 00:39:42,192
<i>接管</i>企业号<i>的外星仇恨力量，现在停止战争</i>
<i>that has taken over the</i> Enterprise, <i>stop the war now,</i>

434
00:39:42,359 --> 00:39:47,197
<i>或在无用，血腥的暴力中度过永恒</i>
<i>or spend eternity in futile, bloody violence.</i>

435
00:39:47,364 --> 00:39:50,033
没变化，二锂晶体正在放电
No change. The dilithium crystals are discharging.

436
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:52,615
我们对此无能为力
There's nothing we can do about it.

437
00:39:53,021 --> 00:39:54,677
如果我能和康谈谈
If I could talk to Kang,

438
00:39:54,913 --> 00:39:59,334
切断克林贡防线，在为时已晚之前实现和平
cut through the Klingon lines, make peace before it's too late.

439
00:39:59,584 --> 00:40:02,713
能量还能撑9分53秒
We have nine minutes, 53 seconds to power zero.

440
00:40:03,004 --> 00:40:05,841
当然，还有一个合乎逻辑的选择
There is of course, a logical alternative.

441
00:40:06,174 --> 00:40:08,343
康的妻子是我们的囚犯
Kang's wife is our prisoner.

442
00:40:08,510 --> 00:40:11,763
- 也许是一种威胁…  - 是的！
- Perhaps a threat... - Aye!

443
00:40:11,930 --> 00:40:14,808
这是克林贡人会理解的事情
That's something the Klingons would understand.

444
00:40:28,363 --> 00:40:29,823
康！
Kang!

445
00:40:30,699 --> 00:40:35,454
这是柯克舰长，我知道你能听到我的声音，所以不要挂断
This is Captain Kirk. I know you can hear me so don't cut me off.

446
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:38,707
<i>我们有玛拉，你的妻子</i>
<i>We have Mara, your wife.</i>

447
00:40:38,874 --> 00:40:43,754
<i>我们现在商量休战，否则她会死，回复</i>
<i>We talk truce now, or she dies. Reply.</i>

448
00:40:46,590 --> 00:40:49,217
她还有五秒钟的生命
She has five seconds to live.

449
00:40:49,718 --> 00:40:51,553
回复
Reply.

450
00:40:58,435 --> 00:41:01,605
她是战争的受害者，舰长
She is a victim of war, Captain.

451
00:41:02,856 --> 00:41:05,233
<i>她明白</i>
<i>She understands.</i>

452
00:41:06,234 --> 00:41:09,112
他认为我在虚张声势
He called my bluff.

453
00:41:09,279 --> 00:41:10,906
你不会…
You're not going to...

454
00:41:11,072 --> 00:41:15,243
联邦不杀囚犯，那是宣传
The Federation doesn't kill prisoners. That's propaganda.

455
00:41:15,410 --> 00:41:18,497
- 多少时间？  - 8分42秒
- How much time? - Eight minutes, 42 seconds.

456
00:41:21,416 --> 00:41:25,587
- 所以这不是把戏  - 斯科特：是外星人干的
- So this was no trick. - SCOTT: It's the alien that's done this.

457
00:41:25,754 --> 00:41:28,590
我们在它的控制中，我们所有人
We're in its power. All of us.

458
00:41:28,757 --> 00:41:31,259
我们想停止战斗以拯救我们所有人
We wanted to stop the fighting to save us all.

459
00:41:31,426 --> 00:41:35,263
我们一直在战斗，我们必须
We have always fought. We must.

460
00:41:35,430 --> 00:41:41,102
我们是猎人，追踪并获取我们需要的东西
We are hunters, tracking and taking what we need.

461
00:41:41,269 --> 00:41:44,439
克林贡星系中有一些可怜的行星
There are poor planets in the Klingon systems,

462
00:41:44,648 --> 00:41:47,692
如果我们要生存，就必须向外推进
we must push outward if we are to survive.

463
00:41:48,777 --> 00:41:52,823
还有另一种生存方式，相互信任和帮助
There's another way to survive. Mutual trust and help.

464
00:41:59,704 --> 00:42:02,207
我现在就帮你
I will help you now.

465
00:42:03,291 --> 00:42:06,711
- 如何？  - 我带你去见康
- How? - I will take you to Kang.

466
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:10,465
- 我会帮你说话  - 我不会相信她
- I will add my voice to yours. - I wouldn't trust her.

467
00:42:12,801 --> 00:42:16,471
我们无法及时通过克林贡防御
We can't get through the Klingon defenses in time.

468
00:42:16,638 --> 00:42:18,974
除非…
Unless...

469
00:42:19,975 --> 00:42:22,143
史波克
Spock.

470
00:42:22,310 --> 00:42:26,523
在船内从一个区域传送到另一区域， 可能吗？
Intra-ship beaming from one section to another. It's possible?

471
00:42:26,731 --> 00:42:32,028
由于所涉及的风险，很少有人这样做
It has rarely been done because of the danger involved.

472
00:42:32,195 --> 00:42:37,033
如果运输者在固体物体、甲板或墙壁内实体化…
If the transportee materialized inside a solid object, a deck or a wall...

473
00:42:37,325 --> 00:42:41,496
即使它可以奏效，她也可能将你带入陷阱
Even if it could work, she may be leading you into a trap.

474
00:42:41,663 --> 00:42:44,207
我们都在陷阱中，这是唯一的出路
We're all in a trap. This is the only way out.

475
00:42:44,374 --> 00:42:48,837
- 我们和你一起去  - 不，那将开始最后的战斗
- We'll go with you. - No, that would start the final battle.

476
00:42:53,049 --> 00:42:55,218
我相信她
I believe her.

477
00:42:58,597 --> 00:43:02,726
准备传送机，我们会等待你的信号
Prepare the transporter. We'll wait for your signal.

478
00:43:02,976 --> 00:43:07,564
她不能保证康会停下来听，对吧，史波克先生？
She can't guarantee that Kang will stop to listen. Right, Mr. Spock?

479
00:43:07,731 --> 00:43:12,360
没有人可以保证另一个人的行为
No one can guarantee the actions of another.

480
00:43:20,535 --> 00:43:23,246
<i>您的自动设置已完成</i>
<i>Your automatic setting is laid in.</i>

481
00:43:23,413 --> 00:43:27,959
当传送器通电时，您将有八秒钟的时间到达传送台
When transporter is energized, you will have eight seconds to get to the pads.

482
00:43:28,126 --> 00:43:31,087
我希望你的计算是正确的
I hope your computations are correct.

483
00:43:31,254 --> 00:43:34,132
<i>你将在7.9秒内知道</i>
<i>You will know in 7.9 seconds.</i>

484
00:43:53,068 --> 00:43:56,738
玛拉，你还活着，你给我们带来了战利品
Mara. You're alive and you bring us a prize.

485
00:43:56,905 --> 00:44:01,826
康，等等！他一个人来的，手无寸铁，他必须和你谈谈
Kang wait! He's come alone, unarmed. He must talk to you.

486
00:44:02,035 --> 00:44:06,456
- 勇敢的舰长，关于什么？  - 不！听他说
- Brave captain. What about? - No! Listen to him.

487
00:44:06,623 --> 00:44:09,334
- 我们都处于危险之中  - 玛拉
- We are all in danger. - Mara.

488
00:44:09,542 --> 00:44:12,295
在你开始杀人之前，给我一分钟
Before you start killing, give me one minute.

489
00:44:12,462 --> 00:44:15,924
- 康，不要！  - 他们对你做了什么？
- Kang, don't! - What have they done to you?

490
00:44:16,132 --> 00:44:19,803
你疯了吗？他们对你做了什么？
Are you out of your mind? What have they done to you?

491
00:44:23,765 --> 00:44:26,434
我明白了为什么野兽没有杀了你
I see why the beast did not kill you.

492
00:44:26,601 --> 00:44:29,771
他们没有伤害我，听他说！
They didn't harm me. Listen to him!

493
00:44:46,871 --> 00:44:50,625
停止！请停下来！
Stop! Stop, please!

494
00:44:55,171 --> 00:44:58,299
- 你死了，我们就赢了  - 没有人赢
- With your death, we win. - Nobody wins.

495
00:44:58,466 --> 00:45:02,470
你的手下还有人死了吗？我们不能被杀死
Have any more of your men died? We can't be killed.

496
00:45:02,637 --> 00:45:06,224
船上有外星人，它想让我们活着
There's an alien aboard. It wants us alive.

497
00:45:08,852 --> 00:45:14,024
毫无疑问，在我把你砍成碎片后，你会重新组装起来
No doubt you will reassemble after I've hacked you to bits.

498
00:45:16,109 --> 00:45:17,485
你这个傻瓜
You fool.

499
00:45:54,731 --> 00:45:55,899
听我说！
Look!

500
00:45:58,068 --> 00:46:03,114
听我说，康，在我们的余生中，千百世时间
Look, Kang. For the rest of our lives, a thousand lifetimes,

501
00:46:03,281 --> 00:46:06,201
毫无意义的暴力，战斗
senseless violence, fighting,

502
00:46:06,367 --> 00:46:11,206
而一个外星人完全控制着我们
while an alien has total control over us.

503
00:46:26,054 --> 00:46:27,263
好吧
All right.

504
00:46:28,431 --> 00:46:30,391
好吧
All right.

505
00:46:30,558 --> 00:46:35,396
在心里，在头上，我不会死去，下次，我会杀了你
In the heart, the head, I won't stay dead. Next time, I'll kill you.

506
00:46:35,563 --> 00:46:39,400
一直持续下去，战争的游戏，卒子对卒子
And it goes on and on, the game of war. Pawn against pawn.

507
00:46:39,567 --> 00:46:41,903
阻止坏人
Stopping the bad guys,

508
00:46:42,070 --> 00:46:47,283
而某个地方，某些人坐在背后大笑
while somewhere, some thing sits back and laughs.

509
00:46:48,201 --> 00:46:51,079
并重新开始
And starts it all over again.

510
00:46:54,207 --> 00:46:56,626
- 让我们扑向它  - 那些憎恨和战斗的人
- Let's jump him. - Those who hate and fight

511
00:46:56,835 --> 00:47:00,588
一定要自己停下来，否则，它不会停止
must stop themselves, otherwise, it is not stopped.

512
00:47:00,755 --> 00:47:03,967
康，我是你的妻子
Kang, I am your wife.

513
00:47:04,134 --> 00:47:07,929
我是克林贡人，我会为他们撒谎吗？
I'm a Klingon. Would I lie for them?

514
00:47:08,972 --> 00:47:12,016
听柯克说，他说的是实话
Listen to Kirk. He is telling the truth.

515
00:47:13,476 --> 00:47:18,273
做一个棋子，做一个玩具，做一个从不质疑命令的好士兵
Be a pawn, be a toy, a good soldier who never questions orders.

516
00:47:31,661 --> 00:47:36,541
- 克林贡人为了自己的目的而杀人  - 所有的战斗都必须结束
- Klingons kill for their own purposes. - All fighting must end,

517
00:47:36,791 --> 00:47:41,462
在我们的二锂晶体消失之前削弱外星人
to weaken the alien before our dilithium crystals are gone.

518
00:47:48,970 --> 00:47:51,306
- 乌乎拉  - <i>是的，舰长</i>
- Uhura. - <i>Yes, Captain.</i>

519
00:47:51,472 --> 00:47:55,310
- 把我接入全船对讲机  - <i>是的，长官</i>
- Put me on ship-wide intercom. - <i>Aye, sir.</i>

520
00:47:55,518 --> 00:47:57,645
<i>准备好了，舰长</i>
<i>Ready, Captain.</i>

521
00:47:59,355 --> 00:48:01,024
这是柯克舰长
This is Captain Kirk.

522
00:48:01,191 --> 00:48:04,527
下令休战，战斗结束了
A truce is ordered. The fighting is over.

523
00:48:04,694 --> 00:48:07,530
放下你的武器
Lay down your weapons.

524
00:48:11,659 --> 00:48:13,912
这是康
This is Kang.

525
00:48:14,078 --> 00:48:18,541
停止敌对行动，解除武装
Cease hostilities. Disarm.

526
00:48:28,301 --> 00:48:31,346
暴力的停止削弱了它
The cessation of violence has weakened it.

527
00:48:31,512 --> 00:48:36,517
我认为好心情可能是一种有效的武器
I suggest that good spirits might make an effective weapon.

528
00:48:46,903 --> 00:48:48,905
滚出我的船
Get off my ship.

529
00:48:49,239 --> 00:48:51,366
你是一只死鸭子了，我们知道你
You're a dead duck, we know about you,

530
00:48:51,532 --> 00:48:54,410
我们不想玩了
and we don't want to play.

531
00:48:55,578 --> 00:48:59,540
也许周围还有其他像你一样的东西
Maybe there are others like you around,

532
00:48:59,707 --> 00:49:05,129
也许你造成了很多痛苦，很多历史，但一切都结束了
maybe you've caused a lot of suffering, a lot of history, but that's all over.

533
00:49:05,463 --> 00:49:09,717
我们现在会保持警惕，我们会为你做好准备，所以出去吧！
We'll be on guard now, we'll be ready for you, so ship out!

534
00:49:09,884 --> 00:49:13,054
- 来吧，拉它！  - 是的，已经出去了！
- Come on, haul it! - Yeah, out already!

535
00:49:17,475 --> 00:49:21,354
出去！我们无需催促就憎恨人类
Out! We need no urging to hate humans.

536
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:27,735
但就目前而言，只有傻瓜才会在着火的房子里战斗，出去！
But for the present, only a fool fights in a burning house. Out!
