舰长，你要是允许的话
Captain, with your permission...

00:05:55,293 --> 00:05:56,071
当然可以
By all means.

80

一
One.

81
00:06:09,178 --> 00:06:10,028

如果你说出你们的目的和目标
If you will state your purpose and your objectives,

87
00:06:24,597 --> 00:06:26,837
也许我们可以达成共识
perhaps we can arrive at a mutual understanding.

88
00:06:28,458 --> 00:06:33,239
如果你了解一，你就知道我们的目的
If you understand One, you know our purpose.

89
00:06:33,497 --> 00:06:35,307
我更想听到你说出来
I would prefer that you state it.

90
00:06:36,418 --> 00:06:39,588
我们背弃混乱，寻找开始
We turn our backs on confusion and seek the beginning.

91
00:06:40,057 --> 00:06:41,226
你的目的地是哪里？
What is your destination?

92
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:42,576
伊甸星球
The planet Eden.

93

我们抗议在违背我们意愿的情况下

被骚扰、追捕、攻击、扣押和运送到这里。

00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:59,561
我们不承认联邦法规

也不承认战争行为
nor the existence of hostilities.

99
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:07,281
我们不承认任何权威，除了我们自己
We recognize no authority, save that within ourselves.

100
00:07:07,337 --> 00:07:10,025
嗯，不管你是否承认权威，在这艘船上我就是权威
Well, whether you recognize authority or not, I am it on this ship.

00:07:11,202 --> 00:07:13,775
我奉命和平地将你们送回星际基地

105
00:07:23,554 --> 00:07:25,515
哦，赫伯特，你太呆板了

史波克先生，你似乎了解这些人，你来招待他们
Mr. Spock, you seem to understand these people. You will deal with them.

我们恭敬地请求你带我们去伊甸

医务室的事务结束后

00:07:37,765 --> 00:07:41,825
确保他们被护送回各自的住处，满足他们的一切要求
see to it that they're escorted back to their proper quarters and given whatever care they need.

111
00:07:42,835 --> 00:07:47,321
我们恭敬地请求你带我们去伊甸

113
00:07:51,397 --> 00:07:52,415
这不是一艘客船
This is not a passenger ship.

00:07:52,867 --> 00:07:55,413
[全体一起唱]赫伯特！赫伯特！赫伯特！

00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:07,449
我们捉到了偷太空巡洋舰极光号的六个人

118
00:08:10,168 --> 00:08:10,562

122
00:08:14,972 --> 00:08:17,476
长官，我觉得我认识其中一个人

123
00:08:18,084 --> 00:08:20,793
我想我至少认得她的声音

124
00:08:21,763 --> 00:08:24,195
她的名字是伊琳娜·加柳林

125
00:08:25,484 --> 00:08:27,434
我们曾一起在星际舰队学院学习

126
00:08:29,444 --> 00:08:31,392
他们中有人原来是学院的？
One of those was in the Academy?

127
00:08:32,783 --> 00:08:33,406
是的，长官
Yes, sir.

128
00:08:35,004 --> 00:08:36,961
她…退学了

00:08:42,407 --> 00:08:43,044

他们在病房吗？
Are they in the Sickbay?

134
00:08:52,465 --> 00:08:52,859
是的，舰长
Yes, Captain.

135
00:08:55,697 --> 00:09:01,585
史波克先生…他们真的相信伊甸的存在吗？
Mr. Spock... do they really believe that Eden exists?

136
00:09:02,438 --> 00:09:06,257
许多神话都是基于真理的，舰长，它们并非无知
Many myths are based on truth, Captain, and they are not unintelligent.

137
00:09:06,677 --> 00:09:08,483
他们的领袖塞夫林博士，他是…

138

塞夫林博士是他们的领袖？

139
00:09:10,201 --> 00:09:14,533
是的，迪布隆星上的一位杰出的研究工程师

140
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:17,240
专攻声学、通讯和电子领域

141
00:09:17,926 --> 00:09:20,976
当他发起这项运动时，他被免职
He was dismissed from his post when he started this movement.

142
00:09:21,862 --> 00:09:26,480
汤戈·拉德继承了父亲在空间研究领域的才能
Tong Rad inherits his father's extraordinary abilities in the field of space studies.

143
00:09:29,317 --> 00:09:35,728
但是他们拒绝了这些技术及其带来的一切
But they've rejected all that and all that this technology provides.

144
00:09:36,268 --> 00:09:37,330
他们寻求本原
And they seek the primitive.

145
00:09:38,548 --> 00:09:44,104
有很多人对我们创造的东西感到不舒服
There are many who are uncomfortable with what we have created.

146
00:09:44,733 --> 00:09:46,805
这几乎是一种生物反抗
It is almost a biological rebellion.

147
00:09:47,149 --> 00:09:50,355
一种对计划好的社区
A profound revulsion against the planned communities,

148
00:09:50,612 --> 00:09:55,495
设计好的，无菌的，巧妙平衡的大气的方案

149
00:09:56,367 --> 00:10:00,807
他们渴望春天来临的伊甸
They hunger for an Eden where spring comes.

150
00:10:01,507 --> 00:10:05,222
所有人都渴望，这深深地印在在我们记忆深处
All do. The cave is deep in our memory.

151
00:10:05,899 --> 00:10:07,962
是的，没错，舰长
Yes, that is true, Captain.

152
00:10:08,183 --> 00:10:12,727
但我们不会偷太空巡洋舰，也不会像不负责任的孩子一样行事
But we don't steal space cruisers and act like irresponsible children.

153
00:10:13,368 --> 00:10:14,776
是什么让你对他们如此同情？
What makes you so sympathetic toward them?

154
00:10:15,329 --> 00:10:19,747
与其说是同情，不如说是好奇，舰长
It is not sympathy, so much as curiosity, Captain.

155
00:10:20,141 --> 00:10:21,892
想了解的愿望
A wish to understand.

156
00:10:22,102 --> 00:10:25,878
他们认为自己与他们的世界格格不入
They regard themselves as aliens in their own worlds,

157
00:10:26,662 --> 00:10:29,734
这样的处境我有点熟悉
a condition with which I am somewhat familiar.

158
00:10:37,533 --> 00:10:38,158
史波克
Spock.

159
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:42,378
赫伯特是什么意思？
What does Herbert mean?

160
00:10:43,344 --> 00:10:49,744
这个词有点不中听，舰长
It is somewhat uncomplimentary, Captain.

161
00:10:50,212 --> 00:10:52,544
赫伯特是个小官
Herbert was a minor official

162
00:10:53,859 --> 00:10:59,264
因其僵化和有限的思维模式而臭名昭著
notorious for his rigid and limited patterns of thought.

163
00:11:02,447 --> 00:11:04,448
好吧，我会尽量不那么死板地思考
Well, I shall try to be less rigid in my thinking.

00:12:22,194 --> 00:12:23,186
她正在体检

哈哈哈
Ha ha ha.

183
00:12:31,163 --> 00:12:31,877
你认识伊琳娜？
You know Irina?

00:12:32,432 --> 00:12:34,494
告诉我，你为什么穿那么些衣服？
Tell me, why do you wear all those clothes?

185
00:12:35,218 --> 00:12:35,927
你怎么呼吸？

187
00:12:39,636 --> 00:12:40,414

You're next.

188
00:12:52,501 --> 00:12:53,166
伊琳娜…
Irina...

189
00:12:53,845 --> 00:12:55,125
帕维尔·安德烈维奇
Pavel Andreievich.

190
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:58,560
我想过我们可能会相遇
I had thought we might encounter each other.

191
00:12:59,341 --> 00:13:01,326
你知道我在企业号上吗？
You knew I was on the Enterprise?

192
00:13:01,847 --> 00:13:02,402
我听说过
I had heard.

193
00:13:03,419 --> 00:13:06,190
伊琳娜，为什么…
Irina, why...

194
00:13:11,867 --> 00:13:12,398
来
Come.

195
00:13:18,595 --> 00:13:20,028
你怎么能这样对自己？
How could you do this to yourself?

196
00:13:20,499 --> 00:13:23,116
你本是个科学家，现在看看你
You were a scientist. And now look at you.

197
00:13:23,568 --> 00:13:24,708
看看你自己，帕维尔
Look at yourself, Pavel.

198
00:13:26,934 --> 00:13:27,683
你为什么要那么做？
Why did you do it?

199
00:13:28,035 --> 00:13:28,798
你又是为什么？
Why did you?

200
00:13:33,419 --> 00:13:34,443
我为自己感到自豪
I'm proud of what I am.

201
00:13:35,248 --> 00:13:36,336
我相信我所做的
I believe in what I do.

202
00:13:37,921 --> 00:13:38,570
你能这么说吗？
Can you say that?

203
00:13:38,659 --> 00:13:39,175
是的
Yes.

204
00:13:41,386 --> 00:13:43,361
我们不应该这样针锋相对，帕维尔
We should not tear at each other so, Pavel.

205
00:13:44,301 --> 00:13:46,029
我们应该在欢乐中重逢
We should meet again in joy.

206
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:50,598
今天，当我第一次知道跟着我们的是你的船时，我想起了你…
Today when I first knew it was your ship that followed us, I thought of you...

207
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:52,626
并想知道我会发现什么
and wondered what I would find.

208
00:13:55,204 --> 00:13:57,124
我回忆起了很多
And I remembered so much.

209
00:14:00,866 --> 00:14:05,833
尽管穿着那件制服，我看到的还是以前认识的那个帕维尔
In spite of that uniform, I still see the same Pavel I used to know.

210
00:14:11,247 --> 00:14:12,586
你对你所做的事情感到快乐吗？
Are you happy in what you do?

211
00:14:14,138 --> 00:14:14,832
是的
Yes.

212
00:14:17,113 --> 00:14:18,713
那么我接受你的所作所为
Then I accept what you do.

213
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:21,079
你甚至像他们一样说话
You even talk like them.

214
00:14:27,673 --> 00:14:28,814
你为什么离开？
Why did you go away?

215
00:14:29,532 --> 00:14:31,198
离开的是你
It was you who went.

216
00:14:31,436 --> 00:14:32,978
我回去找你了
I came back to look for you.

217
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:34,718
我找过了
I looked.

218
00:14:36,721 --> 00:14:37,646
你去哪儿了？
Where did you go?

219
00:14:38,486 --> 00:14:42,382
我留在了城市，和朋友们
I stayed in the city. With friends.

220
00:14:45,878 --> 00:14:47,633
你从来没有感同身受过，从没
You never felt as I did. Never.

221
00:14:48,337 --> 00:14:49,141
我当然有
I did.

222
00:14:49,428 --> 00:14:51,610
你没有感觉到那么多
You don't have it in you to feel so much.

223
00:14:52,442 --> 00:14:54,708
即使我们很亲近，你内心也没有和我在一起
Even when we were close, you weren't with me.

224
00:14:55,665 --> 00:14:57,678
你在神游，在想别的事情
You were off, thinking of something else.

225
00:14:59,854 --> 00:15:01,461
你为什么躲着我？
Why did you stay away?

226
00:15:03,882 --> 00:15:05,789
因为你不赞成我
Because you disapproved of me.

227
00:15:07,118 --> 00:15:08,362
就像你现在一样
Just as you do now.

228
00:15:11,981 --> 00:15:14,404
哦，帕维尔，你一直都是这样
Oh, Pavel, you have always been like this.

229
00:15:15,219 --> 00:15:19,728
那么正确，而内心，充满挣扎
So correct. And inside, the struggle not to be.

230
00:15:20,177 --> 00:15:24,336
听从你的内心，你会更快乐，你会明白的
Give in to yourself. You will be happier. You'll see.

231
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:30,886
去找你的朋友
Go to your friends.

232
00:15:47,009 --> 00:15:48,802
[人群大喊]
[PEOPLE SHOUTING]

233
00:15:49,994 --> 00:15:53,346
释放塞夫林博士！释放塞夫林博士！
Free Dr. Sevrin !Free Dr. Sevrin !

234
00:15:58,447 --> 00:15:59,775
我们想马上见他！
We want to see him right now!

235
00:16:00,385 --> 00:16:01,985
但我们现在想见他！
But we want to see him now!

236
00:16:07,905 --> 00:16:10,657
一起唱：赫伯特！赫伯特！赫伯特！
ALL CHANT: Herbert! Herbert! Herbert!

237
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,849
我以为所有动物都被关在笼子里
I thought all the animals were kept in cages.

238
00:16:13,147 --> 00:16:13,836
怎么了，老骨头？
What's going on, Bones?

239
00:16:15,938 --> 00:16:18,248
麻烦，这位朋友不想做检查
Trouble. Friend here didn't want a checkup.

240
00:16:18,273 --> 00:16:19,329
原来是有原因的
Turns out there's a reason.

241
00:16:19,835 --> 00:16:21,228
我不接受你的发现
I refuse to accept your findings.

242
00:16:21,263 --> 00:16:22,448
你没有选择
You don't have the choice.

243
00:16:22,562 --> 00:16:24,432
它们是偏见的产物，不是科学
They are the product of prejudice, not science.

244
00:16:24,728 --> 00:16:27,609
我不知道这个人打算在一个原始星球上做什么
I don't know what this man was planning on doing on a primitive planet,

245
00:16:27,703 --> 00:16:29,171
但假设有这么一个星球存在
but assuming one did exist,

246
00:16:29,443 --> 00:16:31,104
我可以告诉你，如果他在那里定居，会发生什么
I can tell you what would have happened had he settled there.

247
00:16:31,104 --> 00:16:32,115
毫无根据
Untrue.

248
00:16:32,859 --> 00:16:35,140
原住民活下来的人手甚至不够去埋死人
Wouldn't have been enough of those primitives left to bury their dead.

249
00:16:35,428 --> 00:16:37,143
都是想象，臆测
Fantasy. Fantasy.

250
00:16:37,143 --> 00:16:38,011
我倒希望是
I wish it were.

251
00:16:39,007 --> 00:16:41,575
一个讨厌的小虫子在过去几年进化了，吉姆
A nasty little bug evolved in the last few years, Jim.

252
00:16:42,111 --> 00:16:44,714
我们洁净，无菌的文明产生了它
Our aseptic, sterilized civilizations produced it.

253
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,069
新合成球菌，这是致命的
Synthococcus novae. It's deadly.

254
00:16:47,123 --> 00:16:50,291
我们能对它免疫，但我们还没有学会应对它的所有问题
We can immunize against it, but haven't learned to lick all the problems yet.

255
00:16:51,281 --> 00:16:52,494
他有吗？其他人呢？
Does he have it? And the others?

256
00:16:53,742 --> 00:16:55,938
其他人很干净，他没有感染，他是一个携带者
Well, the others are clear. He doesn't have it. He's a carrier.

257
00:16:56,077 --> 00:16:57,907
还记得你的古代历史，伤寒玛丽吗？
Remember your ancient history? Typhoid Mary?

258
00:16:58,070 --> 00:16:59,553
他对它免疫，就像她一样
He's immune to it, as she was,

259
00:16:59,642 --> 00:17:02,241
但他携带疾病并传播给其他人
but he carries the disease and spreads to others.

260
00:17:02,795 --> 00:17:03,554
船员有危险吗？
Is the crew in danger?

261
00:17:04,248 --> 00:17:04,892
我不知道
I don't know.

262
00:17:04,947 --> 00:17:07,506
他们都进行了全谱免疫接种
They all had full spectrum immunizations before boarding.

263
00:17:07,673 --> 00:17:09,910
我猜是他的朋友们也接种过
My guess is his friends have had shots too.

264
00:17:10,192 --> 00:17:12,517
但定期的加强注射是必要的
But a regular program of booster shots is necessary.

265
00:17:13,068 --> 00:17:15,219
我得检查船上的每个人，可能会有遗漏
I'll have to check everyone on the ship, there could be some skips.

266
00:17:15,274 --> 00:17:17,971
同时，他应该被完全隔离
In the meantime, he should be placed in total isolation.

267
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:19,568
这太离谱了
This is outrageous.

268
00:17:20,391 --> 00:17:22,473
你不是在隔离我，而是在囚禁我
You're not isolating me. You're imprisoning me.

269
00:17:23,226 --> 00:17:25,884
你捏造了罪名，认定我有罪，判我刑！
You invent a crime, find me guilty and sentence me!

270
00:17:25,953 --> 00:17:27,594
你想自己进行测试吗，博士？
Would you like to run the test yourself, Doctor?

271
00:17:27,594 --> 00:17:30,133
你上船前就知道你是一个携带者，不是吗？
You knew you were a carrier before you came aboard, didn't you?

272
00:17:30,153 --> 00:17:30,612
不！
No!

273
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:32,418
那你为什么拒绝检查？
Then why did you fight the examination?

274
00:17:32,567 --> 00:17:33,990
它侵犯了我的权利
It was an infringement on my rights!

275
00:17:34,283 --> 00:17:35,165
把他隔离起来
Put him in isolation.

276
00:17:47,099 --> 00:17:49,920
准备接受反对意见，吉姆，他们有一大帮人
Be ready for the objections, Jim. They are a vocal lot.

277
00:17:49,969 --> 00:17:50,991
是的，我准备好了
Yes, I'm ready.

278
00:17:51,586 --> 00:17:52,546
柯克呼叫警卫
Kirk to security.

279
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:57,117
我想要一个看守塞夫林博士，直到另行通知
I want a guard maintained on Dr. Sevrin until further notice.

280
00:17:58,492 --> 00:18:02,978
老骨头，我们还要多久才能知道船员是否受到这种感染的威胁？
Bones, how long before we know whether the crew's been endangered by this infection?

281
00:18:03,068 --> 00:18:05,628
它会在24小时内显示，这是一种致命的菌株
It'll show in 24 hours. It's a virulent strain.

282
00:18:10,941 --> 00:18:12,290
你和他们不是一起的
You don't belong with them.

283
00:18:12,602 --> 00:18:13,767
你知道我们想要什么
You know what we want.

284
00:18:14,293 --> 00:18:17,429
你也想要，来，加入我们
You want it, too. Come, join us.

285
00:18:18,327 --> 00:18:19,493
你怎么知道我想要什么？
How do you know what I want?

286
00:18:19,895 --> 00:18:20,847
你很年轻
You're young.

287
00:18:22,039 --> 00:18:23,915
想想年轻吧，兄弟
Think young, brother.

288
00:18:24,082 --> 00:18:26,126
你让它很诱人
You make it tempting.

没有解释，长官
No explanation, sir.

我们会释放塞夫林博士，只要我们认为他在医学上是安全的

00:19:04,223 --> 00:19:05,007
是的，斯科提，怎么了？
Yes, Scotty, what is it?

299
00:19:05,066 --> 00:19:09,544
我把一个你称之为打赤脚的人从这里赶了出去
Captain, I just had to give one of those barefooted what do you call 'ems the boot out of here.

300
00:19:09,711 --> 00:19:12,572
她大摇大摆地走进来，试图煽动我的船员不满
She came in bold as brass, tried to incite my crew to disaffect.

301
00:19:12,815 --> 00:19:13,738
谢谢，斯科提
Thank you, Scotty.

302
00:19:14,982 --> 00:19:17,679
史波克先生，我似乎无法与这些人沟通
Mr. Spock, I don't seem to be able to communicate with these people.

303
00:19:17,744 --> 00:19:20,604
你认为你能说服他们规矩点吗？
Do you think you can persuade them to behave?

304
00:19:21,422 --> 00:19:22,533
我会尝试的，舰长
I shall make an attempt, Captain.

305
00:19:22,711 --> 00:19:23,415
谢谢，史波克先生
Thank you, Mr Spock.

306
00:19:23,425 --> 00:19:25,119
要不是那个大使的儿子
If it weren't for that ambassador's son,

307
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:26,780
他们都会在禁闭室里
they'd all be in the brig.

308
00:19:26,861 --> 00:19:27,461
是的，长官
Yes, sir.

309
00:19:28,586 --> 00:19:31,274
[柯克]舰长日志，星历5832.5
[KIRK] Captain's log, stardate 5832.5.

310
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:37,180
塞夫林博士追随者的傲慢正在企业号上造成无法忍受的局面
The arrogance of Dr. Sevrin and his followers is creating an intolerable situation aboard the Enterprise.

311
00:19:37,525 --> 00:19:39,667
如果持续下去，我将被迫使用控制装置
If it continues, I'll be forced to use controls

312
00:19:39,692 --> 00:19:42,102
那可能有悖于星际舰队的建议
which might not agree with Starfleet's suggestion

313
00:19:42,493 --> 00:19:45,373
即以极端宽容的态度处理它们
that they be handled with extreme tolerance.

314
00:19:45,865 --> 00:19:47,785
他们的行为不是我指使的
I have no influence over what they do.

315
00:19:48,839 --> 00:19:51,389
他们尊重你，他们会听你的理由
They respect you. They will listen to your reasoning.

316
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,462
为他们起见，你必须阻止他们
For their sake, you must stop them.

317
00:19:57,114 --> 00:20:00,277
塞夫林博士，我有能力帮助你和你的团队
Dr. Sevrin, I am in a position to help you and your group.

318
00:20:00,912 --> 00:20:02,960
我可以使用企业号的资源
I can use the resources of the Enterprise

319
00:20:03,465 --> 00:20:06,618
确定伊甸是否真的存在
to determine whether or not Eden actually exists

320
00:20:07,015 --> 00:20:08,807
并绘制其确切位置
and to plot its exact location.

321
00:20:09,639 --> 00:20:13,991
我可以向联邦提出申请，允许你们团队在该星球上进行殖民
I can present a case to Federation to allow your group to colonize that planet.

322
00:20:15,944 --> 00:20:19,243
你和你的人目前都没有被指控犯罪
Neither you nor your people are at present charged with a crime.

323
00:20:20,307 --> 00:20:25,339
然而，煽动不满是犯罪行为
However, incitement to disaffection is criminal.

324
00:20:25,736 --> 00:20:28,735
联邦绝不允许犯罪分子对一个星球进行殖民
The Federation will never allow the colonization of a planet by criminals.

325
00:20:29,048 --> 00:20:33,848
如果他们一直这样，他们将被指控并永远被禁止进入伊甸
If they persist, they will be so charged and for ever barred from Eden.

326
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:35,721
像我一样被禁止
As I have been barred.

327
00:20:36,846 --> 00:20:38,390
那你知道你是一个携带者
Then you knew you were a carrier.

328
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:40,848
我当然知道
Of course I knew.

329
00:20:43,822 --> 00:20:45,577
你已经调查了我的生活
You've researched my life.

330
00:20:46,499 --> 00:20:50,590
你读过限制我只能在先进技术地区出行的命令
You've read the orders restricting me to travel only in areas of advanced technology

331
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:52,613
因为我携带的东西
because of what my body carries.

332
00:20:53,138 --> 00:20:56,019
我不明白的是你为什么不服从这些命令
What I fail to understand is why you disobey those orders.

333
00:20:56,943 --> 00:20:59,692
因为这对我来说是毒药！
Because this is poison to me!

334
00:21:03,346 --> 00:21:09,167
这…你呼吸的东西，你生活的东西
This... stuff you breath, this stuff you live in.

335
00:21:11,274 --> 00:21:15,691
我们在每个星球上铺设的人工大气防护罩
Shields of artificial atmosphere that we have layered about every planet.

336
00:21:18,651 --> 00:21:23,703
那些为你们运行飞船和生活的电脑程序
The programs in those computers that run your ship and your lives for you,

337
00:21:24,814 --> 00:21:27,694
它们培养了我身体携带的东西
they bred what my body carries.

338
00:21:30,491 --> 00:21:32,795
这就是你的科学对我所做的
That's what your science has done to me.

339
00:21:35,761 --> 00:21:37,164
你已经感染了我
You've infected me.

340
00:21:43,024 --> 00:21:45,328
只有原始可以净化我
Only the primitives can cleanse me.

341
00:21:46,346 --> 00:21:48,587
在我加入他们之前，我无法净化自己
I cannot purge myself until I am among them.

342
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:53,875
只有他们的生活方式是正确的，我必须去找他们
Only their way of living is right. I must go to them.

343
00:21:54,179 --> 00:21:56,882
你的存在会摧毁你寻找的人
Your very presence will destroy the people you seek.

344
00:21:58,255 --> 00:21:59,407
你肯定知道的
Surely you know that.

345
00:22:00,744 --> 00:22:02,728
我要到他们那里去，与他们合而为一
I shall go to them and be One with them.

346
00:22:04,447 --> 00:22:08,415
我们将一起建立一个银河系从未见过的世界
And together we shall build a world such as this galaxy has never seen.

347
00:22:09,475 --> 00:22:12,035
一个世界，一种生活
A world. A life.

348
00:22:14,046 --> 00:22:15,198
一种生活
A life.

349
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:26,520
现在你要试着说服我
So now you're gonna try to persuade me

350
00:22:26,604 --> 00:22:29,256
你的技术会为我找到治疗方法
that your technologies will find a cure for me,

351
00:22:29,286 --> 00:22:30,352
然后我就可以走了
and then I'll be free to go.

352
00:22:31,492 --> 00:22:32,375
是的，博士
Yes, Doctor.

353
00:22:34,011 --> 00:22:36,768
因此，我应该说服我的朋友们守规矩，
And for that reason I should persuade my friends to behave 

354
00:22:36,797 --> 00:22:38,270
这样他们也将被允许进入伊甸
so that they, too, will be allowed.

355
00:22:38,716 --> 00:22:39,522
是的，博士
Yes, Doctor.

356
00:22:43,595 --> 00:22:46,552
好的，你让他们进来，我会和他们谈谈
All right. You send them in. I'll talk to them.

357
00:22:56,366 --> 00:23:00,010
塞夫林博士疯了
Dr. Sevrin is insane.

358
00:23:01,245 --> 00:23:04,125
我还没咨询过麦考伊医生，但我对此毫不怀疑
I have not consulted Dr. McCoy, but I have no doubt of it.

359
00:23:04,606 --> 00:23:05,694
我会让老骨头检查他
I'll have Bones check him out.

360
00:23:08,255 --> 00:23:10,000
史波克，抱歉，你对他非常尊重
Spock, I'm sorry. You had great respect for him.

361
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:13,455
但它确实解释了他们做了什么
But it does explain some of what they've done.

362
00:23:14,091 --> 00:23:17,547
他的病情不影响我对运动的兴趣
His condition does not affect my interest in the movement.

363
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:20,636
他们寻求的东西并不疯狂
There is no insanity in what they seek.

364
00:23:22,271 --> 00:23:25,343
我做出了一个承诺，我想遵守
I made a promise which I should like to keep.

365
00:23:26,644 --> 00:23:30,055
要是你允许，我必须找到伊甸
With your permission, I must locate Eden.

366
00:23:31,944 --> 00:23:33,461
我将在我的宿舍工作
I shall work in my quarters.

367
00:23:33,684 --> 00:23:36,808
我可以在辅助控制上得到契科夫先生的帮助吗？
May I have the assistance of Mr. Chekov in auxiliary control?

368
00:23:38,969 --> 00:23:39,673
当然
Certainly.

369
00:23:41,413 --> 00:23:42,878
契科夫先生，协助史波克先生
Mr. Chekov, assist Mr. Spock.

370
00:23:45,107 --> 00:23:47,120
舰桥呼叫医务室，我是麦考伊
Bridge to Sickbay.  McCoy here.

371
00:23:47,333 --> 00:23:47,913
老骨头
Bones,

372
00:23:48,424 --> 00:23:49,183
什么事，舰长
Yes, Captain.

373
00:23:49,966 --> 00:23:50,690
我想和你谈谈
I'd like to talk to you.

374
00:23:52,822 --> 00:23:55,038
[柯克]舰长日志，星历5832.6
[KIRK] Captain's log, stardate 5832.6.

375
00:23:55,593 --> 00:23:58,270
我已要求麦考伊医生查看星舰医疗记录
I have asked Dr. McCoy to check Starfleet medical records

376
00:23:58,315 --> 00:24:01,676
验证史波克先生的怀疑，塞夫林博士疯了
to verify Mr. Spock's suspicion that Dr. Sevrin is insane.

377
00:24:02,113 --> 00:24:05,231
尽管塞夫林博士很反感我们，他还是答应了史波克先生
In spite of Dr. Sevrin 's antipathy to us, he has promised Mr. Spock

378
00:24:05,291 --> 00:24:08,969
他的追随者会遵守我们的规则
that he will order his disciples to conform to our rules and regulations.

379
00:24:09,311 --> 00:24:10,273
[门声]
[DOOR BUZZES]

380
00:24:10,442 --> 00:24:11,105
进来
Come in.

381
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:14,418
我打扰你了吗？
Am I crossing you?

382
00:24:15,910 --> 00:24:16,614
没有
No.

383
00:24:17,685 --> 00:24:18,831
我只是在想…
I was just thinking...

384
00:24:19,019 --> 00:24:20,249
嘿，兄弟，你玩吗？
Hey, brother, do you play?

385
00:24:21,989 --> 00:24:22,648
是瓦肯人的吗？
Is it Vulcan?

386
00:24:23,967 --> 00:24:24,582
我可以试试吗？
Can I try it?

387
00:24:35,167 --> 00:24:36,895
@嗬嗬，就是现在
Ho ho, that's now!

388
00:24:37,656 --> 00:24:38,999
现在是真的了
That's real now.

389
00:24:43,699 --> 00:24:45,796
我明白了，兄弟，我真的明白了
I reach that, brother. I really do.

390
00:24:47,785 --> 00:24:48,376
给
Give.

391
00:25:13,783 --> 00:25:17,879
嘿，你和我们来一场演奏会怎么样？会很棒的
Hey, how about a session, you and us? It would sound.

392
00:25:18,791 --> 00:25:20,348
这就是我来的目的，我说
That's what I came for. I wanted to ask,

393
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:23,323
我本来想问楼上的大白舰长的，但他不理解我们
you know, great white captain upstairs, but he don't reach us.

394
00:25:24,127 --> 00:25:26,463
但，呃，他会同意开演奏会吗？我是说
But, uh, would he shake on a session? I mean,

395
00:25:26,902 --> 00:25:28,994
我们想合作，就像你要求的那样，所以我问问
We want to cooperate, like you ask, so I'm asking.

396
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:31,880
如果我理解正确
If I understand you correctly,

397
00:25:32,693 --> 00:25:35,217
我相信答案可能是肯定的
I believe the answer might be yes.

398
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:38,771
我去传话
I'll spread the word.

399
00:25:48,876 --> 00:25:49,832
我可以进去吗？
Am I allowed in?

400
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:51,771
是的
Yes.

401
00:25:52,758 --> 00:25:54,397
我一直在找你，帕维尔
I have been looking for you, Pavel.

402
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,157
这是什么房间？
What room is this?

403
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:02,539
辅助控制室
Auxiliary control.

404
00:26:04,835 --> 00:26:05,795
干什么的？
What's it for?

405
00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:09,172
如果主控制室故障或损坏
Should the main control room break down or suffer damage,

406
00:26:09,238 --> 00:26:10,838
我们可以在这里操控这艘船
we can navigate the ship from here.

407
00:26:16,545 --> 00:26:17,830
你想干什么？
What do you want?

408
00:26:19,505 --> 00:26:23,966
道歉，我不应该取笑你的，那太伤人了
To apologize. I should not have teased you. It was cruel.

409
00:26:25,797 --> 00:26:26,565
没关系
It does not matter.

410
00:26:26,615 --> 00:26:27,653
哦，有关系
Oh, but it does.

411
00:26:28,851 --> 00:26:30,720
它违背了我所相信的一切
It is against everything I believe in.

412
00:26:32,668 --> 00:26:35,202
让我们不要讨论你的信仰
Let us not discuss your beliefs.

413
00:26:36,456 --> 00:26:38,931
而且我不喜欢你生我的气
And I do not like having you angry with me,

414
00:26:40,279 --> 00:26:41,439
或者不赞成我
or disapproving.

415
00:26:42,812 --> 00:26:44,399
那你为什么要做这样的事情？
Then why do you do such things?

416
00:26:48,122 --> 00:26:49,446
你在做什么？
What are you working on?

417
00:26:51,622 --> 00:26:56,382
我正在协助史波克先生找到你的伊甸
I am assisting Mr. Spock in locating your Eden.

418
00:26:58,975 --> 00:27:00,507
哦，现在是你在取笑我
Oh, now you are teasing me.

419
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:03,828
我没有
I am not.

420
00:27:04,721 --> 00:27:06,650
这些磁带包含星图
These tapes contain star charts

421
00:27:06,833 --> 00:27:09,327
我们在这里投影不同行星的轨道
and we project the orbits of the various planets here.

422
00:27:12,450 --> 00:27:14,736
呃，通过数学过程，我们确定
Uh, by mathematical process, we determine

423
00:27:14,815 --> 00:27:19,843
它们是否受到尚未绘制的其他天体的影响
whether or not they are affected by other bodies not yet charted.

424
00:27:22,961 --> 00:27:24,523
你知道所有这些东西？
Do you know all these things?

425
00:27:27,146 --> 00:27:30,538
要是有不知道的就去电脑库里查
What I do not know I find out from the computer banks.

426
00:27:31,246 --> 00:27:34,741
如果…我什么都不知道
If... I knew nothing at all,

427
00:27:35,118 --> 00:27:38,581
我可以通过学习储存在那里面的东西来操纵这艘飞船
I could navigate the ship simply by studying what is stored in there.

428
00:27:43,943 --> 00:27:47,294
它们包含了所有人类知识的总和
They contain the sum of all human knowledge.

429
00:27:48,355 --> 00:27:52,195
它们解决我们在导航
They solve our problems of navigation.

430
00:27:53,170 --> 00:27:54,905
控制
of control,

431
00:27:56,112 --> 00:27:58,182
生命支持方面的问题
of life support.

432
00:27:59,243 --> 00:28:02,443
它们告诉你们该做什么，你们就按照它们的吩咐去做
They tell you what to do and you do what they tell you.

433
00:28:03,695 --> 00:28:07,617
不，我们也用自己的判断
No. We use our own judgment also.

434
00:28:09,362 --> 00:28:11,457
我永远无法听从电脑
I could never obey a computer.

435
00:28:13,259 --> 00:28:16,303
你永远不听任何人的话
You could never listen to anyone.

436
00:28:17,716 --> 00:28:21,563
你总是必须与众不同
You always had to be different.

437
00:28:22,466 --> 00:28:25,851
不一样，是我想成为的
Not different. What I wanted to be.

438
00:28:27,493 --> 00:28:30,053
做你想做的事并没有错
There is nothing wrong in doing what you want.

439
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:39,774
[通讯器发出哔哔声]
[COMMUNICATOR BLEEPS]

440
00:28:40,284 --> 00:28:41,950
史波克[通过对讲机]：我没有收到，契科夫先生
SPOCK [OVER INTERCOM] : I am not receiving, Mr. Chekov.

441
00:28:43,923 --> 00:28:46,931
史波克呼叫契科夫，重复，我没有收到
Spock to Chekov. Repeat. I am not receiving.

442
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,843
对不起，史波克先生
I am sorry, Mr. Spock.

443
00:28:57,751 --> 00:29:01,013
我被一时耽搁了
I was momentarily delayed.

444
00:29:07,964 --> 00:29:10,498
他叫苏鲁，武器和导航专家
His name is Sulu, specialist in weapons and navigation.

445
00:29:10,686 --> 00:29:11,633
他的爱好是植物学
His hobby is botany.

446
00:29:11,906 --> 00:29:12,406
可能吗？
Can?

447
00:29:12,605 --> 00:29:15,191
可能，我懂植物学，它是我最喜欢的研究
Can. I reach botany. It's my favorite of studies.

448
00:29:15,708 --> 00:29:16,150
你的呢？
What's yours?

449
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:17,196
瓦肯人
Vulcan.

450
00:29:17,527 --> 00:29:19,689
史波克现在几乎是一了
Spock is practically One now.

451
00:29:25,148 --> 00:29:27,399
所有东西都可以通过辅助控制进行处理
Everything can be handled from auxiliary control.

452
00:29:27,667 --> 00:29:30,099
计算机包含我们需要的所有信息
The computers contain all the information we need.

453
00:29:30,319 --> 00:29:31,048
我们能做到
We can do it.

454
00:29:31,182 --> 00:29:32,307
演出即将开始！
It starts to chime!

455

什么时候？
When will it?

456
00:29:33,041 --> 00:29:34,563
很快，就像他说的，现在
Soonest. Like he said, now.

457
00:29:34,856 --> 00:29:37,547
我们应该都出去尽可能地热热场
We should all go out and try to swing as many as possible over.

458
00:29:37,714 --> 00:29:39,486
你有什么特别的方法让他们摇摆起来吗？
You suggest any special ways to swing them?

459
00:29:39,843 --> 00:29:40,810
只要友好一点
Just be friendly.

460
00:29:41,807 --> 00:29:42,986
你知道如何友好相处
You know how to be friendly.

461
00:29:46,566 --> 00:29:47,591
那么他们就会很友好
Then they'll be friendly.

至少我们知道他们在哪里，他们在做什么

他们是麻烦精

I used to get into little trouble when I was that age, Scotty, didn't you?

492
00:34:36,414 --> 00:34:38,818
舰长，我没有收到控制器的响应
Captain, I get no response on controls.

493
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:41,102
我们正在偏离航线
We're going off course.

494
00:34:42,016 --> 00:34:42,892
短路了
It's shorted.

495
00:34:44,113 --> 00:34:46,476
不，它被接到了什么地方
No, it's channeled over somewhere.

舰长，似乎好像有人在操纵这艘船
Captain, it seems as though someone else is running the ship.

500
00:34:58,159 --> 00:35:01,024
塞夫林[通过对讲机]没错，有人正在操控这艘船
SEVRIN [OVER INTERCOM] That's right. Someone else is running the ship.

501
00:35:02,175 --> 00:35:02,879

I am.

502
00:35:04,089 --> 00:35:07,417

You cannot interfere, as I have frozen the doors to the control room.

504
00:35:11,605 --> 00:35:15,531
在我们到达伊甸之前，我不打算将掌舵权交给你
I do not intend to hand over the helm to you until and unless we reach Eden.

505
00:35:16,206 --> 00:35:19,430
如果我被阻止到达那个目的地
And if I am in any way prevented from reaching that destination,

506
00:35:19,488 --> 00:35:22,309
我会摧毁这艘船和船上的所有人
I shall destroy this ship and all aboard.

507
00:35:23,132 --> 00:35:23,796
他能这么做吗？
Can he do it?

508
00:35:24,342 --> 00:35:25,564
他有这个能力，舰长
He has the capability, Captain.

509
00:35:25,853 --> 00:35:27,467
[斯科特]他拦截了所有东西
[SCOTT] He's got everything channeled over.

See if you can bypass him.

512
00:35:30,499 --> 00:35:32,026
你试试，我会回敬的
Do that, and I shall retaliate.

513
00:35:32,448 --> 00:35:33,818
[塞夫林]我不会再警告你了
[SERVIN] I shall not warn you again.

514
00:35:34,049 --> 00:35:35,672
舰长，我们正离开中立区
Captain, we're now leaving the neutral zone.

515
00:35:36,677 --> 00:35:37,881
驶入罗慕伦空间
Bearing into Romulan space.

516
00:35:43,747 --> 00:35:44,643
有巡逻队吗？
Any patrols?

517
00:35:46,171 --> 00:35:46,870
没有
Negative.

518
00:35:47,034 --> 00:35:48,020
很快就会有的
There will be soon.

519
00:35:51,441 --> 00:35:57,690
塞夫林博士，你正在侵犯罗慕伦空间并危及星系和平
Dr. Sevrin, you are violating Romulan space and endangering the peace of the galaxy.

520
00:35:58,288 --> 00:36:01,616
罗慕伦人会将此视为军事入侵并攻击
The Romulans will view this as a military intrusion and attack.

521
00:36:02,592 --> 00:36:03,970
现在让飞船掉头
Bring the ship about now.

522
00:36:04,307 --> 00:36:08,541
如果你让她掉头并返回星际基地，不会有任何指控
If you bring her about and return to Starbase, no charges will be leveled.

523
00:36:09,106 --> 00:36:10,514
就像你说的，塞弗林兄弟
Like you said, Brother Sevrin.

524
00:36:13,886 --> 00:36:17,133
否则，您将永远无法到达伊甸
If you do not, you will never reach Eden.

525
00:36:17,758 --> 00:36:19,501
你和这艘船将被摧毁
You and this ship will be destroyed.

526
00:36:19,855 --> 00:36:22,463
[亚当]他很忐忑，真的害怕了
[ADAM] He's got jelly in the belly. Real scared.

527
00:36:25,224 --> 00:36:30,984
亚当，拉德，你被一个疯子领导
Adam, Rad, you are being led by a man who is insane.

528
00:36:32,745 --> 00:36:34,104
你被他利用了
You are being used by him.

529
00:36:39,518 --> 00:36:42,103
史波克，你告诉他们
Spock, you tell them.

530
00:36:45,348 --> 00:36:49,835
亚当，我们的电脑库里有一份关于赛夫林博士的档案
Adam, there is a file on Dr. Sevrin in our computer banks.

531
00:36:50,197 --> 00:36:52,716
里面是一份证明事实的报告
In it is a report attesting to the fact

532
00:36:52,939 --> 00:36:57,484
他是一种被称为新合成球菌的芽孢杆菌菌株的携带者。
that he is a carrier of a bacillus strain known as Synthococcus novae.

533
00:36:58,100 --> 00:36:59,508
真可怕啊！
Ain't that just awful?

534
00:37:02,562 --> 00:37:04,451
你也会发现来自同一家医院的报告
You'll also find a report from the same hospital

535
00:37:04,525 --> 00:37:06,544
提供他的完整的心理学档案
giving a full psychological profile on him

536
00:37:07,431 --> 00:37:09,558
并投射了他的这些行为
and projecting these actions of his.

537
00:37:09,756 --> 00:37:10,762
是的，兄弟
Yay, brother.

538
00:37:11,556 --> 00:37:14,342
亚当，你知道我理解你
Adam, you know I reach you.

539
00:37:15,238 --> 00:37:16,742
我相信你所寻求的
I believe in what you seek.

540
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:22,929
但是，你想要的和他想要的东西有着悲剧性的差异
But there is a tragic difference between what you want and what he wants.

541
00:37:23,281 --> 00:37:24,753
你要把我弄哭了
You're making me cry.

542
00:37:28,710 --> 00:37:32,117
在那里，他们建立了伊甸，塞夫林兄弟
There it is. They've established Eden, Brother Sevrin.

543
00:37:32,627 --> 00:37:33,737
帕维尔说他们会的
Pavel said they would.

544
00:37:34,327 --> 00:37:36,724
我们原来的航线一定是错误的
Our original course must have been in error.

545
00:37:37,233 --> 00:37:38,193
我们什么时候到那里？
When will we get there?

546
00:37:38,313 --> 00:37:39,657
以这个速度，三个小时
At this speed, three hours.

547
00:37:41,189 --> 00:37:44,273
他们会试图说服我们立即改变路线，然后他们会进攻
They'll try to persuade us to change course presently and then they'll attack.

548
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:45,562
你打算怎么阻止他们？
How do you plan to stop them?

549
00:37:45,849 --> 00:37:47,032
切断他们的生命支持系统？
By cutting off their life support?

550
00:37:47,366 --> 00:37:48,274
我还有一个武器
I have another weapon.

551
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:49,850
你来控制，拉德兄弟
Take control, Brother Rad.

552
00:37:55,433 --> 00:37:56,479
你在干什么？
What are you doing?

553
00:37:56,831 --> 00:37:58,569

当我们在轨道上时告诉我
Let me know when we're in orbit.

569
00:39:20,649 --> 00:39:22,860
准时接近，就像他们绘制的那样，塞夫林兄弟
Approaching right on the dot, just as they plotted it, Brother Sevrin.

570
00:39:23,192 --> 00:39:24,362
那会对他们有什么影响？
What will that do to them?

571
00:39:24,774 --> 00:39:25,408
它是什么？
What is it?

572
00:39:26,370 --> 00:39:28,279
我用声音对付他们
Well, I'm using sound against them.

573
00:39:29,023 --> 00:39:30,014
频率超出超声波
Beyond the ultrasonic.

574
00:39:30,044 --> 00:39:31,742
它会击晕他们，让我们有时间离开
It will stun them and allow us time to leave.

575
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:33,723
我们将乘坐他们的一架穿梭机
We'll go in one of their shuttlecraft.

576
00:39:34,010 --> 00:39:35,855
那么高的音不会击晕
Sound pitch that high doesn't stun.

577
00:39:36,549 --> 00:39:37,461
它能杀人
It destroys.

578
00:39:38,408 --> 00:39:40,386
我记得当我们在文本中读到它时…
I remember when we read in the text that it...

579
00:39:40,461 --> 00:39:42,370
我比那些文本更正确，伊琳娜
I've gone beyond those texts, Irina.

580
00:39:43,330 --> 00:39:47,490
你的担心是正确的，但也请放心
It's correct for you to be concerned, but be assured also.

581
00:39:50,099 --> 00:39:52,334
我们在伊甸上方的轨道上，塞夫林兄弟
We are in orbit over Eden, Brother Sevrin.

582
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:55,896
它确实能杀人
It does destroy.

583
00:39:58,354 --> 00:40:00,836
我们不能让他们来追我们
We cannot allow them to come after us.

584
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:04,320
它不会触及我们这里，我可以控制这一切
It will not reach us in here. I can control it all.

585
00:40:05,448 --> 00:40:08,983
我已经进行了调整，这样就会在片刻后暂停其效果
I have adjusted it so that it will suspend its effects after a few moments

586
00:40:09,052 --> 00:40:10,248
让我们有时间逃离
and allow us time to escape.

587
00:40:11,041 --> 00:40:13,448
然后在我们离开后，它会自动重新激活
Then after we've gone, it will automatically reactivate.

588
