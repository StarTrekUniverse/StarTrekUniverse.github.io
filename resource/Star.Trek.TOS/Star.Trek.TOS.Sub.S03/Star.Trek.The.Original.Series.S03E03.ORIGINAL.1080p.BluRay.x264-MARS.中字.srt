1
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:37,642
- 看看那些松树  - 还有那个湖
- Look at those pine trees. - And that lake.

2
00:00:39,852 --> 00:00:45,942
- 我发誓我闻到了金银花的味道  - 混合着橙花
- I swear I smell honeysuckle. - With orange blossom thrown in.

3
00:00:46,109 --> 00:00:52,991
这太不可思议了，生长物和半个银河系之外的地球一模一样
It's unbelievable. Growth exactly like that of Earth half a galaxy away.

4
00:00:53,157 --> 00:00:56,828
- 这样的概率有多小？- 天文数字
- What are the odds of that? - Astronomical.

5
00:00:56,995 --> 00:00:59,789
这个星球的大小和年龄
The size and age of this planet

6
00:00:59,956 --> 00:01:04,877
这使得它极不可能像地球一样进化
makes it highly improbable that it would evolve similarly to Earth.

7
00:01:07,839 --> 00:01:10,675
那是什么东西？
What in blazes is that?

8
00:01:12,302 --> 00:01:15,305
- 分析？- 某种外星金属
- Analysis? - An alien metal of some kind.

9
00:01:15,471 --> 00:01:18,683
一种耐探针的合金
An alloy resistant to probe.

10
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:22,604
读数甚至无法准确测量其年龄
Readings can't even measure its age accurately.

11
00:01:27,317 --> 00:01:31,529
这些符号显然是某种形式的书写
These symbols are evidently some form of writing.

12
00:01:31,821 --> 00:01:35,366
- 知道它是什么吗？- 不知道，舰长
- Any theories about what it is? - Negative, Captain.

13
00:01:35,533 --> 00:01:40,330
如此复杂的结构需要复杂的建筑设备
Such complex structures require sophisticated building apparatus,

14
00:01:40,496 --> 00:01:45,043
通常存在于超越或等同我们的文化中
the kind usually found in cultures surpassing or equaling ours.

15
00:01:45,209 --> 00:01:49,547
整个地方在生物和文化上都是一个谜
The whole place is an enigma, biologically and culturally.

16
00:01:49,714 --> 00:01:53,801
最接近的生物聚集地在哪儿？
What's the nearest concentration of life-forms?

17
00:01:57,013 --> 00:02:00,350
方位 117，标记 4
Bearing 117, mark 4.

18
00:02:01,476 --> 00:02:03,728
我们有多少时间？
How much time do we have?

19
00:02:03,895 --> 00:02:07,523
如果我们要让小行星转向这颗行星,
If we are to divert the asteroid on its way to this planet,

20
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:09,984
我们必须在30分钟内离开
we must leave within 30 minutes.

21
00:02:10,151 --> 00:02:16,157
我们拖延的每一秒都会使问题复杂化，也许就是过时的解决方案了
Every second we delay compounds the problem, perhaps past solution.

22
00:02:16,324 --> 00:02:18,826
你说的是30分钟
You did say 30 minutes.

23
00:02:19,869 --> 00:02:22,497
是的，长官
Yes, sir.

24
00:02:22,664 --> 00:02:27,585
那么让我们来看看什么样的生命形式受到这种环境的保佑
Then let's find out what life-forms are blessed by this environment.

25
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:45,103
我发誓他们是美洲原住民
I'd swear they're American Indians.

26
00:02:45,269 --> 00:02:50,274
他们是，我相信是纳瓦霍人，莫希干人和特拉华人的混合
They are. A mixture of Navajo, Mohican and Delaware, I believe.

27
00:02:50,441 --> 00:02:53,903
所有这些都在更先进和平的部落中
All among the more advanced and peaceful tribes.

28
00:02:54,195 --> 00:02:58,032
这就像发现亚特兰蒂斯一样，或香格里拉
It's like discovering Atlantis. Or Shangri-La.

29
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:05,748
在这个星球上有没有可能还有一个更先进的文明？
Is it possible there's a more evolved civilization somewhere on this planet?

30
00:03:05,915 --> 00:03:10,545
一个能够建造方尖碑或开发偏转系统的人？
One capable of building that obelisk or developing a deflector system?

31
00:03:10,712 --> 00:03:15,633
极不可能，传感器显示这里只有一种生命形式
Highly improbable. Sensors indicate only one type of life-form here.

32
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,469
我们不应该联系他们吗？告诉他们？
Shouldn't we contact them? Tell them?

33
00:03:18,636 --> 00:03:22,724
告诉他们什么？一颗小行星来粉碎他们的世界？
Tell them what? That an asteroid's coming to smash their world?

34
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:26,102
太原始，无法理解太空飞行的概念
Too primitive to grasp the concept of space flight.

35
00:03:26,269 --> 00:03:30,273
我们在这里的出现只会让他们感到困惑和恐惧
Our appearance here would only confuse and frighten them.

36
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:34,152
我们有工作要做，让我们回到企业号
We've got a job to do. Let's get back to the Enterprise.

37
00:03:45,288 --> 00:03:48,416
- 怎么了，吉姆？- 没什么
- What's the matter, Jim? - Nothing.

38
00:03:48,583 --> 00:03:51,627
这里太宁静，太简单了
It's just so peaceful. Uncomplicated.

39
00:03:51,794 --> 00:03:56,340
没有问题或指挥决定
No problems or command decisions.

40
00:03:56,507 --> 00:03:59,343
只有...生活
Just... living.

41
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:04,140
典型的人类对田园诗般的自然环境的反应
Typical human reaction to an idyllic natural setting.

42
00:04:04,307 --> 00:04:08,352
在20世纪，我们称之为塔希提岛综合症
In the 20th Century, we referred to it as the Tahiti Syndrome.

43
00:04:08,561 --> 00:04:12,857
这在压力过大的领导者类型中很常见，比如星际飞船舰长
It's common to over-pressured leader types, like starship captains.

44
00:04:13,024 --> 00:04:18,196
塔希提岛综合症，让我们去照顾那颗小行星吧
The Tahiti Syndrome. Let's go take care of that asteroid.

45
00:04:18,362 --> 00:04:22,158
但首先，我想再看一眼那座方尖碑
But first I want another look at that obelisk.

46
00:04:28,164 --> 00:04:29,665
- 医生？- 什么事？
- Doctor? - Yes?

47
00:04:29,832 --> 00:04:34,796
我建议将研究推迟到我们转移小行星之后
I suggest research be delayed until after we have diverted the asteroid.

48
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:46,474
- 柯克呼叫企业号  - 斯科提[通过无线电]：<i>是的，长官</i>

<i>Numerous search parties and repeated sensor probes</i>

<i>都没找到柯克舰长</i>
<i>have failed to locate Captain Kirk.</i>

- 史波克呼叫企业号  - 斯科提[通过无线电]：<i>请回答</i>
- Spock to Enterprise. - SCOTTY [OVER RADIO]: <i>Come in.</i>

59
00:06:34,832 --> 00:06:40,671
- 把我们传送上去，我们要走了  - 离开？你在开玩笑吧
- Beam us up. We're leaving. - Leaving? You can't be serious.

60
00:06:40,838 --> 00:06:45,176
那颗小行星几乎和月球一样大
That asteroid is almost as large as your Earth's moon.

61
00:06:45,343 --> 00:06:50,514
足够远，它改道所需的角度是微小的
Far enough away, the angle necessary to divert it is minute.

62
00:06:50,723 --> 00:06:56,145
但随着小行星的接近，角度变得如此之大，甚至......
But as the asteroid approaches, the angle becomes so great that even...

63
00:06:56,312 --> 00:06:59,273
那颗小行星在两个月内不会到达这里！
That asteroid won't get here for two months!

64
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:04,111
如果我们及时到达偏转点，它可能根本就到不了这里
If we arrive at the deflection point in time, it may not get here at all.

65
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:09,367
- 吉姆怎么办？- 我们将小行星改道，然后搜索
- What about Jim? - We'll divert the asteroid, then search.

66
00:07:09,617 --> 00:07:12,495
那可能是几个小时后，他可能快死了
That may be hours from now. He may be dying.

67
00:07:16,374 --> 00:07:18,542
医生
Doctor.

68
00:07:18,751 --> 00:07:23,631
假设这就是我们所处的星球，这是接近的小行星
Assume this is the planet we're on. This is the approaching asteroid.

69
00:07:23,798 --> 00:07:30,179
如果我们没有及时到达那里，就不可能使它转向了
It we don't get there in time, it will become impossible to divert this.

70
00:07:30,346 --> 00:07:36,018
那种情况下，这个星球上的每个人都会死，包括舰长
In that case, everyone on this planet will die, including the captain.

71
00:07:36,185 --> 00:07:38,229
再等几分钟有什么关系吗？
Can a few more minutes matter?

72
00:07:38,396 --> 00:07:41,315
在我解释的时间里
In the time it has taken me to explain,

73
00:07:41,482 --> 00:07:44,860
小行星已经从这里移动到这里
the asteroid has moved from here to here.

74
00:07:45,152 --> 00:07:49,782
我们拖延的时间越长，能让它改道的可能性就越小
The longer we delay, the less the likelihood of being able to divert it.

75
00:07:59,291 --> 00:08:01,585
传送我们上去，斯科特先生
Beam us up, Mr. Scott.

We are your people.

00:10:00,496 --> 00:10:03,958
我们一直在等你来找我们
We've been waiting for you to come to us.

<i>我们已经在前往小行星的途中停留了几个小时</i>
<i>We've been en route to the asteroid for hours.</i>

90
00:10:18,889 --> 00:10:24,144
<i>我们的耽搁使得我们必须以最大曲速前进</i>
<i>Our delay has made it imperative that we proceed at maximum warp </i>

91
00:10:24,311 --> 00:10:28,482
<i>时间会超过建议的安全限度</i>
<i>for a period which exceeds the recommended safety margin.</i>

92
00:10:28,649 --> 00:10:34,238
不能以曲速9飞行太长时间，引擎压力太大了
I can't give you warp 9 much longer. The engines are stressed.

93
00:10:34,405 --> 00:10:39,243
我们不能降低速度，我不会错过这个偏转点
We cannot reduce speed. I will not miss that deflection point.

94
00:10:39,451 --> 00:10:42,997
好的，但我们正在进入更危险范围
OK. But we're moving further into the danger range.

95
00:10:43,163 --> 00:10:46,917
反对已记录，斯科特先生，继续
Objection noted, Mr. Scott. Carry on.

96
00:11:01,348 --> 00:11:07,438
米拉曼尼说你从神殿里向她和她的侍女现身
Miramanee said you appeared to her and her handmaiden from the temple,

97
00:11:07,605 --> 00:11:09,773
正如我们的传说所预言的那样
just as our legend foretells.

98
00:11:09,982 --> 00:11:14,904
我们不怀疑她的话，但现在是动荡的时期
We do not doubt her words, but these are troubled times

99
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:17,239
我们必须确定
and we must be sure.

100
00:11:17,406 --> 00:11:23,746
我会尽量回答，但正如我所说，很多事情对我来说都是陌生的
I'll answer anything I can, but as I said, many things are strange to me.

他什么都不知道，他怎么能拯救我们呢？
He knows nothing. How can he save us?

102
00:11:26,874 --> 00:11:30,461
打断部落长老是违反习俗的
It is against custom to interrupt a tribal elder,

103
00:11:30,628 --> 00:11:33,464
甚至对于医师来说也是如此
even for the medicine chief.

104
00:11:33,631 --> 00:11:36,383
当天空变暗时，言语救不了我们
Words will not save us when the skies darken.

105
00:11:36,634 --> 00:11:40,554
我们必须确定，我说，他必须证明自己是神
We must be certain. I say he must prove he is a god.

106
00:11:42,139 --> 00:11:46,101
自收获以来，我们的天空已经变暗了三次
Our skies have darkened three times since the harvest,

107
00:11:46,268 --> 00:11:48,812
上一次最糟糕的
the last time worst of all.

108
00:11:49,146 --> 00:11:51,398
我们的传说预言了这种危险
Our legend predicts such danger

109
00:11:51,565 --> 00:11:55,653
并承诺把我们安置在这里的智者们
and promises that the Wise Ones who planted us here

110
00:11:55,819 --> 00:12:00,950
会派遣一位神来拯救我们，一位能够唤醒神殿精神的人
will send a god to save us, one who can rouse the temple spirit,

111
00:12:01,116 --> 00:12:03,327
让天空变得安静
and make the sky grow quiet.

112

你能做到吗？
Can you do this?

113
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:16,632
我来自神殿，正如米拉曼尼所说
I came from the temple, as Miramanee said.

114
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:21,845
这对我来说是一个开始
And it was a beginning for me.

115
00:12:22,012 --> 00:12:23,681
这里
Here.

116
00:12:24,682 --> 00:12:28,978
但我也是从天上来的
But I came from the sky, too.

117
00:12:29,144 --> 00:12:33,565

Only I... can't remember.

The boy was attending the fishnets and he sank to the bottom of the river.

121

鲁莫很快把他提起来，但他没有动
Lumo brought him up quickly, but he doesn't move.

122
00:12:58,090 --> 00:13:01,468

There is no sound in the body.

123
00:13:01,635 --> 00:13:04,346
眼睛里没有光
There is no light in the eyes.

124
00:13:04,513 --> 00:13:07,891
- 他不会再动了  - 等一下
- He will move no more. - Wait a moment.

125
00:13:45,679 --> 00:13:48,265
等
Wait.

- He'll be all right now. - My people are grateful.

128
00:14:11,538 --> 00:14:15,167
这是一个简单的技术，可以追溯到很久以前...
It's a simple technique. Goes way back...

129
00:14:18,796 --> 00:14:21,048
很久以前...
Way back...

00:14:21,215 --> 00:14:24,551
只有神才能给死人注入生命
Only a god can breathe life into the dead.

<i>那就手动控制</i>

<i>- 我们会烧坏引擎！</i>  - 我要全功率运行，斯科特先生
- <i>We'll burn out the engines!</i> - I want full power, Mr. Scott.

00:15:56,059 --> 00:15:57,853
全功率
Full power.

140
00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:01,565
放大系数12，苏鲁先生
Magnification factor 12, Mr. Sulu.

141
00:16:09,489 --> 00:16:12,367
契科夫：离偏转点不足4
CHEKOV: Deflection point minus 4.

142
00:16:12,534 --> 00:16:15,078
全部引擎停止，保持原位
All engines stop. Hold position.

143
00:16:20,918 --> 00:16:23,420
斯科提：<i>所有的引擎都停了，长官</i>
SCOTTY: <i>All engines stop, sir.</i>

144
00:16:23,587 --> 00:16:27,549
- 准备启动偏转器  - 是的，长官
- Prepare to activate deflectors. - Aye, sir.

145
00:16:34,431 --> 00:16:36,600
动力下降，长官
Power dropping, sir.

146
00:16:36,934 --> 00:16:40,437
轮机手，保持全功率，全功率
Engineering, maintain full power. Full power.

147
00:16:40,604 --> 00:16:43,440
<i>我们必须更换二锂晶体</i>
<i>We must replace the dilithium crystal.</i>

148
00:16:43,607 --> 00:16:47,611
- 现在不行  - 0，偏转点...现在，长官
- Not now. - Zero. Deflection point... now, sir.

149
00:16:47,778 --> 00:16:49,947
启动偏转器
Activate deflectors.

150
00:16:54,701 --> 00:16:56,536
动力下降，长官
Power dropping, sir.

151
00:17:03,794 --> 00:17:06,129
偏转角度，苏鲁先生
Degree of deflection, Mr. Sulu.

152
00:17:06,338 --> 00:17:10,926
还不够，长官，只有0.0013度
Not enough, sir. It's only 0.0013 degrees.

153
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:19,810
为引擎提供再循环动力，最大速度，航向37，标记010
Recircuit power to engines. Maximum speed, heading 37, mark 010.

154
00:17:19,977 --> 00:17:25,274
- 这将使我们进入小行星的路径  - 我们将在那颗小行星前面撤退
- That will put us in the asteroid's path. - We'll retreat in front of that asteroid

155
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:28,318
直到我们能把所有动力部署在相位炮上
until we can employ all power on phasers.

156
00:17:28,485 --> 00:17:31,113
- 为了什么？- 摧毁它
- What for? - To destroy it.

157
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:34,658
在一个单点上的窄光束将分裂该质量
A narrow beam on a single spot will split that mass.

158
00:17:34,866 --> 00:17:38,078
也可能使船瘫痪，然后我们被压碎
It might also cripple the ship, and we'd be crushed.

159
00:17:38,245 --> 00:17:41,748
我们将利用脉冲动力脱离它的轨道
We'll get out of its path by use of impulse power.

160
00:17:41,915 --> 00:17:44,626
吉姆将无法从它的轨道脱身
Jim won't be able to get out of its path.

161
00:17:44,835 --> 00:17:48,880
这是我们必须承担的另一个风险
That is another risk we must take.

162
00:18:02,936 --> 00:18:05,188
米拉曼尼
Miramanee.

163
00:18:09,026 --> 00:18:14,156
- 你在做什么？- 我必须满足神的需要
- What are you doing? - I must see to the needs of the god.

164
00:18:15,115 --> 00:18:17,701
你应该在做我们的仪式斗篷
You should be working on our ritual cloak.

165
00:18:17,909 --> 00:18:20,829
现在我们之间不再有仪式了
There will be no ritual between us now.

166
00:18:20,996 --> 00:18:23,540
什么？我们不能违背传统
What? We cannot go against tradition.

167
00:18:24,958 --> 00:18:29,629
正是因为传统，我不能嫁给你
It is because of tradition that I cannot marry you.

168
00:18:29,796 --> 00:18:32,215
但你已经答应我了
But you are promised to me.

169
00:18:33,633 --> 00:18:35,677
那是在他来之前
That was before he came.

170
00:18:35,844 --> 00:18:40,640
部落女祭司和首席医师总是结为夫妻
Tribal priestess and medicine chief are always joined.

171
00:18:40,807 --> 00:18:43,226
他现在是首席医师了
He is medicine chief now.

172
00:18:46,063 --> 00:18:51,234
萨利希，选别人吧，任何少女都会很荣幸与你结为夫妻
Salish, choose another. Any maiden would be honored to join with you.

173
00:18:51,443 --> 00:18:54,363
我不要其他人
I wish no other.

174
00:19:02,037 --> 00:19:04,581
你别无选择
You have no choice.

175
00:19:08,335 --> 00:19:11,880
米拉曼尼，如果你可以选择...
Miramanee, if you could choose...

176
00:19:15,258 --> 00:19:18,095
你会选择我吗？
would you choose me?

177
00:20:01,513 --> 00:20:04,433
也许你现在想洗澡
Perhaps you would like to bathe now.

178
00:20:06,309 --> 00:20:08,395
米拉曼尼...
Miramanee...

179
00:20:09,479 --> 00:20:12,899
跟我说说智者吧
tell me about the Wise Ones.

180
00:20:13,066 --> 00:20:15,652
要我说？神知道一切
Tell? But a god knows everything.

181
00:20:15,819 --> 00:20:18,822
我不知道，告诉我
Not this one. Tell me.

182
00:20:19,823 --> 00:20:23,326
智者从很远的地方把我们带到这里
The Wise Ones brought us here from far away.

183
00:20:23,493 --> 00:20:28,165
他们选择了一位首席医师来保守神殿的秘密
Those chose a medicine chief to keep the secret of the temple

184
00:20:28,331 --> 00:20:31,460
并在天空变暗时使用它
and to use it when the sky darkens.

185
00:20:33,295 --> 00:20:35,839
神殿的秘密
Secrets of the temple.

186
00:20:38,008 --> 00:20:40,927
没有系带，怎么解开？
There are no lacings. How is this removed?

187
00:20:41,094 --> 00:20:47,017
秘密是从父亲传给儿子的？
The secrets were passed on from father to son?

188
00:20:47,184 --> 00:20:49,853
是的，这如何打开的？
Yes. How does this open?

189
00:20:50,061 --> 00:20:54,357
为什么萨利希不使用它？为什么人们处于危险之中？
Why doesn't Salish use it? Why are the people in danger?

190
00:20:54,566 --> 00:20:57,611
他的父亲不想太早分享他的权力
His father did not wish to share his power too soon.

191
00:20:57,777 --> 00:21:00,780
他在告诉萨利希这个秘密之前就死了
He died before he told Salish the secret.

192
00:21:18,215 --> 00:21:22,719
我们的人民欢欣鼓舞，并希望授予你尊称
Our people rejoice, and wish to honor your name.

193
00:21:22,886 --> 00:21:27,307
但我不知道你希望别人怎么称呼你
But I did not know what you wished to be called.

194
00:21:27,474 --> 00:21:30,227
我该怎么和他们说？
What may I tell them?

195
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,236
柯...
Ki...

196
00:21:39,402 --> 00:21:41,988
柯尔...
Kir...

197
00:21:42,155 --> 00:21:44,699
柯洛克？
Kirok?

198
00:21:53,083 --> 00:21:57,879
- 我们让你不高兴吗？- 不，一切都很好
- Have we displeased you? - No. Everything is fine.

199
00:21:58,046 --> 00:22:01,341
那么一定是我们自己，我们生活的方式
Then it must be ourselves, the way we live.

200
00:22:01,508 --> 00:22:06,930
也许我们没有像智者所希望的那样迅速地进步
Perhaps we have not improved as quickly as the Wise Ones wish.

201
00:22:07,097 --> 00:22:09,766
你们的土地是富饶的，你们的人民是幸福的
Your land is rich, your people happy.

202
00:22:11,142 --> 00:22:14,437
谁会对此感到不满呢？
Who could be displeased with that?

203
00:22:14,646 --> 00:22:18,108
但还有一些东西，告诉我们
But there is something. Tell us.

204
00:22:18,275 --> 00:22:21,069
我们将改变它
We will change it.

205
00:22:21,236 --> 00:22:23,780
我不能告诉你任何事
I can't tell you anything.

206
00:22:25,782 --> 00:22:29,119
我只能告诉你
All I can tell you is that

207
00:22:29,286 --> 00:22:32,956
我在这里很快乐，很平静
I'm happy and peaceful here.

208
00:22:34,749 --> 00:22:39,588
我不确定，但我想我从来没有这种感觉
I'm not sure, but I think I've never felt that way before.

209
00:22:49,931 --> 00:22:52,892
为什么他们如此肯定我能帮助他们？
Why are they so sure I can help them?

210
00:22:53,059 --> 00:22:55,395
你来自石头金属
You came from the stone metal.

211
00:22:55,562 --> 00:22:59,441
- 你没有救那个孩子吗？- 救了，但是...
- And did you not bring life to the child? - Yes, but...

212
00:23:05,322 --> 00:23:07,616
我需要时间来回忆
I need time to remember.

213
00:23:11,995 --> 00:23:14,831
这里有很多时间
Here there is much time.

214
00:23:17,834 --> 00:23:20,003
给任何事
For everything.

215
00:23:32,974 --> 00:23:39,105
- 坐标，契科夫先生  - Tau 8.7，Beta 0.041
- Coordinates, Mr. Chekov. - Tau 8.7, Beta 0.041.

216
00:23:39,272 --> 00:23:43,276
这是我们的目标，小行星最薄弱的点
That is our target. The asteroid's weakest point.

217
00:23:44,444 --> 00:23:46,821
几乎正中心，长官
Almost dead center, sir.

218
00:23:47,113 --> 00:23:50,658
把所有相位炮锁定在那个标记，最大强度
Lock all phasers on that mark. Maximum intensity.

219
00:23:50,825 --> 00:23:54,871
- 我想劈开这个裂缝  - 就好像你在切割一颗钻石
- I want to split that fissure. - It's like you're cutting a diamond.

220
00:23:55,038 --> 00:23:58,124
- 非常贴切，医生  - 所有相位器锁定
- Very astute, Doctor. - All phasers locked.

221
00:23:58,291 --> 00:24:03,046
只要斯科特先生能够保持动力，我们就按顺序发射
We'll fire in sequence as long as Mr. Scott can maintain power.

222
00:24:03,213 --> 00:24:07,509
- 准备好了，长官  - 发射相位炮
- Standing by, sir. - Fire phasers.

223
00:24:08,927 --> 00:24:10,220
相位炮1发射
Phaser 1 firing.

224
00:24:10,553 --> 00:24:13,681
直到这些东西变成一滩铅水，他才会满意
He won't be satisfied till these are a puddle of lead.

225
00:24:13,848 --> 00:24:16,392
苏鲁：<i>相位炮2发射</i>
SULU: <i>Phaser 2 firing.</i>

226
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:18,394
主继电器再次熄灭
Main relay's out again.

227
00:24:21,397 --> 00:24:23,858
相位炮4发射
Phaser 4 firing.

228
00:24:25,485 --> 00:24:29,572
- 所有相位炮都已发射  - 用于同时射击的钻机
- All phasers fired. - Rig for simultaneous firing.

229
00:24:29,739 --> 00:24:32,534
准备同时发射
Commence simultaneous bombardment.

230
00:24:39,415 --> 00:24:43,711
我的孩子! 我可怜的孩子！
My bairns! My poor bairns!

231
00:24:45,755 --> 00:24:47,841
[脚步声]
[FOOTSTEPS]

232
00:24:58,935 --> 00:25:02,605
仪式斗篷完成了
The ritual cloak is finished.

233
00:25:02,772 --> 00:25:07,026
- 我想确定婚礼日期  - 婚礼日期？
- I would like to name the Joining day. - The Joining day?

234
00:25:07,318 --> 00:25:11,865
我是酋长的女儿，部落法律把我许配给了我们的领袖
I'm the daughter of the chief. Tribal law betroths me to our leader.

235
00:25:12,866 --> 00:25:15,702
如果有别人，我会退出
If there is another, I will step aside.

236
00:25:17,871 --> 00:25:23,084
不，在我心中没有其他人
No, there is no one else in my mind or my heart.

237
00:25:26,713 --> 00:25:29,799
神的愿望凌驾于部落律法之上
God's wish is above tribal law.

238
00:25:35,263 --> 00:25:38,099
确定婚礼日期吧
Name the Joining day.

239
00:25:42,437 --> 00:25:47,984
我们的幸福开始得越早，持续的时间就越长。
The sooner our happiness together begins, the longer it will last.

240
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:54,574
- 明天  - 明天
- Tomorrow. - Tomorrow.

241
00:25:59,787 --> 00:26:03,291
斯科提：<i>别再要求曲速9的速度了</i>
SCOTTY: <i>And don't ask for any more warp 9 speeds.</i>

242
00:26:03,458 --> 00:26:07,212
<i>我们的星际推进器烧毁了，我们只剩脉冲动力了</i>
<i>Our star drive is burnt out. All we have left is impulse power.</i>

243
00:26:07,378 --> 00:26:12,217
- 预计维修时间  - 像这样漂在太空中？永远
- Estimated repair time. - Hanging here in space? For ever.

244
00:26:12,383 --> 00:26:15,929
<i>唯一能修复这些宝贝的是维修基地</i>
<i>The only thing that will fix these darlings is a repair base.</i>

245
00:26:16,095 --> 00:26:19,807
我已经猜到了，谢谢，斯科特先生
I've already surmised that. Thank you, Mr. Scott.

246
00:26:22,018 --> 00:26:28,274
你以为在瓦肯式的精确权衡下值得冒这个险，但你输了
You took your calculated risk in your calculated Vulcan way and you lost.

247
00:26:28,441 --> 00:26:32,528
对我们，对那颗星球，对吉姆，你都输了
You lost for us, you lost for that planet, and you lost for Jim.

248
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:37,492
- 我承担责任  - 我职责是保护船员的健康
- I accept the responsibility. - My responsibility is the crew's health.

249
00:26:37,659 --> 00:26:41,371
我想让你休息一下
I want you to get some rest.

250
00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:47,377
契科夫先生，继续航向883，标记41
Mr. Chekov, resume heading 883, mark 41.

251
00:26:47,543 --> 00:26:50,630
回那个星球？这需要几个月的时间
Back to that planet? It'll take months.

252
00:26:50,797 --> 00:26:55,885
正好59.223天，医生
Exactly 59.223 days, Doctor.

253
00:26:56,052 --> 00:27:01,057
这颗小行星将一直落后我们四个小时
And that asteroid will be four hours behind us all the way.

254
00:27:01,224 --> 00:27:03,226
那有什么用呢？
Then what's the use?

255
00:27:03,434 --> 00:27:08,231
即使舰长还活着，我们也可能救不了他
We might not be able to save the captain even if he still is alive.

256
00:27:08,439 --> 00:27:12,235
我们可能救不了任何东西，包括这艘船
We might not be able to save anything, including this ship.

257
00:27:19,158 --> 00:27:21,911
你根本没有听我刚刚说的话
You haven't heard a word I've said.

258
00:27:22,078 --> 00:27:26,249
你一直盯着那座被炸毁的方尖碑
You've just been staring at that blasted obelisk.

259
00:27:26,457 --> 00:27:31,337
另一个精心计算的瓦肯式冒险，医生
Another calculated Vulcan risk, Doctor.

260
00:27:37,677 --> 00:27:40,596
这场婚礼代表着黑暗的终结
This Joining means the end of darkness.

261
00:27:40,763 --> 00:27:43,474
这是我们所有人的欢乐时光
It's a time for joy for all my people.

262
00:27:50,773 --> 00:27:55,987
你等着我先走圣道到达大地小屋
You will wait until I walk the holy path to the earth lodge first,

263
00:27:56,279 --> 00:28:00,116
给我时间告诉女祭司你跟着
to give me time to tell the priestess that you follow,

264
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:03,036
然后婚礼举行
and that the Joining will take place.

265
00:28:12,545 --> 00:28:15,048
柯克：<i>我找到了天堂</i>
KIRK: <i>I have found paradise.</i>

266
00:28:15,214 --> 00:28:18,760
<i>当然，从来没有人获得过这样的幸福</i>
<i>Surely no man has ever attained such happiness.</i>

267
00:28:30,772 --> 00:28:36,069
- 别挡我的路，萨利希  - 柯洛克，我不同意这场婚礼
- Get out of my way, Salish. - Kirok, I cannot permit this Joining.

268
00:28:36,235 --> 00:28:39,655
- 我们不需要你的同意  - 那就打死我
- We don't need your permission. - Then strike me dead.

269
00:28:39,822 --> 00:28:42,617
我无意打死你
I have no intention of striking you dead.

270
00:28:47,455 --> 00:28:50,166
萨利什： 你流血了！
SALISH: You bleed!

271
00:28:50,333 --> 00:28:53,044
你流血了，柯洛克！
You bleed, Kirok!

272
00:28:53,211 --> 00:28:56,339
看哪，一个流血的神！
Behold a god who bleeds!

273
00:29:04,639 --> 00:29:07,683
看哪，有个流血的神
Behold a god who bleeds.

274
00:29:32,375 --> 00:29:35,211
杀了我，杀了我，柯洛克
Kill me. Kill me, Kirok.

275
00:29:35,378 --> 00:29:40,383
我绝不罢休，直到我向我的子民证明你不是神
For I will not rest until I prove to my people that you are no god.

276
00:30:25,761 --> 00:30:30,933
- 不到医务室报告？- 我必须破译方尖碑符号
- Not reporting to Sickbay? - I must decipher the obelisk symbols.

277
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:33,269
他们是先进的密码文字
They're advanced cipher writing.

278
00:30:33,603 --> 00:30:37,273
从我们回来开始，你就一直在努力做这件事
You've been trying to do that since we started back.

279
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:41,277
我知道，当我们到达那颗星球时
I'm aware of that. And when we arrive at the planet

280
00:30:41,444 --> 00:30:45,323
我们只有不到四个小时的时间来实施救援
we'll have barely four hours to effect rescue.

281
00:30:45,490 --> 00:30:50,495
- 这些符号是关键  - 你死也不会读懂它们
- Those symbols are the key. - You won't read them by dying.

282
00:30:50,661 --> 00:30:54,499
你已经几周没有吃东西或睡觉了，你会崩溃的
You've hardly eaten or slept for weeks. You'll collapse.

283
00:30:54,665 --> 00:30:57,293
我不饿，医生
I am not hungry, Doctor.

284
00:30:57,585 --> 00:31:02,340
在压力下，我们瓦肯人可以连续几周不睡觉
And under stress, we Vulcans can do without sleep for weeks.

285
00:31:02,507 --> 00:31:05,968
你的新陈代谢低到几乎测不到了
Your metabolism is so low it can hardly be measured

286
00:31:06,135 --> 00:31:08,638
还有你称之为血液的绿色水...
and that green water you call blood...

287
00:31:08,804 --> 00:31:13,809
我的身体状况并不重要，那座方尖碑才重要
My physical condition is not important. That obelisk is.

288
00:31:13,976 --> 00:31:18,147
我的诊断是过度工作和内疚导致的疲劳
My diagnosis is exhaustion, brought on from overwork and guilt.

289
00:31:18,481 --> 00:31:21,817
你在责怪自己弄坏了这艘船
You're blaming yourself for crippling this ship.

290
00:31:21,984 --> 00:31:27,156
你错了，你做出了命令决定，换成吉姆也会这么做
You're wrong. You made a command decision. Jim would have done it, too.

291
00:31:27,323 --> 00:31:32,328
我的处方是休息，要我让警卫来强制执行吗？
My prescription is rest. Do I have to call security to reinforce it?

292
00:32:13,953 --> 00:32:16,038
米拉曼尼？
Miramanee?

293
00:32:22,378 --> 00:32:24,463
过来这里！
Come here!

294
00:32:32,555 --> 00:32:34,473
米拉曼尼？
Miramanee?

295
00:32:46,485 --> 00:32:49,614
每次你抱着我，都像第一次一样快乐
Each time you hold me is as joyous as the first.

296
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:53,576
我很高兴，我真高兴
I'm happy. I'm so happy.

297
00:32:56,704 --> 00:33:01,917
如果不是那些梦，我的心会完全平静下来
If it weren't for the dreams, my mind would be completely at peace.

298
00:33:03,336 --> 00:33:06,255
我以为你不再做那些梦了
I thought you no longer had the dreams,

299
00:33:06,422 --> 00:33:10,468
不再看到那些在天空中穿梭的小屋了
that you no longer saw the lodge which moves through the sky.

300
00:33:11,719 --> 00:33:14,597
他们回来了
They've come back.

301
00:33:15,723 --> 00:33:19,352
他们...他们消失了一段时间，但他们回来了
They... were gone for a while, but they've come back.

302
00:33:19,518 --> 00:33:25,608
而我...还看到了一些面孔
And I... see faces, too.

303
00:33:25,775 --> 00:33:27,777
非常模糊
Very dim.

304
00:33:27,943 --> 00:33:32,948
我觉得...我-我应该认识...认识他们
I feel... I-I should know... know them.

305
00:33:35,117 --> 00:33:39,455
我觉得我应该和他们在一起
I feel my place is with them.

306
00:33:39,622 --> 00:33:43,042
不在这里
Not here.

307
00:33:43,334 --> 00:33:46,504
我不配拥有这种幸福
I don't deserve this happiness.

308
00:33:48,255 --> 00:33:51,008
我有一份礼物给你
I have a gift for you.

309
00:33:52,301 --> 00:33:54,887
礼物？
A gift?

310
00:33:57,973 --> 00:34:01,644
- 什么？  - 它可能会让你快乐
- What? - It may make you happy.

311
00:34:03,270 --> 00:34:04,814
等等
Wait.

312
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:11,821
柯克：<i>在过去的几周里，我对米拉曼尼的爱与日俱增</i>
KIRK: <i>These last few weeks, my love for Miramanee grows stronger each day.</i>

313
00:34:11,987 --> 00:34:15,157
<i>然而，梦境每晚都会回来</i>
<i>However, the dreams return every night.</i>

314
00:34:15,324 --> 00:34:21,330
<i>记忆的碎片...我几乎可以抓住他们</i>
<i>Fragments of memories... I can almost get hold of them,</i>

315
00:34:21,497 --> 00:34:23,708
<i>然后，</i>
<i>and then...</i>

316
00:34:31,006 --> 00:34:33,551
我怀了你的孩子
I bear your child.

317
00:34:41,726 --> 00:34:44,186
你！
You!

318
00:34:59,201 --> 00:35:05,124
一条灌溉渠，有了它我们能把湖水...
A canal. And with it we'll bring the water from the lake...

319
00:35:06,375 --> 00:35:08,878
直接引到小屋
right to the lodge.

320
00:35:09,044 --> 00:35:12,757
我们可以扩展系统
And we can expand the system

321
00:35:13,048 --> 00:35:16,927
灌溉田地，使粮食供应增加一倍
and irrigate the fields, and double the food supply.

322
00:35:18,387 --> 00:35:22,892
并且...有了灯的帮助
And... with the power of the lamp,

323
00:35:23,058 --> 00:35:25,478
把黑夜变成白昼
which turns night into day,

324
00:35:25,644 --> 00:35:29,607
我们可以煮两倍的食物，正如你教给我们的，保...
we can cook twice as much food and, as you taught us, pre...

325
00:35:29,774 --> 00:35:33,235
- 保存  - 保存
- Preserve. - Preserve.

326
00:35:33,402 --> 00:35:36,739
- 保存  - 为饥荒时期
- Preserve. - For times of famine.

327
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:40,284
这就是你制作这盏灯的原因
That is why you made the lamp.

328
00:35:40,451 --> 00:35:44,330
- 这样我就可以永远做饭了  - 哦，不
- So that I would be forever cooking. - Oh, no.

329
00:35:44,497 --> 00:35:48,918
让你永远做饭根本不是我做这盏灯的原因
That's not why I made the lamp at all, to keep you forever cooking.

330
00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:53,881
[雷球]
[THUNDERCRACK]

331
00:35:56,425 --> 00:36:00,387
只是风和雷声
It's only the wind and the thunder.

332
00:36:01,972 --> 00:36:06,268
我表现得像个傻孩子，我没什么好怕的，你在这里
I act like a stupid child. I have nothing to fear. You are here.

333
00:36:15,778 --> 00:36:18,948
- 是时候了  - 时候？
- It is time. - Time?

334
00:36:19,114 --> 00:36:22,993
去神殿救人
To go to the temple to save the people.

335
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:25,663
但风不能伤害他们
But the wind can't harm them.

336
00:36:25,955 --> 00:36:29,375
风只是开始，很快，天空就会变暗
The wind is only the beginning. Soon the sky will darken.

337
00:36:29,542 --> 00:36:35,339
湖水会变得狂野，大地会颤抖，只有你能拯救我们
The lake will go wild and the earth will tremble. Only you can save us.

338
00:36:35,506 --> 00:36:38,968
但是我对风或天空无能为力
But I can't do anything about the wind or the sky.

339
00:36:39,134 --> 00:36:41,846
如果我们现在不去，那就太晚了
If we do not go now, it will be too late.

340
00:36:42,012 --> 00:36:45,307
你必须让蓝色的火焰从神殿里出来
You must make the blue flame come out of the temple.

341
00:36:45,474 --> 00:36:48,978
我...不知道如何进入神殿
I... don't know how to get inside the temple.

342
00:36:49,144 --> 00:36:52,314
但你是神
But you are a god.

343
00:36:53,482 --> 00:36:56,652
萨利希：柯洛克！柯洛克！
SALISH: Kirok! Kirok!

344
00:36:57,987 --> 00:37:01,866
你为什么不在神殿里？很快，地面就会颤抖
Why are you not at the temple? Soon the ground will tremble.

345
00:37:02,032 --> 00:37:04,910
人们需要你的帮助
The people need your help.

346
00:37:05,077 --> 00:37:07,997
我们去洞穴，那里会很安全
We'll go to the caves. It will be safe there.

347
00:37:08,163 --> 00:37:13,043
洞穴？当然，一个传奇人物可以为他的人民做得更多
The caves? Surely a legend can do more than that for his people.

348
00:37:13,210 --> 00:37:16,338
当地面颤抖时，洞穴就不安全了
When the ground trembles, the caves are not safe.

349
00:37:16,505 --> 00:37:19,842
如果你不唤醒神殿精神，我们都会死！
If you do not rouse the temple spirit, we will all die!

350
00:37:20,009 --> 00:37:23,345
没有什么是你做不到的，我的丈夫
There is nothing you cannot do, my husband.

351
00:37:23,512 --> 00:37:27,558
神啊，你还在等什么呢？你的长袍？
What do you wait for, god? Your robes?

352
00:37:34,189 --> 00:37:36,692
照顾好米拉曼尼
Take care of Miramanee.

353
00:38:07,890 --> 00:38:10,559
我是柯洛克！
I am Kirok!

354
00:38:11,644 --> 00:38:17,107
我来了！我是柯洛克！
I have come! I am Kirok!

355
00:38:35,626 --> 00:38:39,588
- 我开了睡眠处方  - 你开了休息处方
- I prescribed sleep. - You prescribed rest.

356
00:38:39,755 --> 00:38:43,509
方尖碑上的符号是音符
The symbols on the obelisk are musical notes.

357
00:38:43,884 --> 00:38:46,595
你的意思是它只不过是一首歌？
You mean it's nothing but a song?

358
00:38:46,762 --> 00:38:50,516
在某种程度上，其他文化，其中包括某些瓦肯人的分支
In a way. Other cultures, among them certain Vulcan offshoots,

359
00:38:50,683 --> 00:38:52,601
使用音符作为单词
use musical notes as words.

360
00:38:52,768 --> 00:38:55,104
音调对应于字母表
The tones correspond to an alphabet.

361
00:38:55,270 --> 00:38:59,942
- 你弄明白了吗？  - 方尖碑是一个标记，正如我所想的那样
- Did you make any sense of it? - The obelisk is a marker as I thought.

362
00:39:00,109 --> 00:39:04,113
它被一个被称为"保护者"的超级种族所留下
It was left by a super race known as the Preservers.

363
00:39:04,279 --> 00:39:08,659
他们拯救了濒临灭绝的原始文化
They rescued primitive cultures which were in danger of extinction

364
00:39:08,826 --> 00:39:12,996
并把它们播种在可以生活和生长的地方
and seeded them where they could live and grow.

365
00:39:13,163 --> 00:39:16,875
我想知道为什么有这么多人形生物
I wondered why there were so many humanoids.

366
00:39:17,084 --> 00:39:20,796
显然，保护者占其中的一部分
Apparently the Preservers account for a number of them.

367
00:39:20,963 --> 00:39:23,465
这可能就是这个星球幸存下来的方式
That's probably how the planet has survived.

368
00:39:23,632 --> 00:39:29,763
- 他们在那里放了一个小行星偏转器  - 现在无法运行
- They put an asteroid deflector there. - Which is now failing to operate.

369
00:39:29,930 --> 00:39:33,642
我们必须找到偏转器并修复它
And we have to find the deflector and fix it.

370
00:39:33,809 --> 00:39:36,645
- 否则...   - 没错，医生
- Otherwise... - Precisely, Doctor.

371
00:39:39,648 --> 00:39:42,151
那个是假的！
There's the false one!

372
00:39:42,317 --> 00:39:45,821
去死！去死！
Die! Die!

373
00:39:45,988 --> 00:39:48,824
不！不！别伤害他！
No! No! Don't hurt him!

374
00:39:50,284 --> 00:39:52,494
- 米拉曼尼！- 不要伤害他！
- Miramanee! - Don't hurt him!

375
00:39:52,661 --> 00:39:55,998
- 回去！- 他是假的！
- Go back! - He's false!

376
00:39:56,165 --> 00:39:58,834
- 我属于他  - 那就走
- I belong to him. - Then go.

377
00:40:00,294 --> 00:40:02,671
和你的假神一起去死！
Die with your false god!

378
00:40:02,838 --> 00:40:05,424
你会被杀死的！
You'll be killed!

379
00:40:06,091 --> 00:40:07,801
杀了他！
Kill him!

380
00:40:11,221 --> 00:40:13,849
去死，冒牌货！
Die, impostor!

381
00:40:14,016 --> 00:40:16,643
- 你骗了我们！- 杀了他！
- You lied to us! - Kill him!

382
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:45,631
我需要查佩尔护士
I need Nurse Chapel.

383
00:40:46,673 --> 00:40:48,717
- 史波克呼叫企业号  - 斯科提[通过无线电]：<i>请回答</i>
- Spock to Enterprise. - SCOTTY [OVER RADIO]: <i>Come in.</i>

384
00:40:48,884 --> 00:40:52,888
把查佩尔护士和应急手术包传送下来
Beam down Nurse Chapel with an emergency surgical kit.

385
00:40:57,309 --> 00:41:01,355
我妻子，她没事吧？
My wife. Is she all right?

386
00:41:01,522 --> 00:41:04,566
妻子？幻觉？
Wife? Hallucinations?

387
00:41:06,944 --> 00:41:09,613
米拉曼尼
Miramanee.

388
00:41:36,056 --> 00:41:39,268
护士给了你一些东西来缓解疼痛
The nurse has given you something to ease the pain.

389
00:41:39,601 --> 00:41:42,271
你为什么被人用石头砸？
Why were you being stoned?

390
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:50,779
柯洛克无法回到...神殿
Kirok could not get back into the... temple.

391
00:41:51,113 --> 00:41:54,283
当然，因为他不是从那里来的
Naturally, since he did not come from there.

392
00:41:56,785 --> 00:41:59,872
我看到他来...来的
I saw him come... come...

393
00:42:11,091 --> 00:42:13,427
他认出我们了吗？
Does he recognize us?

394
00:42:13,594 --> 00:42:17,598
一切运作正常，除了他的记忆
Everything is functioning normally except his memory.

395
00:42:17,764 --> 00:42:19,808
帮助他需要时间
It would take time to help him.

396
00:42:19,975 --> 00:42:23,854
时间是唯一我们没有的东西
Time is the one thing we do not have in abundance.

397
00:42:24,021 --> 00:42:26,189
[通讯器哔哔声]
[COMMUNICATOR BLEEPS]

398
00:42:26,481 --> 00:42:28,942
- 我是史波克  - 苏鲁[通过无线电]：<i>路径报告</i>
- Spock here. - SULU [OVER RADIO]: <i>Tracking report.</i>

399
00:42:29,109 --> 00:42:32,321
<i>65分钟后到达安全边界</i>
<i>65 minutes to end of safety margin.</i>

400
00:42:32,487 --> 00:42:35,157
报告已知悉
Report noted.

401
00:42:36,325 --> 00:42:40,037
他是否强壮到可以进行瓦肯心灵融合？
Is he strong enough for Vulcan mind-fusion?

402
00:42:40,203 --> 00:42:42,664
我们别无选择
We have no choice.

403
00:42:53,008 --> 00:42:56,178
我是史波克
I am Spock.

404
00:42:57,179 --> 00:43:00,515
你是詹姆斯·柯克
You are James Kirk.

405
00:43:00,682 --> 00:43:04,645
我们的意识正在接近
Our minds are moving closer.

406
00:43:04,811 --> 00:43:10,025
再近点，再近点，再近点，詹姆斯·柯克
Closer, closer, closer, James Kirk.

407
00:43:10,484 --> 00:43:13,195
再近一点
Closer.

408
00:43:13,362 --> 00:43:14,613
不！
No!

409
00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:17,532
- 詹姆斯·柯克  - 米拉曼尼！
- James Kirk. - Miramanee!

410
00:43:17,699 --> 00:43:20,285
不！米拉曼尼！
No! Miramanee!

411
00:43:20,452 --> 00:43:24,206
我们的意识...是一体的
Our minds... are one.

412
00:43:26,959 --> 00:43:33,465
- 我...是...柯洛克  - 柯洛克！
- I... am... Kirok. - Kirok!

413
00:43:34,508 --> 00:43:39,012
两者：我...是...柯洛克！
BOTH: I... am... Kirok!

414
00:43:39,179 --> 00:43:42,724
我是柯...
I am Ki...

415
00:43:44,393 --> 00:43:48,355
我...我是柯洛克！
I... I'm Kirok!

416
00:43:50,065 --> 00:43:53,068
- 我是... - 史波克！
- I am... - Spock!

417
00:43:55,779 --> 00:44:00,367
- 这是什么？- 他的意识
- What is it? - His mind.

418
00:44:00,534 --> 00:44:05,080
他是...一个非常有活力的人
He's... an extremely dynamic individual.

419
00:44:14,589 --> 00:44:16,633
成功了
It worked.

420
00:44:24,391 --> 00:44:27,936
舰长，你在这个建筑物里面吗？
Captain, were you inside this structure?

421
00:44:28,103 --> 00:44:32,149
是的，里面装满了科学设备
Yes. What's inside is loaded with scientific equipment.

422
00:44:32,315 --> 00:44:37,320
方尖碑是一个偏转装置，我们必须立即进入
The obelisk is a deflector mechanism. We must get inside immediately.

423
00:44:39,114 --> 00:44:42,117
舰长，我们没有太多时间
Captain, we do not have much time.

424
00:44:46,913 --> 00:44:49,041
麦考伊
McCoy.

425
00:44:55,714 --> 00:45:02,012
- 我不知道怎么进去  - 如果我们不激活这个装置
- I don't know how to get inside. - If we do not activate the mechanism,

426
00:45:02,179 --> 00:45:05,265
整个星球将被摧毁
this entire planet will be destroyed.

427
00:45:06,308 --> 00:45:09,644
答案一定在这些符号中，我们必须破译它们
The key must be in the symbols. We must decipher them.

428
00:45:09,811 --> 00:45:12,981
在某种程度上，我有，它们是音符
I have, to some extent. They are musical notes.

429
00:45:13,315 --> 00:45:16,651
演奏乐器可以获得入场券吗
Entry can be gained by playing an instrument?

430
00:45:16,818 --> 00:45:22,491
这将是一种方法，另一种是一系列的音调特征
That would be one method. Another would be a series of tonal qualities.

431
00:45:22,657 --> 00:45:24,659
把你的通讯器给我
Give me your communicator.

432
00:45:25,827 --> 00:45:30,165
我一定是在联系飞船时不小心猜到了
I must have hit it accidentally when I contacted the ship.

433
00:45:30,332 --> 00:45:33,668
如果你能记得你的原话，舰长...
If you can remember your exact words, Captain...

434
00:45:37,714 --> 00:45:40,467
- 柯克呼叫<i>企业号</i>  - 斯科提[通过无线电]：<i>是的，舰长</i>
- Kirk to <i>Enterprise </i>. - SCOTTY [OVER RADIO]: <i>Aye, Captain.</i>

435
00:45:44,012 --> 00:45:48,016
如果偏转器在 20 分钟内未激活
If the deflector isn't activated within 20 minutes,

436
00:45:48,183 --> 00:45:51,520
让<i>企业号</i>离开危险区域
get the <i>Enterprise</i> out of the danger zone.

437
00:45:51,686 --> 00:45:56,024
登陆小队可以牺牲，<i>企业号</i>不能
The landing party is expendable. The <i>Enterprise</i> isn't.

438
00:45:56,191 --> 00:45:58,151
柯克完毕
Kirk out.

439
00:45:58,318 --> 00:46:00,529
米拉曼尼
Miramanee.

440
00:46:02,322 --> 00:46:04,866
老骨头，陪着她
Bones, stay with her.

441
00:46:05,033 --> 00:46:07,160
尽你所能
Do what you can.

442
00:46:17,504 --> 00:46:22,384
它类似于我见过的面板，但要复杂得多
It is similar to panels I've seen, but far more complicated.

443
00:46:22,551 --> 00:46:26,429
小心，我一定是不小心撞到了什么东西
Careful. I must have hit something accidentally.

444
00:46:27,681 --> 00:46:31,852
一道光束抓住了我，就在那时我停止了记忆
A beam caught me and that's when I stopped remembering.

445
00:46:32,018 --> 00:46:36,523
可能是记忆光束，您必须按顺序激活它
Probably a memory beam. You must have activated it out of sequence.

446
00:46:36,773 --> 00:46:42,529
- 更多符号，你能读懂它们吗？  - 我确实对音乐有很好的眼光
- More symbols. Can you read them? - I do have an excellent eye for music.

447
00:46:42,696 --> 00:46:46,449
它们表明，这一系列的继电器在...
They indicate that this series of relays, activated in...

448
00:46:46,658 --> 00:46:49,911
史波克，按右边的按钮
Spock, just press the right button.

449
00:47:21,234 --> 00:47:26,114
- 她怎么样？- 她内伤严重，吉姆
- How is she? - She had bad internal injuries, Jim.

450
00:47:26,823 --> 00:47:29,451
她会活下去吗？
Will she live?

451
00:47:29,618 --> 00:47:31,453
不
No.

452
00:47:58,104 --> 00:48:01,942
柯洛克，这是真的，你是安全的
Kirok. It is true. You are safe.

453
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:06,112
你们的人们也是如此
And so are your people.

454
00:48:08,615 --> 00:48:11,743
我知道你会救他们的，我的首席医师
I knew you would save them, my chief.

455
00:48:15,497 --> 00:48:19,125
当我好转时
When I am better,

456
00:48:19,292 --> 00:48:24,255
它会像以前一样，不是吗？
it will be as it was, will it not?

457
00:48:25,966 --> 00:48:28,551
如果这是你想要的
If that's what you want.

458
00:48:30,804 --> 00:48:35,266
我们将过上长寿和幸福的生活
We will live long and happy lives.

459
00:48:37,352 --> 00:48:43,191
我要给你生许多强壮的儿子[呻吟]
I will bear you many strong sons. [MOANS]

460
00:48:46,653 --> 00:48:50,532
我会永远爱你
I'll love you always.

461
00:48:53,410 --> 00:48:56,579
我会爱你的，米拉曼尼
And I'll love you, Miramanee.

462
00:48:57,497 --> 00:48:59,582
永远
Always.

463
00:49:11,553 --> 00:49:15,890
每个吻都像第一次
Each kiss is as the first.
