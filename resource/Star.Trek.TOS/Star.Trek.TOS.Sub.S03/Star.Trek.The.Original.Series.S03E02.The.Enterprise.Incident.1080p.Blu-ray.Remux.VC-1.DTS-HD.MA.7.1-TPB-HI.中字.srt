<i>我很担心柯克舰长。</i>
<i>I'm concerned about Captain Kirk.</i>

4
00:00:14,128 --> 00:00:17,965
<i>他表现出越来越紧张和情绪压力的迹象。</i>
<i>He shows indications of increasing tension and emotional stress.</i>

5
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:19,883
我完成了任务，舰长。
I have completed the assignment, captain.

6
00:00:20,008 --> 00:00:22,678
- 理论上的入侵-- - 是的，契科夫先生。我会读。
- A theoretical incursion into-- - Yes, Mr. Chekov. I can read.

7
00:00:22,803 --> 00:00:26,348
和往常一样，你的理论评估与我的不一致。
And as usual, your theoretical evaluations do not tally with mine.

8
00:00:26,473 --> 00:00:30,185
回到你的岗位，你的工作令人满意时我会通知你。
Return to your duty and I'll let you know when your work is satisfactory.

9
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:32,980
史波克，请对该区域进行全传感器扫描。
Spock, full-sensor scan of the region, please.

10
00:00:33,063 --> 00:00:35,816
- 我确实对它做了一份完整的报告-- - 是的，那是过去。
- I did give a full report on it-- - Yes, that was the past.

11
00:00:35,858 --> 00:00:37,317
我关心的是现在。
I'm concerned with the present.

12
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:39,278
向我展示当前的信息
Or is it becoming too much for this crew

13
00:00:39,319 --> 00:00:41,029
对船员来说这很过分吗？
to present me with current information?

14
00:00:41,155 --> 00:00:43,115
不，先生。合规性没有问题。
No, sir. Compliance presents no problem.

15
00:00:43,173 --> 00:00:45,008
那么，史波克先生，请遵守。
Then, Mr. Spock, comply.

16
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,579
传感器扫描到二分之一秒差距。
Sensor scan to one-half parsec.

17
00:00:48,912 --> 00:00:50,998
- 没问题，舰长。 - 很好。
- Negative, captain. - Very well.

18
00:00:51,081 --> 00:00:53,625
麦考伊：<i>我找不到舰长行为的理由</i>
McCOY: <i>I can find no reason for the captain's behavior</i>

19
00:00:53,709 --> 00:00:55,961
<i>除了，可能，我们已经巡逻太久了</i>
<i>except, possibly, that we've been on patrol too long</i>

20
00:00:56,003 --> 00:00:58,046
<i>没有换班和消遣。</i>
<i>without relief and diversion.</i>

00:00:58,172 --> 00:01:01,925
<i>他拒绝了我对他进行心理分析的所有尝试。</i>
<i>He has resisted all my attempts to run a psychological profile on him.</i>

22
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:04,178
保持航向和速度，长官。
Maintaining course and speed, sir.

23
00:01:04,261 --> 00:01:08,015
改变航线，转到185标记3。
Change course. Come about to 185 mark 3.

24
00:01:10,058 --> 00:01:12,853
但这将导致我们直接进入罗慕伦中立区。
But that will lead us directly into the Romulan Neutral Zone.

25
00:01:12,978 --> 00:01:14,480
苏鲁先生，这很有洞察力。
That's very perceptive, Mr. Sulu.

26
00:01:14,563 --> 00:01:16,607
我知道航线变化会把我们带到哪里。
I know where the course change takes us.

27
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:20,777
- 执行。 - 是，长官。
- Execute. - Aye, sir.

28
00:01:35,834 --> 00:01:39,171
将传感器扫描增加到一秒差距。
Increasing sensor scan to one parsec.

29
00:01:39,963 --> 00:01:43,550
所有的扫描仪报告没有异常，我们附近没有任何异常。
All scanners report clear and nothing in our immediate vicinity.

30
00:01:43,717 --> 00:01:45,594
越来越好了，史波克先生。
Better and better, Mr. Spock.

31
00:01:45,761 --> 00:01:47,846
舰长，正在离开中立区，
Captain, leaving neutral zone,

32
00:01:47,971 --> 00:01:49,556
现在进入罗慕伦空间。
now entering Romulan space.

33
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,558
很好，苏鲁先生。
Very well, Mister Sulu.

34

上尉。
Lieutenant.

35
00:01:54,645 --> 00:01:56,188
命令是什么时候下达的？
When did the order come through?

36
00:01:56,271 --> 00:01:58,190
- 命令？ - 来自星际舰队。
- Order? - From Starfleet.

37
00:01:58,315 --> 00:02:00,484
进入中立区的命令。
The order to enter the neutral zone.

38
00:02:00,609 --> 00:02:03,570
我不知道有什么命令，斯科特先生。
There's been no order I know of, Mr. Scott.

39
00:02:04,488 --> 00:02:07,115
但肯定的是，舰长没有权利这样做吧？
But surely the captain couldn't be doing this on his own authority?

40
00:02:07,157 --> 00:02:10,786
如果你们两个有任何抱怨，你可以把它们公开。
If you two have any complaints, you can bring them out into the open.

41
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,962
那是一艘克林贡飞船。
That's a Klingon ship.

42
00:02:23,215 --> 00:02:25,300
但它不可能，在这个领域不可能。
But it couldn't be, not in this area.

43
00:02:25,384 --> 00:02:29,263
情报报告罗慕伦人现在使用克林贡设计。
Intelligence reports Romulans now using Klingon design.

44
00:02:29,346 --> 00:02:32,808
拉红色警报，进入战斗岗位，相位炮待命。
Sound red alert, man battle stations. Stand by main phasers.

45
00:02:32,891 --> 00:02:35,435
战斗岗位，所有人，战斗岗位。
Battle stations, all hands, battle stations.

47

第二艘船出现了。
A second ship has appeared.

48
00:02:45,654 --> 00:02:50,117
更正。现在有三艘。
Correction. There are now three.

49
00:02:53,996 --> 00:02:55,414

55
00:04:18,237 --> 00:04:20,707
乌乎拉上尉，给星际舰队司令部发一条加密信息。
Lieutenant Uhura, code a message to Starfleet Command.

56
00:04:20,832 --> 00:04:23,710
将我们的情况告知他们，包括到现在为止的所有日志条目。
Advise them of our situation, include all log entries to this point.

57
00:04:23,794 --> 00:04:24,920
是的，长官。
Aye, aye, sir.

58
00:04:25,045 --> 00:04:27,881
史波克先生，你的传感器读数清晰。发生了什么？
Mr. Spock, your sensors read clear. What happened?

59
00:04:28,006 --> 00:04:30,759
- 我有一个理论，舰长-- - 乌乎拉：柯克舰长。
- I have a theory, captain-- - UHURA: Captain Kirk.

60
00:04:30,842 --> 00:04:33,679
我正在从罗慕伦船只接收 2 级信号。
I'm receiving Class 2 signal from the Romulan vessel.

61
00:04:33,804 --> 00:04:35,555
把它放在屏幕上，上尉，
Put it on the viewing screen, lieutenant,

62
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:38,058
并完成发给星际舰队司令部的消息。
and complete that message to Starfleet Command.

63
00:04:41,895 --> 00:04:45,065
<i>你已被确认为星舰</i>企业号。
<i>You have been identified as the starship</i> Enterprise.

<i>詹姆斯·T·柯克舰长，已知是指挥。</i>
<i>Captain James T. Kirk, last known to be in command.</i>

65
00:04:48,402 --> 00:04:51,196
你的信息是正确的。我是柯克舰长。
Your information is correct. This is Captain Kirk.

<i>我是罗慕伦舰队的副指挥官塔尔。</i>
<i>I am Sub-Commander Tal of the Romulan fleet.</i>

00:04:55,033 --> 00:04:57,035
<i>你的船被包围了，舰长。</i>

<i>请你立即投降，否则我们会摧毁你。</i>

他们想要什么东西，
They want something,

71
00:05:06,712 --> 00:05:08,505
否则他们早就把我们消灭了。
or they would have destroyed us by now.

72
00:05:08,588 --> 00:05:12,342
没错，舰长。那是标准的罗慕伦程序。
True, captain. That would be standard Romulan procedure.

73
00:05:12,592 --> 00:05:15,595
他们要的是我的飞船。而且非常想要。
It's my ship they want. And very badly.

74
00:05:15,679 --> 00:05:18,223
它将是一个很好的战利品。
It would be a great prize.

76

省省你的威胁吧。
Save your threats.

如果你登上这艘船，我就炸了它。你将一无所获。
If you board this ship, I'll blow it up. You'll gain nothing.

你要明白星际舰队司令部
You understand that Starfleet Command

89
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,478
已被告知情况。
has been advised of the situation.

00:06:04,686 --> 00:06:09,191
<i>一条子空间消息需要三周时间才能到达星际舰队。</i>
<i>A sub-space message will take three weeks to reach Starfleet.</i>

91
00:06:09,524 --> 00:06:12,903
<i>决定权在你，舰长。一小时。</i>
<i>The decision is yours, captain. One hour.</i>

柯克：这艘船的设计是一样的。
KIRK: The design of the ship is the same.

93
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,659
史波克先生，
Mr. Spock,

94
00:06:19,868 --> 00:06:21,995
你说你有一个理论，为什么你的传感器
you said you had a theory on why your sensors

95
00:06:22,078 --> 00:06:25,290
在新船到达我们面前时才检测到它们？
didn't pick up the new ships until they were upon us?

96
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:28,668
我相信罗慕伦人已经开发出一种隐形装置
I believe the Romulans have developed a cloaking device

97
00:06:28,752 --> 00:06:31,213
这使我们的跟踪传感器失效。
which renders our tracking sensors useless.

98
00:06:31,296 --> 00:06:33,757
如果是这样，罗慕伦人可以攻击联邦领域
If so, the Romulans could attack into Federation territory

99
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,176
在我们知道他们在那里之前，甚至在一艘船
before we knew they were there, before a vessel

100
00:06:36,301 --> 00:06:39,429
或者一个星球开始建立防线前。
or a planet could even begin to get their defenses up.

101
00:06:39,513 --> 00:06:41,473
他们抓住了我们，没错。
They caught us, right enough.

102
00:06:41,556 --> 00:06:45,310
这是一个绝妙的观察，斯科特先生。你还有其他有用的意见吗？
That's a brilliant observation, Mr. Scott. Do you have other helpful opinions?

103
00:06:45,435 --> 00:06:48,438
- 好吧，我们没有太多选择。 - 我们有三个。
- Well, we've not got many choices. - We have three.

104
00:06:48,897 --> 00:06:51,316
我们可以战斗然后被摧毁。
We can fight and be destroyed.

105
00:06:51,525 --> 00:06:54,611
或者我们可以自己摧毁<i>企业号</i>
Or we can destroy the <i>Enterprise</i> ourselves

106
00:06:54,736 --> 00:06:57,280
让她远离罗慕伦人，或者我们可以……
and keep her from the Romulans, or we can...

107
00:06:57,989 --> 00:06:59,407
...投降。
...surrender.

108
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:02,244
先生们，意见？
Opinions, gentlemen?

109
00:07:02,327 --> 00:07:04,329
如果<i>企业号</i>被罗慕伦人夺取
If the <i>Enterprise</i> is taken by the Romulans

110
00:07:04,412 --> 00:07:07,249
他们会知道关于星舰的一切。
they'll know everything there is to know about a starship.

111
00:07:10,669 --> 00:07:14,256
如果我们没有遵守你的命令穿过中立区
If we had not crossed the neutral zone on your order

112
00:07:14,464 --> 00:07:17,843
你现在就不需要我们的意见来支持决定
you would not now need our opinions to support a decision

113
00:07:17,926 --> 00:07:19,761
这本不该发生。
which should never have had to be made.

114
00:07:19,845 --> 00:07:22,681
吉姆，你命令我们？
Jim, you ordered us?

115
00:07:22,806 --> 00:07:24,307
你没有权限。
You had no authority.

116
00:07:24,432 --> 00:07:26,184
- 解散，医生。 - 吉姆。
- Dismissed, doctor. - Jim.

<i>但是，我们同意同时交换。</i>

the <i>Enterprise</i> must not be taken.

140
00:08:55,148 --> 00:08:58,944
如果罗慕伦人试图这样做，你要战斗，如果有必要的话
If the Romulans attempt it, you're to fight and if necessary

141
00:08:59,152 --> 00:09:01,071
自毁，明白吗？
destroy yourselves, is that clear?

142
00:09:01,196 --> 00:09:02,906
非常明白。
Perfectly clear.

143
00:09:09,412 --> 00:09:10,956
启动。
Energize.

144
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,898
柯克舰长。
Captain Kirk.

145
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:42,070
指挥官，我很荣幸。
Commander, I'm honored.

146
00:09:44,114 --> 00:09:45,949
我不这么认为。
I don't think so.

147
00:09:46,908 --> 00:09:49,661
但是我们有一件重要的事情要讨论。
But we have an important matter to discuss.

148
00:09:50,578 --> 00:09:55,250
你表面上的礼貌是讨论的序曲。
And your superficial courtesies are an overture to that discussion.

149
00:09:57,752 --> 00:09:59,504
你就是大副。
You are the first officer.

150
00:10:00,922 --> 00:10:02,424
史波克。
Spock.

151
00:10:04,092 --> 00:10:06,594
我先和舰长说话。
I speak first with the captain.

152
00:10:07,095 --> 00:10:08,763
你可以在外面等。
You may wait outside.

153
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:16,563
侵入罗慕伦空间的事情是银河系的重要事件之一，
The matter of trespass into Romulan space is one of galactic import,

154
00:10:16,855 --> 00:10:18,523
违反了条约。
a violation of treaties.

155
00:10:20,025 --> 00:10:22,027
现在，我简单地问你，
Now, I ask you simply,

156
00:10:22,652 --> 00:10:24,070
你在这里的使命是什么？
what is your mission here?

157
00:10:24,195 --> 00:10:27,490
仪器故障导致导航错误。
Instrument failure caused navigational error.

158
00:10:27,657 --> 00:10:29,784
在我们意识到之前，我们已经穿过了中立区。
We were across the neutral zone before we realized it.

159
00:10:29,909 --> 00:10:32,162
我们还没来得及回来就被你们的船包围了。
We were surrounded by your ships before we could get back.

160
00:10:32,245 --> 00:10:33,830
一艘星舰，
A starship,

161
00:10:34,289 --> 00:10:36,958
星际舰队最好的船只之一。
one of the Starfleet's finest vessels.

162
00:10:38,084 --> 00:10:41,963
你是说仪器故障正如你说的那样根本没有引起注意
You are saying instrument failure as radical as you suggest went unnoticed

163
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:44,007
直到你完全穿过中立区？
until you were well past the neutral zone?

164
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:46,718
可能会发生事故，断电、备用系统可能会出现故障。
Accidents can happen, cut-off, back-up systems can malfunction.

165
00:10:46,801 --> 00:10:48,511
我们几个月前就该进行全面检修了。
We were due for an overhaul months ago.

166
00:10:48,595 --> 00:10:50,055
我知道了。
I see.

167
00:10:50,138 --> 00:10:52,807
但是你能在有故障时导航？
But you were able to navigate with this malfunction?

168
00:10:52,932 --> 00:10:54,476
错误已得到纠正。
The error was corrected.

169
00:10:54,601 --> 00:10:57,062
但我怀疑这是否能排除你的间谍嫌疑。
But I doubt if it will clear you of espionage.

170
00:10:57,437 --> 00:10:59,481
我们不是在当间谍，指挥官。
We were not spying, commander.

171
00:10:59,564 --> 00:11:02,484
你的语言对我来说一直是最难的，舰长。
Your language has always been most difficult for me, captain.

172
00:11:02,567 --> 00:11:04,360
也许你有另一种说法？
Perhaps you have another word for it?

173
00:11:04,486 --> 00:11:07,030
如果你认为我们在那里，那你就大错特错了--
You are grossly mistaken if you think that we were there--

174
00:11:07,113 --> 00:11:09,240
- 你听我说-- - 如果是罗慕伦船只
- You listen to me-- - If a Romulan vessel

175
00:11:09,324 --> 00:11:13,787
没有很好的解释就冒险深入联邦领域，
ventured far into Federation territory without good explanation,

176
00:11:14,245 --> 00:11:16,539
星际基地指挥官会做什么？
what would a starbase commander do?

177
00:11:16,831 --> 00:11:18,291
你看，
You see,

178
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:20,502
它是双向的。
it works both ways.

179
00:11:20,835 --> 00:11:23,463
我几乎不相信你是受害方。
I hardly believe you are the injured party.

180
00:11:26,508 --> 00:11:27,634
史波克。
Spock.

181
00:11:27,926 --> 00:11:29,260
进来吧。
Come in.

182
00:11:39,062 --> 00:11:41,481
舰长发表了声明。
The captain has made his statement.

183
00:11:43,858 --> 00:11:45,151
我明白。
I understand.

184
00:11:45,276 --> 00:11:46,820
我必须承认
I must admit

185
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:49,114
见到你有点惊喜，史波克。
some surprise on seeing you, Spock.

186
00:11:50,406 --> 00:11:52,742
我们不知道<i>企业号</i>上有瓦肯人。
We were not aware of Vulcans aboard the <i>Enterprise</i>.

187
00:11:52,867 --> 00:11:54,744
星际舰队没有习惯
Starfleet is not in the habit

188
00:11:54,911 --> 00:11:57,288
告知罗慕伦人其舰只的人员情况。
of informing Romulans of its ships' personnel.

189
00:11:57,413 --> 00:11:58,748
的确。
Quite so.

190
00:11:58,915 --> 00:12:01,000
然而有一些船，
Yet there are certain ships,

191
00:12:01,835 --> 00:12:05,088
一些我们认识的官员。
certain officers that are known to us.

192
00:12:05,255 --> 00:12:07,674
你的情况看起来最有趣。
Your situation appears most interesting.

193
00:12:07,799 --> 00:12:10,593
是什么让你对史巴克特别感兴趣？
What earns Spock your special interest?

194
00:12:10,718 --> 00:12:12,428
他是个瓦肯人。
He is a Vulcan.

195
00:12:12,887 --> 00:12:15,181
我们的祖先有着相同的根源
Our forebears had the same roots

196
00:12:15,473 --> 00:12:18,476
和起源，你不会明白的，舰长。
and origins, something you wouldn't understand, captain.

197
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,146
我们能感应瓦肯人，
We can appreciate the Vulcans,

198
00:12:21,563 --> 00:12:23,273
我们远方的兄弟。
our distant brothers.

199
00:12:26,234 --> 00:12:30,572
我听说过瓦肯诚实
I have heard of Vulcan integrity

200
00:12:30,989 --> 00:12:32,824
和个人荣誉。
and personal honor.

201
00:12:33,658 --> 00:12:35,785
有个著名说法，
There is a well-known saying,

202
00:12:36,578 --> 00:12:38,413
抑或是谣传，
or is it a myth,

203
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:41,457
瓦肯人不会说谎。
that Vulcans are incapable of lying.

204
00:12:41,749 --> 00:12:43,418
这不是谣传。
It is no myth.

205
00:12:45,753 --> 00:12:48,089
那么现在就如实告诉我，
Then tell me truthfully now,

206
00:12:48,715 --> 00:12:53,303
以你作为瓦肯人的荣誉，你们的任务是什么？
by your honor as a Vulcan, what was your mission?

207
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:56,222
我保留发言权
I reserve the privilege of speaking

208
00:12:56,347 --> 00:12:59,976
只有当它不会侵犯我作为瓦肯人的荣誉时。
only when it will not violate my honor as a Vulcan.

209
00:13:01,895 --> 00:13:06,024
一个瓦肯人不值得诉诸诡计。
It is unworthy of a Vulcan to resort to subterfuge.

210
00:13:06,149 --> 00:13:08,276
你很聪明，指挥官。
You're being clever, commander.

211
00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:10,904
这是罗慕伦人所不配的。
That is unworthy of a Romulan.

212
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:14,741
对自己隐瞒真相并不是谎言。
It is not a lie to keep the truth to oneself.

213
00:13:17,493 --> 00:13:19,746
那么这里有一个真相
Then there is a truth here

214
00:13:20,038 --> 00:13:21,581
仍然没有说出来。
that remains unspoken.

215
00:13:21,706 --> 00:13:23,958
都告诉你了，没什么好说的。
You've been told everything, there's nothing else to say.

216
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:27,879
这是史波克先生不肯透露的真相。
There is Mr. Spock's unspoken truth.

217
00:13:28,338 --> 00:13:32,258
你知道我们开发的隐形装置。
You knew of the cloaking device that we have developed.

218
00:13:32,717 --> 00:13:35,011
你故意侵犯罗慕伦空间
You deliberately violated Romulan space

219
00:13:35,136 --> 00:13:38,514
根据联邦司令部的命令公然执行间谍任务。
with a blatant spy mission by order of the Federation Command.

220
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:41,976
- 我们都经历过。 - 我们甚至还没有开始。
- We've been all through that. - We have not even begun.

221
00:13:46,231 --> 00:13:49,275
我没有能用的手段
There is no force that I can use

222
00:13:49,943 --> 00:13:53,905
来让一个瓦肯人说话。
on a Vulcan that will make him speak.

223
00:13:54,364 --> 00:13:56,199
这是事实。
That is a fact.

224
00:13:57,158 --> 00:13:59,327
但是有罗慕伦人的方法
But there are Romulan methods

225
00:13:59,535 --> 00:14:02,372
对人类和人类弱点
completely effective against humans

226
00:14:03,122 --> 00:14:05,250
完全有效。
and human weaknesses.

227
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:08,086
你不会求助于他们，指挥官。
You would not resort to them, commander.

228
00:14:08,503 --> 00:14:11,547
他们将证明对舰长无效。
They would prove ineffective against the captain.

229
00:14:11,756 --> 00:14:13,758
然后他们会让他死，
Then they will leave him dead,

230
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:16,928
或者比死更糟糕的事情。
or what might be worse than dead.

231
00:14:17,136 --> 00:14:20,431
但我会知道你不肯透露的真相。
But I will know your unspoken truths.

232
00:14:20,598 --> 00:14:22,517
让她骂。没什么好说的。
Let her rant. There's nothing to say.

233
00:14:22,642 --> 00:14:25,186
我不能让船长被进一步摧毁。 
I cannot allow the captain to be further destroyed.

234
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:27,438
指挥的压力给他带来了沉重的负担。
The strain of command has worn heavily upon him.

235
00:14:27,522 --> 00:14:30,566
- 他这几周都不像他自己了。 - 骗人。
- He's not been himself for weeks. - That's a lie.

236
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:34,737
如你所见，柯克舰长是一个非常敏感和情绪化的人。
As you can see, Captain Kirk is a highly sensitive and emotional person.

237
00:14:34,904 --> 00:14:37,407
我相信他已经失去了理性决策的能力。
I believe he has lost the capacity for rational decision.

238
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:40,660
- 闭嘴，史波克。 - 我没有泄露任何秘密。
- Shut up, Spock. - I am betraying no secrets.

239
00:14:40,743 --> 00:14:42,996
指挥官怀疑是星际舰队命令
The commander's suspicion that Starfleet ordered

240
00:14:43,079 --> 00:14:45,832
<i>企业号</i>进入中立区的，这是不可接受的。
the <i>Enterprise</i> into the neutral zone is unacceptable.

241
00:14:45,957 --> 00:14:48,835
我们的快速捕获证明了它的鲁莽。
Our rapid capture demonstrates its foolhardiness.

242
00:14:48,918 --> 00:14:50,461
你这个肮脏的骗子。
You filthy liar.

243
00:14:50,586 --> 00:14:52,088
我说的是实话
I am speaking the truth

244
00:14:52,213 --> 00:14:54,882
为了<i>企业号</i>和联邦的利益。
for the benefit of the <i>Enterprise</i> and the Federation.

245
00:14:55,008 --> 00:14:57,719
我说现在并记录在案
I say now and for the record

246
00:14:57,844 --> 00:15:01,306
柯克舰长命令<i>企业号</i>穿越中立区
that Captain Kirk ordered the <i>Enterprise</i> across the neutral zone

247
00:15:01,389 --> 00:15:04,267
靠他自己的主动性和他对荣耀的渴望。
on his own initiative and his craving for glory.

248
00:15:04,392 --> 00:15:07,145
我会为此杀了你，你这个叛徒，我会杀了你。
I'll kill you for this, you traitor, I'll kill you.

249
00:15:09,522 --> 00:15:11,607
我会杀了你。
I'll kill you.

250
00:15:11,691 --> 00:15:13,609
他不理智。
He is not sane.

251
00:15:27,582 --> 00:15:31,294
注意，<i>企业号</i>。我在罗慕伦旗舰上和你们讲话。
Attention, <i>Enterprise</i>. I am speaking to you from the Romulan flagship.

252
00:15:31,419 --> 00:15:35,465
联邦星舰企业号<i>，由詹姆斯·T·柯克舰长指挥</i>
<i>The</i> USS Enterprise, <i>under command of Captain James T. Kirk</i>

253
00:15:35,548 --> 00:15:39,093
<i>正式被指控犯有间谍罪。</i>
<i>is formally charged with espionage.</i>

254
00:15:39,344 --> 00:15:41,554
<i>大副史波克的证词</i>
<i>The testimony of First Officer Spock</i>

255
00:15:41,637 --> 00:15:43,973
<i>非常有助于确认</i>
<i>was highly instrumental in confirming</i>

256
00:15:44,098 --> 00:15:48,019
<i>这次闯入罗慕伦领域并非偶然。</i>
<i>this intrusion into Romulan space was not an accident.</i>

257
00:15:48,227 --> 00:15:51,064
<i>大副史波克的证词很具体</i>
<i>First Officer Spock's testimony was specific</i>

258
00:15:51,147 --> 00:15:54,901
<i>你的船没有受星际舰队司令部或联邦委员会的命令</i>
<i>that your ship was not under orders from Starfleet Command</i>

259
00:15:54,984 --> 00:15:58,780
<i>执行这样的间谍任务。</i>
<i>or the Federation Council to perform such a spy mission.</i>

260
00:15:58,905 --> 00:16:02,533
全权负责的是柯克舰长。
It was Captain Kirk who was solely responsible.

261
00:16:02,742 --> 00:16:05,328
由于船员们不得不服从命令，
Since the crew had no choice but to obey orders,

262
00:16:05,411 --> 00:16:07,663
船员将不承担任何责任。
the crew will not be held responsible.

263
00:16:07,747 --> 00:16:10,541
因此，我命令工程师斯科特，
Therefore, I am ordering Engineer Scott,

264
00:16:10,625 --> 00:16:12,794
目前指挥<i>企业号</i>，
presently in command of the <i>Enterprise</i>,

265
00:16:12,919 --> 00:16:14,796
跟随罗慕伦旗舰
to follow the Romulan flagship

266
00:16:15,088 --> 00:16:16,714
<i>到我们的大本营。</i>
<i>to our home base.</i>

267
00:16:16,798 --> 00:16:20,802
<i>你将在那里接受处理并释放到联邦指挥部。</i>
<i>You will there be processed and released to Federation Command.</i>

268
00:16:21,094 --> 00:16:26,641
<i>在判决通过之前，柯克舰长将被监禁。</i>
<i>Until judgment is passed, Captain Kirk will be held in confinement.</i>

269
00:16:29,394 --> 00:16:33,689
保安。把我们的两个罗慕伦人质关禁闭。
Security. Put our two Romulan hostages in the brig.

270
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:37,693
乌乎拉上尉，帮我接通那艘船。
Lieutenant Uhura, give me a channel to that ship.

271
00:16:40,446 --> 00:16:43,533
频道开放了，斯科特先生，你被接入了。
Channel is open, Mr. Scott, and you are tied in.

272
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:47,370
这是斯科特少校。
This is Lieutenant Commander Scott.

273
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:52,250
<i>企业号</i>只接受柯克舰长的命令。
The <i>Enterprise</i> takes no orders except those of Captain Kirk.

274
00:16:52,375 --> 00:16:55,711
<i>我们会一直待在这里，直到他回来。</i>
<i>And we will stay right here until he returns.</i>

275
00:16:56,045 --> 00:17:00,341
<i>如果你试图登上或征用</i>企业号，
<i>And if you make any attempt to board or commandeer the</i> Enterprise,

276
00:17:00,425 --> 00:17:05,763
<i>我们将尽可能地将你们和飞船一起炸成碎片。</i>
<i>it will be blown to bits along with as many of you as we can take with us.</i>

277
00:17:05,847 --> 00:17:08,850
你们人类发出了勇敢的声音。
You humans make a brave noise.

278
00:17:09,642 --> 00:17:13,396
有很多方法可以让你相信自己的错误。
There are ways to convince you of your errors.

279
00:17:13,604 --> 00:17:14,939
你听到了吗，胆小鬼？
Did you hear that, you coward?

280
00:17:15,064 --> 00:17:17,233
你背叛了你所知道的一切有价值的东西。
You've betrayed everything of value you ever knew.

281
00:17:17,316 --> 00:17:19,110
你听到人类正直的声音了吗？
Did you hear the sound of human integrity?

282
00:17:19,193 --> 00:17:21,487
带他去保安室。
Take him to the security room.

283
00:17:31,205 --> 00:17:33,374
人类中的瓦肯人，
A Vulcan among humans,

284
00:17:33,749 --> 00:17:35,543
与他们一起生活、工作。
living, working with them.

285
00:17:36,294 --> 00:17:39,046
我本以为这种情况会让你无法忍受。
I would think the situation would be intolerable to you.

286
00:17:39,255 --> 00:17:42,300
我是半个瓦肯人。我妈妈是人类。
I am half-Vulcan. My mother is a human.

287
00:17:42,425 --> 00:17:44,343
那你效忠于谁呢？
To whom is your allegiance then?

288
00:17:45,178 --> 00:17:47,930
你称自己为地球人还是瓦肯人？
Do you call yourself Terran or Vulcan?

289
00:17:48,389 --> 00:17:50,016
瓦肯人。
Vulcan.

290
00:17:53,478 --> 00:17:56,439
你当星际舰队军官多久了，史波克？
How long have you been a Starfleet officer, Spock?

291
00:17:56,647 --> 00:18:00,151
- 十八年。 - 你为柯克舰长服务。
- Eighteen years. - And you serve Captain Kirk.

292
00:18:00,818 --> 00:18:03,446
你喜欢他吗？你喜欢你的船员吗？
Do you like him? Do you like your shipmates?

293
00:18:03,696 --> 00:18:07,283
- 这个问题无关紧要。 - 可能。
- The question is irrelevant. - Possibly.

294
00:18:07,366 --> 00:18:12,330
但你服从柯克舰长的命令，甚至服从于他的一时兴起。
But you are subordinate to Captain Kirk's orders, even to his whims.

295
00:18:12,413 --> 00:18:15,082
作为一名军官，我的职责是服从他。
My duty as an officer is to obey him.

296
00:18:17,877 --> 00:18:20,296
你是个更优秀的人。
You are a superior being.

297
00:18:21,422 --> 00:18:23,508
为什么不指挥？
Why do you not command?

298
00:18:24,467 --> 00:18:26,844
我不想要一艘我自己的船。
I do not desire a ship of my own.

299
00:18:26,928 --> 00:18:32,183
还是说没有人给你这个瓦肯人提供这种机会？
Or is it that no one has offered you, a Vulcan, that opportunity?

300
00:18:32,391 --> 00:18:36,354
这样的机会极为罕见。
Such opportunities are extremely rare.

301
00:18:36,521 --> 00:18:39,941
对于有你能力和成就的人，
For someone with your capabilities and accomplishments,

302
00:18:40,066 --> 00:18:42,360
机会来了。
opportunities are made.

303
00:18:43,152 --> 00:18:44,820
将来也是。
And will be.

304
00:18:45,071 --> 00:18:47,657
如果你不再把联邦看成是整个宇宙，
I will see to that if you will stop looking on the Federation

305
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:49,534
我就会看到这一点。
as the whole universe.

306
00:18:49,742 --> 00:18:51,577
不是的，你知道的。
It is not, you know.

307
00:18:53,621 --> 00:18:57,291
这个想法偶尔会在我脑海中闪过。
That thought has occasionally crossed my mind.

308
00:19:03,923 --> 00:19:05,925
你必须有自己的船。
You must have your own ship.

309
00:19:07,093 --> 00:19:09,220
指挥官，我们说清楚好吗？
Commander, shall we speak plainly?

310
00:19:11,097 --> 00:19:13,808
是你迫切需要一艘船。
It is you who desperately need a ship.

311
00:19:14,308 --> 00:19:16,644
你想要<i>企业号</i>。
You want the <i>Enterprise</i>.

312
00:19:20,022 --> 00:19:21,399
当然。
Of course.

313
00:19:22,483 --> 00:19:26,946
将<i>企业号</i>完好无损地带回家对我来说将是一项了不起的成就。
It would be a great achievement for me to bring home the <i>Enterprise</i> intact.

314
00:19:27,488 --> 00:19:30,283
这将大大拓宽我的权力范围。
It would broaden the scope of my powers greatly.

315
00:19:30,491 --> 00:19:32,910
这将是一生的成就。
It would be the achievement of a lifetime.

316
00:19:34,954 --> 00:19:37,873
它将为你提供平等的机会。
And it would open equal opportunities for you.

317
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:54,724
[尖叫]
[SCREAMS]

318
00:20:01,564 --> 00:20:03,608
乌乎拉 [通过对讲机]：<i>舰桥呼叫麦考伊医生。</i>
UHURA [OVER INTERCOM]: <i>Bridge to Dr. McCoy.</i>

319
00:20:05,234 --> 00:20:07,486
- 我是麦考伊。 - 医生，你必须立即登船
- McCoy here. - Doctor, you must beam aboard

320
00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:10,239
罗慕伦旗舰有人受伤了。
the Romulan flagship immediately. There's been an injury.

321
00:20:10,364 --> 00:20:13,951
- 我不上门服务。 - 医生，我是柯克舰长。
- I don't make house calls. - Doctor, it's Captain Kirk.

322
00:20:29,383 --> 00:20:31,677
他会康复，但需要进一步关注。
He'll recover, but he'll need further attention.

323
00:20:32,011 --> 00:20:34,013
通知你的上级。
Inform your superior.

324
00:20:38,893 --> 00:20:40,436
[对讲机哔哔声]
[INTERCOM BEEPS]

325
00:20:43,022 --> 00:20:44,357
什么事？
Yes?

326
00:20:45,983 --> 00:20:47,652
我会来的。
I'll come there.

327
00:20:49,362 --> 00:20:50,988
跟我来。
Attend me.

328
00:20:56,786 --> 00:21:00,539
我忘了说，我希望你来吃晚饭。
I neglected to mention, I'll expect you for dinner.

329
00:21:00,956 --> 00:21:03,209
我们有很多事情要讨论。
We have much to discuss.

330
00:21:03,751 --> 00:21:05,294
是吗？
Indeed?

331
00:21:08,923 --> 00:21:12,677
请允许我重新表述。
Allow me to rephrase.

332
00:21:13,928 --> 00:21:16,097
你能和我一起吃晚饭吗？
Will you join me for dinner?

333
00:21:16,931 --> 00:21:19,016
我很荣幸，指挥官。
I am honored, commander.

334
00:21:19,517 --> 00:21:22,144
守卫也请来了？
Are the guards also invited?

335
00:21:35,574 --> 00:21:37,159
史波克先生。
Mr. Spock.

336
00:21:39,662 --> 00:21:43,958
除了忠诚的罗慕伦人，这条走廊是禁止进入的。
That corridor is forbidden to all but loyal Romulans.

337
00:21:46,377 --> 00:21:49,046
当然。我会服从你的限制。
Of course. I shall obey your restrictions.

338
00:21:50,923 --> 00:21:52,842
我希望有一天
I hope that one day

339
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:57,304
你无需遵守任何限制。
there will be no need for you to observe any restrictions.

340
00:21:57,555 --> 00:21:59,640
这将是不合逻辑的
It would be illogical

341
00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:04,103
假设所有条件保持稳定。
to assume that all conditions remain stable.

342
00:22:25,708 --> 00:22:29,003
- 你是医生吗？ - 麦考伊。
- Are you the doctor? - McCoy.

343
00:22:29,837 --> 00:22:31,630
首席医疗官。
Chief medical officer.

344
00:22:31,881 --> 00:22:33,674
柯克舰长的情况？
Captain Kirk's condition?

345
00:22:33,924 --> 00:22:35,760
嗯，你可以自己看看。
Well, you can see for yourself.

346
00:22:35,843 --> 00:22:38,554
他精神抑郁，身体虚弱，
He's mentally depressed, physically weak,

347
00:22:38,637 --> 00:22:42,266
迷失方向，表现出迫害和反叛的感觉。
disoriented, displays feelings of persecution and rebellion.

348
00:22:42,391 --> 00:22:45,186
那么按照你自己的正常标准，
Then by your own standards of normality,

349
00:22:45,519 --> 00:22:47,396
这个人并不完全能胜任。
this man is not fully competent.

350
00:22:47,897 --> 00:22:49,356
不能，现在不能。
No, not now.

351
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:52,193
史波克 先生表示他相信
Mr. Spock has stated that he believes

352
00:22:52,276 --> 00:22:57,865
舰长没有权力或命令穿越中立区。
the captain had no authority or order to cross the neutral zone.

353
00:22:58,032 --> 00:23:01,827
早先是不是这种精神上的无能在困扰着他？
Could this mental incapacity have afflicted him earlier?

354
00:23:01,911 --> 00:23:03,621
是的，这是可能的。
Yes, it's possible.

355
00:23:05,164 --> 00:23:06,582
史波克先生，
Mr. Spock,

356
00:23:06,832 --> 00:23:10,211
医生现在已经证实了你的证词。
the doctor has now confirmed your testimony.

357
00:23:10,294 --> 00:23:13,005
至于你们舰长的精神状态，
As to the mental state of your captain,

358
00:23:13,214 --> 00:23:16,801
他过去和现在都不适合继续指挥<i>企业号</i>。
he was and is unfit to continue in command of the <i>Enterprise</i>.

359
00:23:17,384 --> 00:23:19,720
现在这个责任落在了你身上。
That duty has now fallen on you.

360
00:23:20,012 --> 00:23:22,556
你准备好行使这个功能了吗？
Are you ready to exercise that function?

361
00:23:22,932 --> 00:23:25,601
- 我已经准备好了。 - 史波克，我不相信。
- I am ready. - Spock, I don't believe it.

362
00:23:26,018 --> 00:23:28,687
你付不起让他出卖自己的代价。
There's no price you could pay that would make him sell out.

363
00:23:28,771 --> 00:23:31,482
此事不公开讨论，医生。
The matter is not open for discussion, doctor.

364
00:23:31,565 --> 00:23:34,401
- 你的意思是这件事是--？ - 够了，医生。
- What do you mean the matter is--? - That's enough, doctor.

365
00:23:35,611 --> 00:23:38,614
作为医生，你的职责是挽救生命。
As a physician, your duty is to save lives.

366
00:23:39,406 --> 00:23:41,826
史波克先生的职责是领导<i>企业号</i>
Mr. Spock's duty is to lead the <i>Enterprise</i>

367
00:23:41,909 --> 00:23:44,495
和它的船员到一个安全的避风港。
and its crew to a safe haven.

368
00:23:44,578 --> 00:23:46,330
别无选择，医生。
There is no alternative, doctor.

369
00:23:46,497 --> 00:23:48,833
船员的安全现在是最重要的问题。
The safety of the crew is now the paramount issue.

370
00:23:48,916 --> 00:23:51,794
再抵制下去就是误导性的忠诚了。
It is misguided loyalty to resist any further.

371
00:23:51,877 --> 00:23:53,712
你这个叛徒
You traitor.

372
00:23:54,421 --> 00:23:56,173
我会杀了你。
I'll kill you.

373
00:23:57,341 --> 00:23:58,968
我会杀了你。
I'll kill you.

374
00:24:00,177 --> 00:24:01,720
[柯克咕噜声]
[KIRK GRUNTS]

375
00:24:10,271 --> 00:24:11,981
你做了什么？
What did you do?

376
00:24:14,775 --> 00:24:16,527
你做了什么？
What did you do?

377
00:24:17,403 --> 00:24:20,030
我对他的攻击毫无准备。
I was unprepared for his attack.

378
00:24:20,739 --> 00:24:24,660
我本能地使用了瓦肯死亡之握。
I instinctively used the Vulcan death grip.

379
00:24:27,746 --> 00:24:30,666
你的直觉还是不错的，史波克先生。
Your instincts are still good, Mr. Spock.

380
00:24:33,002 --> 00:24:35,087
舰长死了。
The captain is dead.

381
00:25:14,126 --> 00:25:16,462
医生！麦考伊医生！
Doctor! Dr. McCoy!

382
00:25:17,713 --> 00:25:19,340
麦考伊医生。
Dr. McCoy.

383
00:25:19,548 --> 00:25:21,592
我留下了任何人不得进入这里的命令。
I left orders that no one was to come in here.

384
00:25:21,675 --> 00:25:24,470
- 他活着。活着。 - 好吧，既然你知道了，
- He's alive. Alive. - Well, now that you know it,

385
00:25:24,595 --> 00:25:27,014
你不妨帮帮我。把生理刺激器递给我。
you might as well assist me. Hand me the physio-stimulator.

386
00:25:27,097 --> 00:25:29,433
但他已经死了。他们的医生证明他已经死了。
But he was dead. Their doctors certified he was dead.

387
00:25:29,516 --> 00:25:32,227
史波克对他用了神经阻断术来模拟死亡。
Spock gave him a nerve pinch to simulate death.

388
00:25:32,311 --> 00:25:34,396
那么史波克先生不是叛徒。
Then Mr. Spock isn't a traitor.

389
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,482
而你一直都知道，但你没有--
And you knew that all the time and you didn't--

390
00:25:36,607 --> 00:25:39,234
我登上罗慕伦飞船时才知道。
I didn't know it until I beamed aboard the Romulan ship.

391
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:42,237
吉姆和史波克是在联邦的命令下行动的。
Jim and Spock were operating under Federation orders.

392
00:25:56,877 --> 00:25:58,462
[柯克呻吟]
[KIRK GROANING]

393
00:26:04,802 --> 00:26:07,513
我的脖子感觉像是被扭断了。
My neck feels like it's been twisted off.

394
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,848
这是给你的瓦肯死亡之握。
That's the Vulcan death grip for you.

395
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:12,184
没有瓦肯死亡之握这样的东西。
There's no such thing as a Vulcan death grip.

396
00:26:12,351 --> 00:26:14,687
哦，但罗慕伦人不知道这一点。
Oh, but the Romulans don't know that.

397
00:26:14,770 --> 00:26:16,146
确实骗过了医生们。
Sure fooled the doctors.

398
00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:19,400
你冒了很大的风险，他们没有开始尸检。
You took a big chance that they didn't start an autopsy.

399
00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:22,778
至于其他船员，我还是死了。
As far as the rest of crew is concerned, I'm still dead.

400
00:26:22,861 --> 00:26:24,279
为什么？
Why?

401
00:26:25,406 --> 00:26:27,533
这就是整个化妆舞会的目的。
That's what this whole masquerade was about.

402
00:26:27,658 --> 00:26:30,869
让<i>企业号</i>和联盟摆脱困境。
To keep the <i>Enterprise</i> and the Federation off the hook.

403
00:26:32,079 --> 00:26:34,289
因此，如果出现任何问题
So that if any thing went wrong

404
00:26:34,665 --> 00:26:36,875
你会受到指责。
you would be the one to blame.

405
00:26:37,167 --> 00:26:38,669
老骨头，
Bones,

406
00:26:39,003 --> 00:26:40,963
我要你为手术做准备。
I want you to prepare for surgery.

407
00:26:41,130 --> 00:26:42,673
做什么的？
What for?

408
00:26:44,299 --> 00:26:46,051
麦考伊 [通过对讲机]：<i>医务室呼叫舰桥。</i>
McCOY [OVER INTERCOM]: <i>Sickbay to bridge.</i>

409
00:26:46,343 --> 00:26:47,803
我是斯科特，医生。
Scott here, doctor.

410
00:26:47,886 --> 00:26:50,014
<i>斯科特先生，你能到医务室报告吗？</i>
<i>Mr. Scott, will you report to Sickbay?</i>

411
00:26:50,097 --> 00:26:53,350
医务室？这种时候我不能离开舰桥。
Sickbay? I can't leave the bridge at a time like this.

412
00:26:53,434 --> 00:26:55,060
你必须来，这事很紧急。
You have to, it's urgent.

413
00:26:55,352 --> 00:26:58,230
我们被准备攻击我们的敌舰包围，
We're surrounded by enemy vessels ready to attack us,

414
00:26:58,313 --> 00:27:00,733
我不知道还有什么比这更紧急。
I don't know of anything more urgent than that.

415
00:27:00,858 --> 00:27:02,234
我知道。
Well, I do.

416
00:27:02,359 --> 00:27:04,570
斯科特先生，拜托。
Mr. Scott, please.

417
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:06,905
好的，医生。
All right, doctor.

418
00:27:07,114 --> 00:27:09,783
最好是重要的事。斯科特完毕。
It better be important. Scott out.

419
00:27:14,288 --> 00:27:17,332
好的，医生，什么事这么紧急--？
All right, doctor, what's so urgent that--?

420
00:27:23,464 --> 00:27:25,090
舰长。
Captain.

421
00:27:28,886 --> 00:27:30,596
柯克舰长。
Captain Kirk.

422
00:27:31,972 --> 00:27:33,057
是的。
Yes.

423
00:27:33,182 --> 00:27:37,478
好吧，你自己看起来就像是魔鬼，不过你是活的。
Well, you look like the devil himself, but as long as you're alive.

424
00:27:37,561 --> 00:27:39,229
这到底是怎么回事？
What's it all about?

425
00:27:40,439 --> 00:27:42,900
那些罗慕伦军官还在船上吗？
Are those Romulan officers still aboard the ship?

426
00:27:42,983 --> 00:27:44,526
他们在禁闭室，长官。
They're in the brig, sir.

427
00:27:44,777 --> 00:27:46,904
我需要一件罗慕伦制服。
I'll need a Romulan uniform.

428
00:27:47,821 --> 00:27:50,783
是的，我很乐意。
Aye. It'll be a pleasure.

429
00:27:53,702 --> 00:27:56,455
[门打开和关闭]
[DOORS OPEN AND CLOSE]

430
00:28:04,838 --> 00:28:08,092
指挥官：我为你准备了特别的瓦肯菜肴。
COMMANDER: I've had special Vulcan dishes prepared for you.

431
00:28:09,009 --> 00:28:11,136
我希望它们是你喜欢的。
I hope they're to your liking.

432
00:28:11,386 --> 00:28:13,388
我很受宠若惊，指挥官。
I'm very flattered, commander.

433
00:28:14,598 --> 00:28:17,434
毫无疑问，你船上的美食
There is no doubt that the cuisine aboard your vessel

434
00:28:17,601 --> 00:28:20,479
远优于<i>企业号</i>。
is far superior to that of the <i>Enterprise</i>.

435
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:28,320
这确实有非常强大的招聘吸引力。
It is, indeed, a very powerful recruiting inducement.

436
00:28:30,489 --> 00:28:32,783
我们还有其他奖励。
We have other inducements.

437
00:28:58,475 --> 00:29:00,602
史波克到底在干什么？
What the devil is Spock doing?

438
00:29:00,853 --> 00:29:02,604
是什么耽误了他？
What's delaying him?

439
00:29:02,813 --> 00:29:04,565
我希望我知道。
I wish I knew.

440
00:29:07,151 --> 00:29:09,695
斯科提，你确定我们和史波克的通讯畅通吗？
Scotty, are you sure we have a clear channel to Spock?

441
00:29:09,778 --> 00:29:11,363
是的，长官。毫无疑问。
Aye, sir. No doubt of it.

442
00:29:11,488 --> 00:29:14,241
那我们不能再等了。准备好让我登上旗舰。
Then we can't wait any longer. Prepare to beam me aboard the flagship.

443
00:29:14,324 --> 00:29:16,994
斯科提：但是史波克先生还没有设置正确的坐标。
SCOTTY: But Mr. Spock hasn't set the proper coordinates yet.

444
00:29:17,077 --> 00:29:19,830
- 没办法，斯科提。 - 你冒着很大的风险，吉姆。
- Can't be helped, Scotty. - You're taking an awful chance, Jim.

445
00:29:19,913 --> 00:29:23,250
只要别把我放到舱壁里，传送。
Just don't put me inside a bulkhead. Energize.

446
00:29:36,889 --> 00:29:38,807
百夫长，对不起，不允许任何人--
Centurion, I'm sorry, no one is allowed--

447
00:29:38,932 --> 00:29:41,018
我刚刚成功逃离了联邦船只。
I have just effected an escape from the Federation vessel.

448
00:29:41,143 --> 00:29:43,395
我有给塔尔副指挥官的信息。他在哪里？
I have information for Sub-Commander Tal. Where is he?

449
00:29:43,478 --> 00:29:45,147
他在控制中心，百夫长。
He's in control central, centurion.

450
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:47,774
好的。我会向他提及你的警觉性。回到你的岗位。
Good. I shall mention your alertness to him. Return to your duty.

451
00:29:47,858 --> 00:29:49,526
谢谢你，百夫长。
Thank you, centurion.

452
00:30:16,553 --> 00:30:18,972
你在星际舰队一无所有
You have nothing in Starfleet

453
00:30:19,473 --> 00:30:21,558
无家可归。
to which to return.

454
00:30:22,851 --> 00:30:24,603
我给--
I off--

455
00:30:26,730 --> 00:30:31,068
我们给你提供一个选择
We offer you an alternative.

456
00:30:33,195 --> 00:30:35,364
我们会为你找到一个地方，
We will find a place for you,

457
00:30:36,031 --> 00:30:37,824
如果你愿意的话。
if you wish it.

458
00:30:38,617 --> 00:30:40,118
一个地方？
A place?

459
00:30:44,081 --> 00:30:45,749
与我一起。
With me.

460
00:30:50,128 --> 00:30:53,465
罗慕伦女性不像瓦肯女性。
Romulan women are not like Vulcan females.

461
00:30:54,007 --> 00:30:56,134
我们不致力于...
We are not dedicated to...

462
00:30:57,302 --> 00:30:58,845
...纯逻辑
...pure logic

463
00:30:59,096 --> 00:31:01,765
和冷漠无情。
and the sterility of non-emotion.

464
00:31:09,815 --> 00:31:11,817
我们的人民是战士，
Our people are warriors,

465
00:31:12,808 --> 00:31:14,820
通常是野蛮人。
often savage.

466
00:31:15,737 --> 00:31:18,991
但我们还有许多其他令人愉快的事情。
But we are also many other pleasant things.

467
00:31:23,328 --> 00:31:27,791
我没注意到罗慕伦社会的这一方面。
I was not aware of that aspect of Romulan society.

468
00:31:30,168 --> 00:31:32,713
作为瓦肯人，你会研究它。
As a Vulcan, you would study it.

469
00:31:34,506 --> 00:31:37,718
作为一个人类，你会找到欣赏它的方法。
As a human, you would find ways to appreciate it.

470
00:31:46,727 --> 00:31:48,603
请相信我，
Please believe me,

471
00:31:49,730 --> 00:31:51,398
我确实...
I do...

472
00:31:51,815 --> 00:31:53,567
……欣赏它。
...appreciate it.

473
00:31:54,776 --> 00:31:56,820
我很高兴。
I am so glad.

474
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:03,827
现在，完成这一场合的最后一步。
Now, one final step to make the occasion complete.

475
00:32:04,995 --> 00:32:09,416
你将带领一小队罗慕伦人登上<i>企业号</i>。
You will lead a small party of Romulans aboard the <i>Enterprise</i>.

476
00:32:10,083 --> 00:32:12,794
在那里，你将获得你应有的地位
And there you will take your rightful place

477
00:32:13,170 --> 00:32:15,130
作为指挥官。
as its commander.

478
00:32:15,630 --> 00:32:18,508
然后你将带领飞船到罗慕伦港口，
And you will lead the ship to a Romulan port,

479
00:32:18,925 --> 00:32:21,053
我的旗舰就在旁边。
with my flagship at its side.

480
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:25,724
是的，当然。
Yes, of course.

481
00:32:26,058 --> 00:32:28,727
但不是现在。
But not just this moment.

482
00:32:30,270 --> 00:32:34,483
一个小时后更好。
An hour from now will do even better.

483
00:32:35,442 --> 00:32:37,027
会不会...
Would it not...

484
00:32:38,612 --> 00:32:40,322
...指挥官？
...commander?

485
00:32:41,073 --> 00:32:42,532
是的。
Yes.

486
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:45,911
是的，会的。
Yes, it will.

487
00:32:46,870 --> 00:32:48,663
史波克先生。
Mr. Spock.

488
00:32:50,707 --> 00:32:52,918
你知道我有名字的。
You do know I have a first name.

489
00:32:54,211 --> 00:32:56,505
我开始怀疑。
I was beginning to wonder.

490
00:32:57,756 --> 00:32:59,466
嗯，我知道。
Well, I do.

491
00:33:00,592 --> 00:33:02,677
你想听吗？
Would you like to hear it?

492
00:33:05,722 --> 00:33:07,849
[不清楚地窃窃私语]
[WHISPERS INDISTINCTLY]

493
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:11,978
多么罕见
How rare

494
00:33:12,396 --> 00:33:14,314
多么美丽。
and how beautiful.

495
00:33:17,359 --> 00:33:21,571
但是当被一个士兵说出来时就显得格格不入了。
But so incongruous when spoken by a soldier.

496
00:33:24,533 --> 00:33:26,868
如果你给我一点时间
If you will give me a moment,

497
00:33:28,787 --> 00:33:32,082
士兵会改变自己
the soldier will transform herself

498
00:33:32,916 --> 00:33:34,543
变成女人。
into a woman.

499
00:33:54,229 --> 00:33:56,898
- 史波克呼叫柯克舰长。 - 柯克：<i>我是柯克。</i>
- Spock to Captain Kirk. - KIRK: <i>Kirk here.</i>

500
00:33:57,190 --> 00:33:59,943
舰长，你准备好传送过来了吗？
Captain, are you prepared to beam over?

501
00:34:00,152 --> 00:34:02,946
我已经在船上了，史波克。你有消息吗？
I'm already on board, Spock. Do you have the information?

502
00:34:03,029 --> 00:34:04,489
是的，舰长。
Yes, captain.

503
00:34:04,573 --> 00:34:07,242
隐形装置位于指挥官住处附近的区域。
The cloaking device is in an area near the commander's quarters.

504
00:34:07,409 --> 00:34:11,746
它受到严密保护，除授权人员外，所有人员均不得进入。
It is closely guarded and off-limits to all but authorized personnel.

505
00:34:11,913 --> 00:34:13,623
你现在的位置是什么？
What is your present location?

506
00:34:14,416 --> 00:34:15,876
副指挥官塔尔。
Sub-commander Tal.

507
00:34:15,959 --> 00:34:18,336
我从我们的飞船内接收到外星人的信号，长官。
I'm receiving an alien transmission from within our vessel, sir.

508
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:20,630
- 外星人？你确定吗？ - 是的，副指挥官。
- Alien? Are you certain? - Yes, sub-commander.

509
00:34:20,714 --> 00:34:23,633
- 我必须知道来源。 - 正在进行三角测量，先生。
- I must know the source. - Triangulating now, sir.

510
00:34:23,884 --> 00:34:27,345
史波克，我去拿隐形装置。
Spock, I'll get the cloaking device.

511
00:34:27,572 --> 00:34:29,396
你能回到<i>企业号</i>
Will you be able to get back to the <i>Enterprise</i>

512
00:34:29,473 --> 00:34:31,391
但不引起他们注意吗？
without attracting their attention?

513
00:34:32,267 --> 00:34:36,021
不知道，舰长。目前，我相当沉重--
Unknown, captain. At present, I'm rather heavily--

514
00:34:42,027 --> 00:34:43,695
我的...
Is my...

515
00:34:44,279 --> 00:34:46,740
...装束现在更合适了吗？
...attire now more appropriate,

516
00:34:47,324 --> 00:34:48,825
史波克先生
Mr. Spock?

517
00:34:49,826 --> 00:34:53,914
指挥官，你的装束不仅更合适，
Commander, your attire is not only more appropriate,

518
00:34:54,414 --> 00:34:58,793
它实际能刺激我们的交流。
it should actually stimulate our conversation.

519
00:35:25,862 --> 00:35:27,155
百夫长。
Centurion.

520
00:35:27,322 --> 00:35:29,950
你有这个区域的许可吗？我不认识你。
Have you clearance for this area? I do not recognize you.

521
00:35:30,101 --> 00:35:32,608
船上有入侵者。有人试图进入吗？
There's an intruder aboard. Has someone tried to gain entrance?

522
00:35:32,702 --> 00:35:35,580
- 我必须查看你的授权，先生。 - 在那边。
- I must see your authorization, sir. - Over there.

523
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:46,299
很难相信
It's hard to believe

524
00:35:47,801 --> 00:35:50,220
我能如此感动
that I could be so moved

525
00:35:50,679 --> 00:35:53,306
被外星人的手触摸。
by the touch of an alien hand.

526
00:35:55,475 --> 00:35:57,978
我必须承认，我也
I must confess that I, too,

527
00:35:58,270 --> 00:36:01,481
很感动。
am moved emotionally.

528
00:36:02,399 --> 00:36:04,484
我知道这是不合逻辑的--
I know it is illogical--

529
00:36:04,568 --> 00:36:06,444
史波克先生...
Mr. Spock...

530
00:36:08,363 --> 00:36:10,448
......我们不应该质疑
...we mustn't question

531
00:36:11,199 --> 00:36:13,493
我们的真实感受。
what we truly feel.

532
00:36:15,912 --> 00:36:18,665
接受我们之间发生的事情，
Accept what is happening between us,

533
00:36:18,999 --> 00:36:20,750
就像我一样。
even as I do.

534
00:36:20,875 --> 00:36:22,127
塔尔：指挥官。
TAL: Commander.

535
00:36:22,252 --> 00:36:23,628
[嗡嗡声]
[BUZZING]

536
00:36:23,712 --> 00:36:25,463
允许进入。
Permission to enter.

537
00:36:26,214 --> 00:36:28,091
不是现在，塔尔。
Not now, Tal.

538
00:36:28,258 --> 00:36:30,302
塔尔：很紧急，指挥官。
TAL: It is urgent, commander.

539
00:36:39,185 --> 00:36:40,812
指挥官：进来。
COMMANDER: Enter.

540
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:45,275
指挥官。我们截获了外星人的传送。
Commander. We have intercepted an alien transmission.

541
00:36:45,942 --> 00:36:47,277
指挥官：找到它的来源。
COMMANDER: Locate its source.

542
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:48,737
塔尔：找到了，指挥官。
TAL: We have, commander.

543
00:36:48,903 --> 00:36:50,322
这个房间。
This room.

544
00:36:59,831 --> 00:37:02,667
隐形装置。带上他。
The cloaking device. Bring him.

545
00:37:22,854 --> 00:37:25,023
保持。别动。
Hold. Don't move.

546
00:37:25,815 --> 00:37:28,026
你是谁？你在这里做什么？
Who are you? What are you doing in here?

547
00:37:29,069 --> 00:37:32,072
船上有敌方间谍。他会去寻找隐形装置。
There's an enemy spy aboard. He'll be after the cloaking device.

548
00:37:34,491 --> 00:37:36,201
放下你的武器。
Drop your weapon.

549
00:38:18,326 --> 00:38:19,786
斯科提，
Scotty,

550
00:38:20,078 --> 00:38:21,663
传送。
energize.

551
00:38:33,550 --> 00:38:35,176
斯科提：但是，先生，史波克先生呢？
SCOTTY: But, sir, what about Mr. Spock?

552
00:38:35,301 --> 00:38:37,971
希望他能给我们足够的时间来安装这个隐形装置。
Hope he can buy us enough time to get this cloaking device installed.

553
00:38:38,096 --> 00:38:40,432
它必须连接到我们的偏转护盾控制上。
It'll have to be hooked into our deflector-shield control.

554
00:38:40,515 --> 00:38:41,975
- 你能做到吗？ - 我不知道。
- Can you do it? - I don't know.

555
00:38:42,058 --> 00:38:43,893
你有 15 分钟，斯科提。
You have 15 minutes, Scotty.

556
00:38:51,109 --> 00:38:53,570
指挥官，隐形装置不见了。
Commander, the cloaking device is gone.

557
00:38:53,862 --> 00:38:56,281
全面警戒。搜索所有甲板。
Full alert. Search all decks.

558
00:39:00,410 --> 00:39:02,620
那将是无的，指挥官。
That will be profitless, commander.

559
00:39:02,912 --> 00:39:05,582
我不相信你会找到它。
I do not believe you will find it.

560
00:39:07,584 --> 00:39:09,419
你一定是疯了。
You must be mad.

561
00:39:09,544 --> 00:39:11,212
我向你保证，
I assure you,

562
00:39:11,504 --> 00:39:13,715
我很理智。
I am quite sane.

563
00:39:14,132 --> 00:39:16,259
你为什么要这样对我？
Why would you do this to me?

564
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:20,096
你有什么资格这样做？
What are you that you could do this?

565
00:39:26,644 --> 00:39:29,856
企业号的大副。
First Officer of the Enterprise.

566
00:39:40,074 --> 00:39:42,535
你们目前的死刑方式是什么？
What is your present form of execution?

567
00:39:58,843 --> 00:40:02,180
柯克：<i>舰长日志，星历 5027.4。</i>
KIRK: Captain's Log, stardate 5027.4.</i>

568
00:40:02,263 --> 00:40:04,349
<i>斯科特上校有不到 15 分钟的时间</i>
<i>Commander Scott has less than 15 minutes</i>

569
00:40:04,432 --> 00:40:07,769
<i>安装罗慕伦人的隐形装置并使其工作。</i>
<i>to install the Romulans' cloaking device and get it working.</i>

570
00:40:07,894 --> 00:40:10,939
<i>我希望史波克先生能为我们争取到我们需要的时间。</i>
<i>I hope Mr. Spock can buy us the time we need.</i>

571
00:40:11,231 --> 00:40:12,899
- 苏鲁：舰长。 - 契科夫：你还活着。
- SULU: Captain. - CHEKOV: You're alive.

572
00:40:12,982 --> 00:40:15,610
- 他们说你被杀了，长官。 - 报告太草率了。
- They said you'd been killed, sir. - The report was premature.

573
00:40:15,693 --> 00:40:19,239
- 舰长，你的耳朵，发生了什么事？ - 我们稍后再讨论。
- Captain, your ears, what happened? - We'll discuss it later.

574
00:40:19,322 --> 00:40:21,991
苏鲁先生，设定回家的航线。 契科夫，带上传感器。
Mr. Sulu, lay in a course for home. Chekov, take the sensors.

575
00:40:22,116 --> 00:40:24,035
史波克先生仍在罗慕伦旗舰上。
Mr. Spock is still aboard the Romulan flagship.

576
00:40:24,118 --> 00:40:27,288
我希望他的身体读数被精确定位和隔离。
I want his body readings pinpointed and isolated.

577
00:40:27,956 --> 00:40:30,166
这不是请求，先生们。
That was not a request, gentlemen.

578
00:40:30,291 --> 00:40:31,668
- 是的，长官。- 是的，长官。
- Aye, sir. - Aye, sir.

579
00:40:31,793 --> 00:40:33,211
- 是的，长官。

580
00:40:38,716 --> 00:40:40,802
回到你的岗位，副指挥官。

00:40:40,969 --> 00:40:44,514
听我的命令开始<i>企业号<i>的登船行动。
The boarding action on the <i>Enterprise</i> will begin with my command.

582
00:40:44,848 --> 00:40:47,642
如果他们反抗，摧毁她。
If they resist, destroy her.

583
00:40:53,231 --> 00:40:56,526
处决国家罪犯
Execution of state criminals

584
00:40:56,818 --> 00:41:00,238
既痛苦又不愉快。
is both painful and unpleasant.

585
00:41:00,655 --> 00:41:03,491
我相信细节是不必要的。
I believe the details are unnecessary.

586
00:41:04,826 --> 00:41:07,787
处决将立即执行
The sentence will be carried out immediately after the charges

587
00:41:07,871 --> 00:41:09,205
在指控被记录后。
have been recorded.

588
00:41:09,330 --> 00:41:12,125
我首先要求获得声明权。
I demand the Right of Statement first.

589
00:41:13,751 --> 00:41:16,963
你很了解罗慕伦的传统。
You understand Romulan tradition well.

590
00:41:18,006 --> 00:41:19,632
要求通过。
The right is granted.

591
00:41:19,883 --> 00:41:21,426
谢谢。
Thank you.

592
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:28,266
我不需要太多时间。
I shall not require much time.

593
00:41:28,349 --> 00:41:32,145
我应该说不超过20分钟。
No more than 20 minutes, I should say.

594
00:41:32,645 --> 00:41:35,732
找到你的盟友应该比这花费更少的时间
It should take less time than that to find your ally

595
00:41:35,857 --> 00:41:37,942
他们偷了隐形装置。
who stole the cloaking device.

596
00:41:38,484 --> 00:41:40,737
你不会孤独地死去。
You will not die alone.

597
00:41:42,488 --> 00:41:46,534
记录罗慕伦的陈述权。
Recording the Romulan Right of Statement.

598
00:41:48,036 --> 00:41:50,204
继续，史波克上校。
Proceed, Commander Spock.

599
00:41:50,997 --> 00:41:55,418
我的罪行是蓄意破坏。我自愿承认我的罪行。
My crime is sabotage. I freely admit my guilt.

600
00:42:06,930 --> 00:42:09,557
我作为星际舰队军官的誓言
The oath I swore as a Starfleet officer

601
00:42:09,682 --> 00:42:12,518
既具体又具有约束力。
is both specific and binding.

602
00:42:12,727 --> 00:42:14,604
只要我穿着制服，
As long as I wear the uniform,

603
00:42:14,687 --> 00:42:18,775
我的职责就是保护联邦的安全。
my duty is to protect the security of the Federation.

604
00:42:18,983 --> 00:42:23,863
很明显，你的新隐形设备对该安全构成了威胁。
Clearly, your new cloaking device is a threat to that security.

605
00:42:23,988 --> 00:42:25,782
我履行了我的职责。
I carried out my duty.

606
00:42:25,907 --> 00:42:28,076
每个人都在履行自己的职责。
Everyone carries out his duty.

607
00:42:28,159 --> 00:42:30,203
你说出了显而易见的事实，史波克。
You state the obvious, Spock.

608
00:42:30,328 --> 00:42:34,290
我的发言内容没有规定。
There is no regulation regarding the content of my statement.

609
00:42:34,582 --> 00:42:36,459
我可以继续吗？
May I continue?

610
00:42:36,793 --> 00:42:39,921
很好。你的 20 分钟快到了。
Very well. Your 20 minutes is almost up.

611
00:42:40,088 --> 00:42:42,966
契科夫先生，那艘船上只有一个瓦肯人，
Mr. Chekov, there is only one Vulcan aboard that ship,

612
00:42:43,049 --> 00:42:44,801
他应该很容易找到。
he should be easy enough to locate.

613
00:42:44,884 --> 00:42:48,054
契科夫：罗慕伦人和瓦肯人读起来几乎一模一样。
CHEKOV: Romulans and Vulcans appear to read almost exactly alike.

614
00:42:48,137 --> 00:42:50,473
只是有一点点不同--
There is just a slight difference which--

615
00:42:51,975 --> 00:42:53,476
找到他了，先生。
Got him, sir.

616
00:42:53,768 --> 00:42:56,020
尽快把坐标发给传送室。
Feed the coordinates to the transporter room on the double.

617
00:42:56,145 --> 00:42:58,439
让他们准备听我的信号将他传送到船上。
Have them prepare to beam him aboard on my signal.

618
00:42:58,523 --> 00:43:01,985
柯克舰长，斯科特先生在线上与您通话，长官。
Captain Kirk, Mr. Scott is on the intercom for you, sir.

619
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:03,653
说吧，斯科提。
Go ahead, Scotty.

620
00:43:03,987 --> 00:43:05,738
我已经安装了设备。
I've got the device installed.

621
00:43:05,863 --> 00:43:08,157
但如果我知道它是否能运作，保佑我
But bless me if I know if it's going to work.

622
00:43:08,241 --> 00:43:09,993
<i>这是我打过最大的赌</i>
<i>It's the biggest guess I've ever made.</i>

623
00:43:10,076 --> 00:43:11,619
- 准备，斯科提。 - 契科夫：长官。
- Stand by, Scotty. - CHEKOV: Sir.

624
00:43:11,703 --> 00:43:15,123
传送室有坐标，可以传送了。
Transporter room has the coordinates and is ready for beaming.

625
00:43:16,165 --> 00:43:19,252
传送室，传送史波克先生上船。
Transporter room, beam Mr. Spock aboard.

626
00:43:19,377 --> 00:43:22,755
除了瓦肯人忠诚的历史传统外，
Beyond the historic tradition of Vulcan loyalty

627
00:43:22,922 --> 00:43:25,466
还有罗慕兰人和瓦肯人联合起来的
there is also the combined Romulan-Vulcan history

628
00:43:25,591 --> 00:43:27,719
服从职责的历史。
of obedience to duty.

629
00:43:29,595 --> 00:43:31,848
传送室报告史波克先生上船了，指挥官。
Transporter room reports Mr. Spock aboard, sir.

630
00:43:31,973 --> 00:43:33,558
还有罗慕伦指挥官。
And the Romulan commander.

631
00:43:33,725 --> 00:43:35,101
- 指挥官？ - 是的，先生。
- The commander? - Aye, sir.

632
00:43:35,226 --> 00:43:36,519
好的。
All right.

633
00:43:36,644 --> 00:43:38,980
让他们尽快到舰桥报告。
Have them report to the bridge on the double.

634
00:43:39,856 --> 00:43:42,025
苏鲁先生，带我们离开罗慕伦人的地方。
Mr. Sulu, take us away from the Romulans.

635
00:43:42,316 --> 00:43:44,485
曲速9。
Warp factor 9.

636
00:43:50,992 --> 00:43:54,495
副指挥官。敌舰正以极快的速度驶离，长官。
Sub-Commander. The enemy vessel is moving away at extreme speed, sir.

637
00:43:54,662 --> 00:43:57,165
通知所有船只。武器官，
Alert all vessels. Weapons officer,

638
00:43:57,248 --> 00:43:59,917
将主炮台对准企业号。
bring main batteries to bear on the <i>Enterprise</i>.

639
00:44:03,212 --> 00:44:05,339
保持在曲速 9，长官。
Holding at warp 9, sir.

640
00:44:06,424 --> 00:44:08,634
斯科提，打开那个设备的开关。
Scotty, throw the switch on that device.

641
00:44:10,053 --> 00:44:12,263
试过了，长官。它不管用。
I did, sir. It's not working.

642
00:44:17,143 --> 00:44:20,605
我本会称赞你能走到这一步，舰长。
I would give you credit, captain, for getting this far.

643
00:44:21,105 --> 00:44:23,024
但你马上就要死了
But you will be dead in a moment

644
00:44:23,316 --> 00:44:24,984
称赞是不必要的。
and the credit would be gratuitous.

645
00:44:25,109 --> 00:44:27,445
上尉，打开通往罗慕伦飞船的频道。。
Lieutenant, open a channel to the Romulan vessel.

646
00:44:27,528 --> 00:44:28,863
乌乎拉：是的，长官。
UHURA: Aye, sir.

647
00:44:31,783 --> 00:44:33,576
我接通了副指挥官塔尔，长官。
I have Sub-Commander Tal, sir.

648
00:44:33,659 --> 00:44:35,912
建立双向可视通讯。
Establish two-way visual contact.

649
00:44:43,086 --> 00:44:45,797
<i>我们有你在我们的武器下。你无法逃脱。</i>
<i>We have you under our weapons. You cannot escape.</i>

650
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:47,548
这是柯克舰长。停火。
This is Captain Kirk. Hold your fire.

651
00:44:47,673 --> 00:44:50,551
- 我们有你的指挥官在船上。 - <i>指挥官。</i>
- We have your Commander aboard. - <i>Commander.</i>

652
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:54,847
摧毁这艘船。我给你下了直接命令，塔尔。
Destroy this vessel. I gave you a direct command, Tal.

653
00:44:56,390 --> 00:44:59,268
舵手，侧翼速度。武器官，
Helmsman, flank speed. Weapons officer,

654
00:44:59,352 --> 00:45:03,272
准备发射主炮，一旦我们达到最佳射击距离。
stand by to fire main batteries as soon as we reach optimum range.

655
00:45:04,482 --> 00:45:08,486
- 斯科提，我们的时间不多了。 - 舰长，我正在尽可能快地工作。
- Scotty, we're running out of time. - Captain, I'm working as fast as I can.

656
00:45:08,653 --> 00:45:11,781
你看，舰长，你的努力白费了。
You see, captain, your effort has been wasted.

657
00:45:13,950 --> 00:45:16,869
史波克先生，离罗慕伦飞船的距离？
Mr. Spock, distance from the Romulan vessel?

658
00:45:16,953 --> 00:45:20,748
十五万公里，舰长，接近地非常快。
One hundred fifty thousand kilometers, captain, and closing very rapidly.

659
00:45:21,207 --> 00:45:23,334
准备，相位炮。
Stand by, phasers.

660
00:45:24,669 --> 00:45:26,963
指挥官，请原谅我的反抗。
Commander, you'll forgive me if I put up a fight.

661
00:45:27,964 --> 00:45:30,466
当然，这是意料之中的。
Of course, it's expected.

662
00:45:30,550 --> 00:45:33,803
十万公里。他们应该开始向我们开火
One-hundred thousand kilometers. They should commence firing at us

663
00:45:33,886 --> 00:45:37,640
在接下来的 12.7 秒内。
within the next 12.7 seconds.

664
00:45:38,099 --> 00:45:40,393
- 斯科提。 - 现在准备好了，舰长，
- Scotty. - It's ready now, captain,

665
00:45:40,476 --> 00:45:43,688
但我不知道我们的电路是否可以应付这个外星装置。
but I don't know whether our circuits can handle this alien contraption.

666
00:45:48,109 --> 00:45:50,695
- 打开开关。 - 它可能会超载。
- Throw the switch. - It'll likely overload.

667
00:45:50,820 --> 00:45:52,697
打开开关。
Throw the switch.

668
00:45:56,784 --> 00:45:59,162
武器官，开始--
Weapons officer, commence fi--

669
00:46:02,874 --> 00:46:05,710
消失了。他们有隐形装置。
Gone. They have the cloaking device.

670
00:46:05,835 --> 00:46:09,255
快。根据最后的位置计算敌人的路线并开火。
Quickly. Compute enemy course from last position and open fire.

671
00:46:09,338 --> 00:46:13,092
- 是的，长官。 - 苏鲁，转向 318 标记 7。
- Yes, sir. - Sulu, come about 318 mark 7.

672
00:46:13,176 --> 00:46:17,346
318标记 7，长官。执行中。
Three-one-eight mark 7, sir. Executing.

673
00:46:29,984 --> 00:46:31,986
隐形装置工作正常。
The cloaking device is working perfectly.

674
00:46:32,069 --> 00:46:33,654
指挥官告诉我
And the commander has informed me

675
00:46:33,738 --> 00:46:37,742
即使是罗慕伦人的传感器也无法跟踪如此装备的船只。
that even the Romulans' sensors cannot track a vessel so equipped.

676
00:46:39,368 --> 00:46:41,579
谢谢你，史波克先生。
Thank you, Mr. Spock.

677
00:46:45,499 --> 00:46:47,376
取消红色警报。
Cancel red alert.

678
00:46:47,835 --> 00:46:51,047
我们会让你在最近的联邦前哨站下船。
We'll let you off at the nearest Federation outpost.

679
00:46:51,672 --> 00:46:53,883
你很慷慨，舰长。
You are very generous, captain.

680
00:46:54,717 --> 00:46:56,886
如果我可以被带到你的禁闭室，
If I may be taken to your brig,

681
00:46:57,094 --> 00:46:59,639
我将作为你的俘虏。
I will take my place as your prisoner.

682
00:46:59,764 --> 00:47:02,934
史波克先生将有幸护送你到你的住所。
Mr. Spock will have the honor of escorting you to your quarters.

683
00:47:07,855 --> 00:47:09,523
舰长。
Captain.

684
00:47:10,316 --> 00:47:11,817
指挥官。
Commander.

685
00:47:23,287 --> 00:47:24,747
2号甲板。
Deck 2.

686
00:47:27,583 --> 00:47:32,046
很遗憾你成为了一个不情愿的乘客。
It is regrettable that you were made an unwilling passenger.

687
00:47:32,338 --> 00:47:34,215
这不是故意的。
It was not intentional.

688
00:47:34,548 --> 00:47:37,718
联邦想要的只是隐形装置。
All the Federation wanted was the cloaking device.

689
00:47:38,719 --> 00:47:40,346
联邦？
The Federation?

690
00:47:41,806 --> 00:47:43,641
你想要什么？
And what did you want?

691
00:47:45,977 --> 00:47:50,106
当我登上你的船时，那是我唯一的关注点。
It was my only interest when I boarded your vessel.

692
00:47:50,481 --> 00:47:53,192
这就是你离开的全部原因。
And that's exactly all you came away with.

693
00:47:56,279 --> 00:47:59,073
你低估了自己，指挥官。
You underestimate yourself, commander.

694
00:48:01,117 --> 00:48:02,493
你会意识到很快
You realize that very soon

695
00:48:02,576 --> 00:48:05,663
我们就会破解你偷来的隐形装置。
we will learn to penetrate the cloaking device you stole.

696
00:48:05,746 --> 00:48:07,373
很明显。
Obviously.

697
00:48:08,249 --> 00:48:11,252
军事机密是最短暂的。
Military secrets are the most fleeting of all.

698
00:48:13,045 --> 00:48:19,176
我希望你我交换的东西更永久。
I hope that you and I exchanged something more permanent.

699
00:48:25,099 --> 00:48:26,726
[开门]
[DOORS OPEN]

700
00:48:35,693 --> 00:48:37,611
这是你的选择。
It was your choice.

701
00:48:38,863 --> 00:48:41,407
这是唯一可能的选择。
It was the only choice possible.

702
00:48:41,907 --> 00:48:44,660
你不会尊重任何其他人。
You would not respect any other.

703
00:48:45,786 --> 00:48:47,747
这将是我们的秘密。
It will be our secret.

704
00:48:51,792 --> 00:48:54,211
进入中立区，舰长。
Entering neutral zone, captain.

705
00:48:54,295 --> 00:48:57,006
很好，契科夫先生。谢谢你，莱斯利先生。
Very good, Mr. Chekov. Thank you, Mr. Leslie.

706
00:48:57,118 --> 00:48:58,643
麦考伊 [通过对讲机]：<i>医务室呼叫舰桥。</i>
McCOY [OVER INTERCOM]: <i>Sickbay to bridge.</i>

707
00:48:58,716 --> 00:48:59,925
怎么了，老骨头？
What is it, Bones?

708
00:49:00,076 --> 00:49:01,870
如果所有的争吵都结束了,
If all the shouting's over up there,

709
00:49:01,965 --> 00:49:04,009
我想让你到医务室报告。
I'd like for you to report to Sickbay.

710
00:49:04,263 --> 00:49:06,557
- 做什么的？ - <i>你该做手术了。</i>
- What for? - <i>Well, you're due in surgery.</i>

711
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:08,559
<i>我要恢复你的耳朵。</i>
<i>I'm going to bob your ears.</i>

712
00:49:09,060 --> 00:49:11,854
舰长，请你离开。
Captain, please go.

713
00:49:12,104 --> 00:49:16,025
不知何故，它们在人类身上看起来并不美观。
Somehow, they do not look aesthetically agreeable on humans.

714
00:49:17,777 --> 00:49:20,321
嗯，你来了吗，吉姆？还是你想一辈子
