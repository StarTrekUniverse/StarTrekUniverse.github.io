<i>Mr. Spock is unable to account for this as he reported no life on the planet.</i>

4
00:00:19,791 --> 00:00:25,421

MAN: Are you from the spaceship <i>Enterprise</i>?

6
00:00:32,303 --> 00:00:34,389
是的
That's right.

7
00:00:40,812 --> 00:00:42,939
亚历山大，竭诚为您服务
Alexander, at your service.

8
00:00:43,106 --> 00:00:45,984
我会唱歌，跳舞，玩各种游戏
I sing, dance, play a variety of games.

9
00:00:46,151 --> 00:00:50,488
我是一个非常经得起输的人，请记住这一点
And I'm a very good loser. Please try to bear that in mind.

10
00:00:50,697 --> 00:00:53,992
但现在，请你陪我好吗？
But now, would you please accompany me?

11
00:00:54,993 --> 00:00:56,828
谁是这个星球的居民？
Who are the inhabitants of this planet?

12
00:00:56,995 --> 00:00:58,913
柏拉图人
Platonians.

13
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:01,958
我们的母星恒星是桑达纳
Our native star is Sahndara.

14
00:01:02,125 --> 00:01:04,627
在它变成新星之前，我们逃脱了
Just before it went nova, we escaped.

15
00:01:04,794 --> 00:01:08,173
我们的领袖喜欢柏拉图的思想

16
00:01:08,339 --> 00:01:12,760
我们的哲人王帕门称我们为柏拉图的孩子
Our philosopher-king, Parmen, calls us Plato's Children,

17
00:01:12,927 --> 00:01:17,849
尽管我们认为我们更像是柏拉图的继子
although we think of ourselves more as Plato's stepchildren.

18
00:01:18,016 --> 00:01:21,227
对不起，有人在等你
Excuse me, someone's waiting for you.

19
00:01:29,944 --> 00:01:34,199
- 欢迎，谁是医生？  - 我是，有什么问题？
- Welcome. Who is the physician? - I am. What's the problem?

20
00:01:34,365 --> 00:01:37,785
我的配偶，他的腿，到这来
My spouse, his leg. Come this way.

21
00:01:44,542 --> 00:01:47,045
那条腿怎么了？
What happened to that leg?

22
00:01:47,212 --> 00:01:53,384
- 我想我划破了它  - 应该立即处理
- I suppose I scratched it. - It should've been attended to at once.

23
00:01:53,551 --> 00:01:57,555
纯粹的无知，你有什么可以做的吗？
Sheer ignorance. Is there anything you can do?

24
00:01:58,389 --> 00:02:02,227
我们一定会尝试，感染非常严重
We'll certainly try. The infection is massive.

25
00:02:02,393 --> 00:02:05,897
让我给你打一针来缓解疼痛
Let me give you a hypo to ease the pain.

26
00:02:10,193 --> 00:02:12,737
- 哪里？  - 在手臂上

27
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:29,295
菲拉娜，他们是来帮忙的，他们不该死
Philana, they came to help. They deserve better than to die.

28
00:02:30,588 --> 00:02:33,299

- 怎么样？你的预后是什么？  - 当我有结果时我会告诉你
- What is it? What is your prognosis? - I'll tell you when I have the results.

41
00:04:26,579 --> 00:04:31,834
从现在，不用你帮忙，我自己操纵仪器比较好
From now on, it's better if I handle the instruments without your help.

42
00:04:36,297 --> 00:04:39,717
我不明白为什么伤口变得如此严重
I can't understand why a cut became so serious.

43
00:04:39,884 --> 00:04:41,302

00:04:41,469 --> 00:04:47,100
我如何在没有关于柏拉图星细菌的信息的情况下消除感染？
How do I knock out an infection with no information on Platonius bacteria?

45
00:04:47,266 --> 00:04:52,730
我所能做的就是尝试将他的细菌与已知的菌株相匹配，并祈祷
All I can do is try to match his bugs with a known strain, and hope.

46
00:04:57,151 --> 00:05:00,363
- 你的潘神处于危险之中  - 嗯嗯…

- 当你睡着时它们会停止吗？  - 如果嵌入无意识，则不会

54
00:05:28,224 --> 00:05:30,935
医学呢？没有医生？
What about medicine? No doctors?

55
00:05:31,102 --> 00:05:34,605
我们对医学技能没有迫切的需求
We've had no pressing need for the medical arts.

56
00:05:34,772 --> 00:05:39,735
还在桑达纳星时，我们开始了大规模优生计划
While still on Sahndara, we began a mass eugenics program.

57
00:05:39,902 --> 00:05:41,988
我们就是成果
We're the result.

58
00:05:42,155 --> 00:05:46,075
减少到38人，我们非常适合我们的乌托邦
Pared down to 38, we're perfect for our utopia.

59
00:05:46,242 --> 00:05:50,788
我们是为沉思和自力更生而生的
We're bred for contemplation, and self-reliance.

60
00:05:50,955 --> 00:05:54,208
而且长寿，你说我几岁？
And longevity. How old would you say I am?

61
00:05:55,126 --> 00:05:57,211
不要害怕，我不虚荣
Don't be afraid. I'm not vain.

62
00:05:57,378 --> 00:06:00,506
- 35  - 这么老？
- Thirty-five. - That old?

63
00:06:03,176 --> 00:06:09,390
我在30岁停止衰老，无论如何，你差了2000年年
I stopped aging at 30. Anyway, you're off by 2,000 years.

64
00:06:10,475 --> 00:06:14,020
我今年2300岁
I'm 2,300 years old.

65
00:06:15,521 --> 00:06:18,816
我们很年轻就结婚了，我当时只有117岁
We were married very young. I was only 117.

66
00:06:18,983 --> 00:06:21,652
他128岁
And he was 128.

67
00:06:22,737 --> 00:06:25,948
所以我们几乎不必再搬家了，更不用说工作了
So we scarcely have to move anymore, let alone work.

68
00:06:26,115 --> 00:06:28,993
- 所以你没有抵抗力？  - 是的
- So you have no resistance? - That's right.

69
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:32,330
皮肤破裂或割伤可能是致命的
A break in the skin or a cut can be fatal.

70
00:06:34,499 --> 00:06:36,542
[呜咽]
[WHIMPERS]

71
00:06:50,139 --> 00:06:52,141
真有趣
Fascinating.

72
00:06:52,308 --> 00:06:58,189
我们正在体验他神志失常的意念运动表现
We're experiencing the psychokinetic manifestations of his delirium.

73
00:07:04,237 --> 00:07:06,656
斯科特呼叫柯克舰长
Scott to Captain Kirk.

74
00:07:06,906 --> 00:07:11,535
- 柯克呼叫<i>企业号</i>  - 我们正处于风暴之中
- Kirk to <i>Enterprise</i>. - We're in the midst of a storm.

75
00:07:11,702 --> 00:07:15,206
<i>没有明显的原因，我从未见过类似的东西</i>
<i>No discernible cause. I've never seen anything like it.</i>

76
00:07:15,373 --> 00:07:17,708
有10级湍流
There's 10-scale turbulence.

77
00:07:17,875 --> 00:07:21,671
紧急陀螺仪和稳定器开到了最大
Emergency gyros and stabilizers at maximum.

78
00:07:21,837 --> 00:07:24,632
<i>如果一直这样，我们就撑不下去了</i>
<i>If this keeps up, we can't last.</i>

79
00:07:24,799 --> 00:07:27,843
引擎全速运转，让她脱离轨道
Engines at full speed. Get her out of orbit.

80
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:31,722
我试过了，先生，她被锁得很紧
I've tried that, sir. She's locked tight.

81
00:07:31,889 --> 00:07:35,393
- 那就准备好迎接风暴吧  - 好的，舰长
- Then batten down and weather. - Right, Captain.

82
00:07:37,061 --> 00:07:39,814
帕门的想法不是…小心！
Parmen's mind is not... Watch it!

83
00:07:39,981 --> 00:07:44,902
他也在撕毁<i>企业号</i>，老骨头，把他打倒
He's tearing up the <i>Enterprise</i> as well. Bones, knock him out.

84
00:08:00,292 --> 00:08:02,962
救命！救救我！
Help! Save me!

85
00:08:07,508 --> 00:08:09,301
亚历山大，哦！
Alexander. Oooh!

86
00:08:10,553 --> 00:08:14,473
- 站在我身后  - 他的头脑无论如何都会找到我的
- Stand behind me. - His mind will find me anyhow.

87
00:08:16,392 --> 00:08:18,811
不要救他，让他死
Don't save him. Let him die.

88
00:08:18,978 --> 00:08:22,606
他们会为了取代他的位置而互相残杀
They'll kill each other trying to take his place.

89
00:08:22,773 --> 00:08:25,985
- 快点开枪  - 就是现在，医生！
- Hurry up with that shot. - Now, Doctor!

90
00:08:30,197 --> 00:08:34,035
我无法呼吸！我窒息了！
I can't breathe! I'm choking!

91
00:08:36,871 --> 00:08:40,332
老骨头！摇晃他，分散他的注意力
Bones! Shake him, break his concentration.

92
00:08:58,017 --> 00:09:00,102
柯克呼叫<i>企业号</i>
Kirk to <i>Enterprise</i>.

93
00:09:00,269 --> 00:09:02,855
湍流已经减弱
The turbulence has abated.

94
00:09:03,022 --> 00:09:06,275
你会发现轨道锁也坏了
You'll find the orbit lock is broken as well.

95
00:09:06,442 --> 00:09:10,112
评估损坏并进行必要的修理
Assess damage and repair whatever is necessary.

96
00:09:10,279 --> 00:09:14,116
我不知道如何感谢你，为柏拉图星和我自己
I don't know how to thank you, for Platonius and for myself.

97
00:09:14,283 --> 00:09:18,329
- 不需要感谢  - 带我们的客人到南翼
- No thanks is necessary. - Show our guests to the south wing.

98
00:09:18,496 --> 00:09:21,290
谢谢你，我们必须回到船上
Thank you, we must return to the ship.

99
00:09:21,457 --> 00:09:24,335
我最好等到退烧了
I'd better wait until the fever breaks.

100
00:09:24,502 --> 00:09:25,920
好…
Well...

101
00:09:26,087 --> 00:09:28,172
以防万一，我们会留下来
In that case, we'll stay.

102
00:09:37,723 --> 00:09:41,185
- 你想要什么，尽管说  - 谢谢
- Anything you want, just ask me. - Thank you.

103
00:09:41,352 --> 00:09:46,107
不用谢，你救了我的命，我应该告诉你…
Think nothing of it, you saved my life. I should tell you that...

104
00:09:46,273 --> 00:09:48,943
- 告诉我什么？  - 好…
- Tell me what? - Well...

105
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:53,489
- 我从来不知道像你这样的人存在  - 大家在哪里？
- I never knew people like you existed. - Where is everyone?

106
00:09:53,656 --> 00:09:56,450
他们都在房间里，冥想
They're all in chambers, meditating.

107
00:09:56,617 --> 00:09:58,327
亚历山大…
Alexander...

108
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:03,541
还有像你一样的柏拉图人吗？
Are there other Platonians like you?

109
00:10:03,707 --> 00:10:08,963
- “像我一样”是什么意思？  - 没有意念运动能力的人
- What do you mean "like me"? - Who don't have psychokinetic ability.

110
00:10:09,964 --> 00:10:13,300
我以为你在说我的体型
I thought you were talking about my size.

111
00:10:13,467 --> 00:10:16,345
他们取笑我的体型
They make fun of me for my size.

112
00:10:16,512 --> 00:10:19,974
但我是唯一没有念力的人
But I'm the only one who doesn't have it.

113
00:10:20,141 --> 00:10:22,017
我是宫廷小丑
I'm the court buffoon.

114
00:10:22,184 --> 00:10:27,231
我是所有人的奴隶，我永远都是错的
I'm everybody's slave and I never do anything right.

115
00:10:27,398 --> 00:10:33,863
- 如何获得能力？  - 它是生来就有的
- How does one obtain the power? - It just comes to you after you're born.

116
00:10:34,029 --> 00:10:38,284
他们说我是一个返祖者，我是，你也是
They say I'm a throwback. And I am, and so are you.

117
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:43,664
- 对不起，我不应该那样说  - 别担心，我们很高兴没有它
- Sorry, I shouldn't have said that. - Don't worry. We're happy without it.

118
00:10:47,293 --> 00:10:50,379
你知道，我相信你是
You know, I believe you are.

119
00:10:50,546 --> 00:10:54,592
在你的故乡，有人多没有念力
Where you come from, are there a lot of people without the power

120
00:10:54,758 --> 00:10:56,552
和我一样体型的人吗？
and my size?

121
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:05,060
亚历山大，在我的故乡，高矮，胖瘦，或肤色没有区别
Alexander, where I come from, size, shape or colour makes no difference.

122
00:11:05,227 --> 00:11:08,606
没有人有念力
And nobody has the power.

123
00:11:08,772 --> 00:11:10,774
没有人？
Nobody?

124
00:11:12,693 --> 00:11:15,529
有人叫我
Somebody wants me.

125
00:11:15,696 --> 00:11:19,617
舰长，离开这里会很高兴的
Captain, it will be very gratifying to leave here.

126
00:11:19,783 --> 00:11:22,494
那可能并不容易，如果帕门死了
That might not be easy, should Parmen die.

127
00:11:22,661 --> 00:11:25,539
- 即使他不死也很难  - 是的
- Even if he shouldn't. - Yes.

128
00:11:25,706 --> 00:11:30,211
这个乌托邦是银河系中保存最完好的秘密之一
This utopia is one of the best-kept secrets in the galaxy.

129
00:11:30,377 --> 00:11:35,341
屏蔽我们的传感器，将我们锁定在轨道上
Screening themselves from our sensors, locking us into orbit.

130
00:11:35,507 --> 00:11:37,551
所有这些加起来就是一个模式
All this adds up to a pattern.

131
00:11:37,843 --> 00:11:41,513
吉姆，我的药方奏效了，退烧了
Jim, my concoction worked, the fever's broken.

132
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:45,267
感染已经开始消退
And the infection's begun to drain already.

133
00:11:45,434 --> 00:11:51,982
- 你也许还能治好普通感冒  - 如果要走，就是现在
- You may yet cure the common cold. - If there's a time to go, it's now.

134
00:11:53,984 --> 00:11:55,986
- 我是斯科特  - 柯克[通过无线电]：<i>传送我们上去</i>
- Scott, here. - KIRK [OVER RADIO]: <i>Beam us up.</i>

135
00:11:56,153 --> 00:12:01,367
- 我不能，一切都冻结了  - 湍流的伤害这么大吗？

- 船的损伤很小  - <i>那是什么引起的？</i>
- Damage to the ship is minimal. - <i>What caused it?</i>

137
00:12:05,955 --> 00:12:09,458
我不知道，先生，但事实如此
I don't know, sir. And those are the facts.

138
00:12:09,625 --> 00:12:14,046
- 你进入太空了吗？  - <i>轨道的引力比以往更大</i>
- Did you get up into space? - <i>The orbit's locked tighter than ever.</i>

139
00:12:14,213 --> 00:12:18,968

And subspace communication with Starfleet is completely severed.

00:13:02,052 --> 00:13:06,557
我想知道为什么船上的仪器被冻结了
I would like to know why the ship's instrumentation is frozen.

150
00:13:06,724 --> 00:13:12,313
- 为什么<i>企业号</i>被锁定在轨道上  - 舰长，请，你误会了
- Why the <i>Enterprise</i> is locked in orbit. - Captain, please. You are mistaken.

151
00:13:12,479 --> 00:13:15,733
我已经和船上的轮机长谈过了
I've talked to the engineer aboard the ship.

152

我们已经表明了我们的诚意，现在你展示你的

- 我要立即释放这艘船  - 设施

客人不会闯入这里提出要求，发布命令

158
00:14:19,713 --> 00:14:22,383
柯克呼叫<i>企业号</i>，请回答

159
00:14:22,549 --> 00:14:26,178
<i>企业号</i>，请回答…我无法联系他们

160
00:14:26,345 --> 00:14:29,848
帕门不想我们与<i>企业号</i>联系
Parmen does not want contact made with the <i>Enterprise</i>.

161
00:14:30,015 --> 00:14:33,769
他可能需要我们的医疗补给，为什么要禁止联系？
He may need our medical stores. Why prevent contact?

162
00:14:33,936 --> 00:14:39,483
为了不让外界知道他是如何对待一位星际舰队舰长的
To shut out any knowledge of his treatment of a Starfleet captain.

163
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:43,404

166
00:14:54,498 --> 00:14:56,208
你要去哪里？
Where are you going?

167
00:14:56,375 --> 00:15:01,088
我不知道，我不想去，但我控制不住自己

168
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:09,179
[吹号角]
[PLAYS FANFARE]

169
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:30,451
善良的太空人，我们永远欠你的人情

170
00:15:30,617 --> 00:15:34,413
请收下这些东西作为谢礼
Please accept these trifles as tokens of gratitude,

171
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:37,124
来自我们灵感的源头
from the source of our inspiration.

172
00:15:37,291 --> 00:15:39,209
赠予我们的舰长
To our captain,

173
00:15:39,376 --> 00:15:44,256
伯里克利举过的盾牌，象征英勇的领导

174
00:15:48,969 --> 00:15:52,264
赠予我们沉默而理智的史波克先生
To our silent and cerebral Mr. Spock,

175
00:15:52,431 --> 00:15:56,685
这把西塞拉琴，它弹拨的乐曲能抚平他紧锁的眉头
this kithara to pluck music to soothe his ever-active brow.

176
00:16:00,898 --> 00:16:05,652
最后，赠予拯救了柏拉图星和我配偶的麦考伊医生
And lastly, to Dr. McCoy who saved Platonius and my spouse,

177
00:16:05,819 --> 00:16:11,158
这本古老的希腊疗法集，由希波克拉底本人撰写
this ancient collection of Greek cures, penned by Hippocrates himself.

178
00:16:18,248 --> 00:16:19,833
<i>企业号</i>被释放了吗？
Has the <i>Enterprise</i> been released yet?

179
00:16:20,459 --> 00:16:22,336
舰长，等等
Captain, wait.

180
00:16:22,503 --> 00:16:28,091
我知道你在想什么，我很抱歉，对你的态度很恶劣
I know what you're thinking. My apologies, you were badly used.

181
00:16:28,258 --> 00:16:34,389
我要为自己辩护，我的病比我意识到的更令人不安
In my own defence, my illness was more disturbing than I realised.

182
00:16:34,556 --> 00:16:37,935
我相信你也有过失态的时候
I'm sure you, too, have been out of sorts

183
00:16:38,101 --> 00:16:41,355
也有过被迫发脾气和发怒的时候
and driven to fits of temper and rage.

184
00:16:41,522 --> 00:16:45,567
但与你不同的是，我的想法和感受，无论好坏
But unlike you, what I think and feel, for good or ill,

185
00:16:45,734 --> 00:16:51,156
瞬间转化为现实，在你的心中找到原谅我的理由吧
is instantly translated into reality. Find it in your heart to forgive me.

186
00:16:51,323 --> 00:16:53,158
当然
Certainly.

187
00:16:53,325 --> 00:16:55,077
<i>企业号</i>被释放了吗？
Has the <i>Enterprise</i> been released yet?

188
00:16:55,327 --> 00:16:58,205
很快就会了
It will be shortly.

189
00:16:58,372 --> 00:17:01,792
- 那么日安，谢谢你  - 不用谢
- Then good day, and thank you. - Not at all.

190
00:17:01,959 --> 00:17:05,921
最后还有一个要求
There is one final request.

191
00:17:06,129 --> 00:17:10,467
在我几乎致命的感染之后，它变得很明显
After my nearly fatal infection, it has become obvious

192
00:17:10,634 --> 00:17:14,304
我们不能没有医生
that we cannot afford to be without a physician.

193
00:17:14,471 --> 00:17:17,849
我们希望你留下来，麦考伊医生
We should like you, Dr. McCoy, to remain.

194
00:17:18,016 --> 00:17:20,227
对不起，那是不可能的
I'm sorry, that's impossible.

195
00:17:20,394 --> 00:17:23,438
你的职责会格外轻松
Your duties will be extraordinarily light.

196
00:17:23,605 --> 00:17:29,152
你可以自由地阅读，冥想，进行研究，随你喜欢
You shall be free to read, meditate, conduct research, whatever you like.

197
00:17:29,319 --> 00:17:31,029
答案是不
The answer is no.

198
00:17:31,363 --> 00:17:33,699
我们想保持亲切，但是…
We should like to keep it cordial, but...

199
00:17:33,865 --> 00:17:37,119
我们决心让你留下来，医生
we are determined to have you stay, Doctor.

200
00:17:40,163 --> 00:17:44,459
- 麦考伊医生救了你的命  - 我快失去耐心了
- Dr. McCoy saved your life. - I am losing patience.

201
00:17:44,668 --> 00:17:49,423
- 你是柏拉图的信徒？  - 我们生活在和平与和谐中
- You are a disciple of Plato? - We live in peace and harmony.

202
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:54,970
谁的和谐？你的？柏拉图想要真理和美
Whose harmony? Yours? Plato wanted truth and beauty.

203
00:17:55,137 --> 00:17:57,514
并且，最重要的是，正义
And, above all, justice.

204
00:17:57,681 --> 00:17:59,975
亲爱的史波克先生
My dear Mr. Spock,

205
00:18:00,142 --> 00:18:05,063
环境迫使我们对柏拉图进行一些改编
circumstances have forced us to make a few adaptations of Plato.

206
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:09,234
但我们的社会是可以想象的最民主的社会
But ours is the most democratic society conceivable.

207
00:18:09,401 --> 00:18:13,447
任何人都可以在任何时候成为或做任何他想做的事
Anyone can, at any moment, be or do anything he wishes,

208
00:18:13,614 --> 00:18:19,286
甚至成为柏拉图星的统治者，如果他的思想足够强大的话
even become ruler of Platonius, if his mind is strong enough.

209
00:18:19,453 --> 00:18:23,123
如果他的思想不强大，他会像亚历山大一样被撕裂？
If his mind isn't strong, he's torn apart like Alexander?

210
00:18:23,332 --> 00:18:25,125
我们不是孩子
We are not children.

211
00:18:25,334 --> 00:18:29,921
在你们的文化中，正义是强者的意志
In your culture, justice is the will of the stronger.

212
00:18:30,088 --> 00:18:34,092
它是通过武器，宇宙飞船强加给人们的
It is forced upon people by means of weapons, spaceships.

213
00:18:34,259 --> 00:18:40,432
我们的正义是更强大的思想的意志，是巨大的进步
Our justice is the will of the stronger mind, a vast improvement.

214
00:18:40,599 --> 00:18:44,394
我们不会使用武器来实施你这样的暴行
We don't use weapons for the brutality you practise.

215
00:18:44,561 --> 00:18:46,897
再见了，舰长
Farewell, Captain.

216
00:18:47,898 --> 00:18:49,733
走吧
Come on.

217
00:18:54,029 --> 00:18:55,739
麦考伊
McCoy.

218
00:18:55,906 --> 00:19:00,577
我不能动，无论如何他们都要把我留在这里
I can't move. They're gonna keep me here no matter what.

219
00:19:00,744 --> 00:19:03,914
- 请离开  - 不，你是医生
- Leave, please. - No, you're the doctor.

220
00:19:04,081 --> 00:19:07,542
他们不想强迫你，他们正在努力…
They don't want to force you. They're trying...

221
00:19:07,709 --> 00:19:10,170
趁你们还可以的时候赶紧走
Go while you still can.

222
00:19:13,674 --> 00:19:16,343
我们不走，除非放开他
We're not leaving till he's released.

223
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:19,346
你没有指挥权
You are not in command.

224
00:19:19,513 --> 00:19:24,184
- 为什么要争这个？赶他们走  - 那可能会冒犯医生
- Why discuss it? Get rid of them. - That might offend the doctor.

225
00:19:25,227 --> 00:19:28,188
你想留下来吗？无论如何
You wish to stay? By all means.

226
00:19:28,355 --> 00:19:30,691
帮助我们庆祝我们的周年纪念日
Help us celebrate our anniversary.

227
00:19:30,857 --> 00:19:35,153
我希望我们能说服你加入我们这个小小的理想国
I hope we can persuade you to join our tiny republic.

228
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:39,116
- 你不会说服我的  - 我想我们会的
- You won't persuade me. - I think we will.

00:27:12,277 --> 00:27:17,323
- 情绪健康，就是这样  - 那可能是，医生
- Emotionally healthy, that is. - That may be, Doctor.

274
00:27:17,490 --> 00:27:23,705
然而，我注意到情绪的健康释放
However, I have noted that the healthy release of emotion

275
00:27:23,872 --> 00:27:28,668
对你最亲近的人来说，通常是非常不健康的
is frequently very unhealthy for those closest to you.

276
00:27:31,838 --> 00:27:35,925
这证明没有完美的解决方案
Which goes to prove there's no perfect solution.

277
00:27:37,927 --> 00:27:40,180
看起来是这样
So it would seem.

278
00:27:42,599 --> 00:27:44,559
- 舰长  - 是的，史波克
- Captain. - Yes, Spock.

279
00:27:45,476 --> 00:27:49,522
你还对帕门感到愤怒吗？
Do you still feel anger toward Parmen?

280
00:27:51,524 --> 00:27:53,151
巨大的愤怒
Great anger.

281
00:27:53,318 --> 00:27:57,405
- 你呢，麦考伊医生？  - 是的，还有仇恨
- And you, Dr. McCoy? - Yes, and hatred.

282
00:27:58,448 --> 00:28:02,452
那么你必须释放它，先生们
Then you must release it, gentlemen,

283
00:28:02,619 --> 00:28:06,539
因为我必须控制我的
as I must master mine.

284
00:28:06,706 --> 00:28:10,877
我可能会严重伤害你，舰长
I might have seriously injured you, Captain,

285
00:28:11,044 --> 00:28:13,296
甚至杀了你
even killed you.

286
00:28:13,463 --> 00:28:18,843
他们在我心中激起了如此巨大的仇恨
They have evoked such great hatred in me,

287
00:28:20,053 --> 00:28:23,097
我不能让它更进一步
I cannot allow it to go further.

288
00:28:25,642 --> 00:28:27,769
我必须…
I must...

289
00:28:27,936 --> 00:28:29,812
…控制它
...master it.

290
00:28:31,231 --> 00:28:34,984
我必须…控制…
I must... control...

291
00:28:43,243 --> 00:28:44,702
吉姆…
Jim...

292
00:28:52,085 --> 00:28:55,213
这是毫无意义的，我会留下来
This is senseless. I'm staying.

293
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:58,466
- 你不能  - 帕门答应你会安全的
- You can't. - Parmen promised you'll be safe.

294
00:28:58,675 --> 00:29:03,554
他会传送上去，然后将船推回大气层
He'd let us beam up then plunge the ship back into the atmosphere.

295
00:29:03,721 --> 00:29:05,014
为什么要骗我？
Why trick me?

296
00:29:05,181 --> 00:29:09,143
因为如果他直接杀了我们，你会报复的
Because if he killed us outright, you'd retaliate.

297
00:29:09,310 --> 00:29:11,729
你是医生，你有办法
You're a doctor, you have the means.

298
00:29:11,896 --> 00:29:16,359
老骨头，我知道你正在努力做正确的事情
Bones, I know you're trying to do the right thing,

299
00:29:16,526 --> 00:29:18,653
但如果我们中的任何一个人逃脱了
but if any one of us escaped,

300
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:23,157
帕门知道星际舰队永远不会让这个星球逍遥法外
Parmen knows Starfleet would never let this planet go unpunished.

301
00:29:23,324 --> 00:29:27,328
你的牺牲就等于签署了我们的死刑令
Sacrifice yourself and you sign our death warrant.

302
00:29:27,495 --> 00:29:31,874
他是对的，我应该警告你的
He's right. I should have warned you.

303
00:29:32,041 --> 00:29:35,044
他们对待你们就像对待我一样
They were treating you the same way they treat me.

304
00:29:35,211 --> 00:29:37,547
只是你们与他们作斗争了
Only you fight them.

305
00:29:40,216 --> 00:29:45,096
一直以来，我都以为是我的问题，我的思维移动不了一块鹅卵石
All the time, I thought it was me, my mind couldn't move a pebble.

306
00:29:45,263 --> 00:29:50,685
他们甚至告诉我，留在他们身边是我的幸运，而我相信了他们
They even told me I was lucky they kept me around, and I believed them.

307
00:29:50,852 --> 00:29:53,730
被每个人心血来潮地呼来唤去
The arms and legs of everybody's whim.

308
00:29:53,896 --> 00:29:57,567
低眉顺目，不能直视他们，保持微笑
Look down, don't meet their eyes. Smile.

309
00:29:58,443 --> 00:30:02,280
这些强大的人，对我来说他们是神
These great people, they were gods to me.

310
00:30:02,447 --> 00:30:05,408
但你向我展示了他们的真实面目
But you showed me what they really are.

311
00:30:05,575 --> 00:30:11,581
现在我知道了，错的不是我，不是我的体型，而是他们
And now I know, it's not me, it's not my size, it's them.

312
00:30:13,082 --> 00:30:15,168
是他们！
It's them!

313
00:30:24,677 --> 00:30:27,805
- 放下它  - 不，这是最好的选择
- Put it down. - No, this is the best thing.

314
00:30:27,972 --> 00:30:30,391
- 照我说的做  - 我要杀了他们
- Do what I say. - I'm gonna cut them.

315
00:30:30,558 --> 00:30:36,397
首先是帕门，然后他们都会被感染，但这一次，让他们去死吧
Parmen first, and they'll all get infected. But this time, let them die.

316
00:30:36,564 --> 00:30:39,609
让他们尝尝他们给我的滋味
Let me give them a taste of what they gave me.

317
00:30:39,776 --> 00:30:42,278
反正他们会杀了你
They're gonna kill you, anyway.

318
00:30:42,445 --> 00:30:45,490
既然如此，你死了又有什么意义呢？
In that case, what's the point in you dying too?

319
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,202
把它给我
Give it to me.

320
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:02,965
这是第一次有人把我的生命置于他自己的生命之上
That's the first time anybody ever thought of my life before his own.

321
00:31:06,803 --> 00:31:12,809
我应该在你们刚来的时候告诉你们他们要杀了你们
I should have told you when you first came that they were gonna kill you.

322
00:31:12,975 --> 00:31:16,270
- 我当时很害怕  - 没关系
- I was afraid. - It's all right.

323
00:31:16,437 --> 00:31:18,940
没关系，亚历山大
It's all right, Alexander.

324
00:31:19,107 --> 00:31:21,818
我们还没有放弃
We haven't given up.

325
00:31:21,984 --> 00:31:25,154
也许你可以做些什么来提供帮助
And there may be something you can do to help.

326
00:31:27,115 --> 00:31:29,867
- 任何事，只要你说  - 好的
- Anything, you just tell me. - All right.

327
00:31:30,034 --> 00:31:33,830
柏拉图人一直都拥有这种力量吗？
Did the Platonians always have this power?

328
00:31:33,996 --> 00:31:37,542
- 不，我们来到这个星球后  - 亚历山大
- No, not until we came to this planet. - Alexander.

329
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:41,838
你能记得你们到达后多久
Is it possible for you to recall how long after you arrived

330
00:31:42,004 --> 00:31:45,341
他们的力量开始发展？
that their power began to develop?

331
00:31:45,508 --> 00:31:49,887
我们到达这里六个月后，他们开始到处推我
Six months after we got here, they started pushing me around.

332
00:31:50,054 --> 00:31:54,058
你们带了几个月的补给品？
How many months' supplies did you bring with you?

333
00:31:54,267 --> 00:31:58,146
- 四个月，我想…三个月  - 足够接近了
- Four, I think... Three. - That's close enough.

334
00:31:58,312 --> 00:32:03,860
真有趣，他们的力量是在吃过当地食物后发展起来的
Fascinating. Their power developed after eating the native foods.

335
00:32:05,153 --> 00:32:06,362
那就对了
That's right.

336
00:32:06,529 --> 00:32:11,534
有理由假设精神动力与
It's logical to assume a connection between the psychokinetic power

337
00:32:11,701 --> 00:32:13,536
食用本地食物之间存在联系
and eating native foods.

338
00:32:13,703 --> 00:32:17,206
为什么亚历山大没有同样的能力？
Why wouldn't Alexander have the same power?

339
00:32:17,373 --> 00:32:20,835
也许他无法吸收关键元素
Perhaps he cannot absorb the crucial element.

340
00:32:21,002 --> 00:32:24,172
老骨头，测一下亚历山大的血液
Bones, take a reading of Alexander's blood.

341
00:32:26,007 --> 00:32:29,719
不是我害怕，但这会痛吗？
Not that I'm afraid, but will it hurt much?

342
00:32:29,886 --> 00:32:31,762
你甚至不会知道它发生了
You won't even know it happened.

343
00:32:31,929 --> 00:32:35,057
你有帕门血液的读数
You have a reading of Parmen's blood.

344
00:32:35,224 --> 00:32:39,020
他有最强的意念运动能力
He has the highest psychokinetic ability

345
00:32:39,187 --> 00:32:42,398
在同等条件下，亚历山大最弱
and Alexander the lowest, in the same conditions.

346
00:32:42,565 --> 00:32:48,446
相较柏拉图人亚历山大可能有生化缺陷
Alexander probably has a biochemical deficiency relative to Platonius.

347
00:32:48,613 --> 00:32:52,742
我将运行两个样本进行比较测试
I'll run both samples through for a comparative test.

348
00:32:52,909 --> 00:32:56,412
如果我们的理论成立，我们就有了武器
If our theory works out, we've got a weapon.

349
00:32:58,873 --> 00:33:02,585
帕门和亚历山大血液的区别
The difference between Parmen's blood and Alexander's

350
00:33:02,752 --> 00:33:06,756
是被激素分解的基洛奈德的浓度
is the concentration of kironide broken down by hormone.

351
00:33:06,964 --> 00:33:11,093
基洛奈德，一种高能量的资源，可能就是这样
Kironide. A high-energy source. That could be it.

352
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:16,599
激素证实了这一假设，它们还调节身体生长
The hormones confirm the hypothesis. They also regulate body growth.

353
00:33:16,766 --> 00:33:18,768
你的意思是…
You mean...

354
00:33:18,935 --> 00:33:22,980
我没有力量和我成为侏儒是同一个原因？
The same thing that kept me from having the power made me a dwarf?

355
00:33:23,147 --> 00:33:27,944
是的，同样显而易见的是，巴门为什么要保守这个乌托邦的秘密
Yes. It's also obvious why Parmen kept this utopia secret.

356
00:33:28,152 --> 00:33:32,949
任何人在这里呆久了都会获得力量
Anyone remaining here long enough would acquire the power.

357
00:33:33,115 --> 00:33:34,867
正是
Exactly.

358
00:33:36,494 --> 00:33:40,623
一定有快速的方法在我们的血液中积累基洛奈德
There must be a quick way of building up kironide in our blood.

359
00:33:40,790 --> 00:33:44,210
- 这是可能的  - 我们还在等什么？
- It's possible. - What are we waiting for?

360
00:33:54,262 --> 00:33:55,680
它是什么？
What is it?

361
00:33:55,846 --> 00:34:00,685
即使基洛奈德有效果，也未必能帮我们脱身
Even if the kironide has an effect, it may not help us get out.

362
00:34:00,851 --> 00:34:04,021
- 是的，他们有38个人  - 有道理
- Yes, there are 38 of them. - Point taken.

363
00:34:04,188 --> 00:34:07,149
但这种力量是不能累加的
But the power is not additive.

364
00:34:07,316 --> 00:34:10,903
否则考虑到柏拉图人的倾向
If it were, considering the Platonians propensities,

365
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:15,783
两三个人会联合起来废黜帕门
two or three would have combined forces and deposed Parmen.

366
00:34:15,950 --> 00:34:17,493
他是对的
He's right.

367
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:21,163
帕门说每个人都有自己的力量频率
Parmen says each has his own power frequency.

368
00:34:21,330 --> 00:34:25,209
他们试过结合他们的力量，从未成功
When they tried to combine their powers, it never worked.

369
00:34:26,502 --> 00:34:29,338
- 我准备好了  - 我们不要浪费时间了
- I'm ready. - Let's not waste time.

370
00:34:29,505 --> 00:34:33,175
给我们双倍于帕门血液中的浓度
Give us double the concentration in Parmen's blood.

371
00:34:33,342 --> 00:34:35,386
时间因素让我很担心
The time factor concerns me.

372
00:34:35,553 --> 00:34:41,434
可能需要几天的时间才能有利好我们的足够的基洛奈德
It may take days before there's enough kironide to benefit us.

373
00:34:41,601 --> 00:34:43,227
是的
Yes.

374
00:34:44,437 --> 00:34:46,814
亚历山大呢？
What about Alexander?

375
00:34:46,981 --> 00:34:50,651
由于基洛奈德直接注入他的血液
Since the kironide's injected directly into his blood,

376
00:34:50,818 --> 00:34:54,405
应该对他更有效，因为他已经适应了
it should work on him better because he's acclimated.

377
00:34:54,572 --> 00:34:58,534
噢，不，不是在他们对我做了什么之后
Oh, no. Not after what they've done to me.

378
00:34:58,701 --> 00:35:03,205
为什么不？你可以取代帕门的位置并管理整个星球
Why not? You could take Parmen's place and run the whole planet.

379
00:35:04,248 --> 00:35:07,835
你认为那是我想要的吗？成为其中之一？
You think that's what I want? To become one of them?

380
00:35:08,002 --> 00:35:10,046
成为我自己的敌人？
Become my own enemy?

381
00:35:10,212 --> 00:35:13,841
躺着不动所有事情都由别人为我做好？
Lie around like a big blob and have things done for me?

382
00:35:14,008 --> 00:35:17,887
我想为自己走动，为自己笑或哭
I want to move around for myself, laugh or cry for myself.

383
00:35:18,054 --> 00:35:20,681
你可以保留你宝贵的力量
You can keep your precious power.

384
00:35:20,848 --> 00:35:25,603
我只要求一件事，如果你们能离开这里，带上我
All I ask is one thing. If you make it out of here, take me with you.

385
00:35:25,770 --> 00:35:30,191
把我带到没人听说过基洛奈德或柏拉图星的任何地方
Drop me any place they never heard of kironide or Platonius.

386
00:35:39,492 --> 00:35:41,452
柯克：护士…
KIRK: Nurse...

387
00:35:41,619 --> 00:35:43,579
乌胡拉上尉…
Lieutenant Uhura...

388
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:01,972
我想我们不够有趣
I guess we weren't sufficiently entertaining.

389
00:36:23,828 --> 00:36:25,663
我们很高兴见到你！
Are we glad to see you!

390
00:36:25,830 --> 00:36:27,790
我们被迫传送下来
We were forced to beam down.

391
00:36:27,957 --> 00:36:30,584
仿佛变成了某人的傀儡
It was like becoming someone's puppet.

392
00:36:30,751 --> 00:36:35,589
我以为我在梦游，我无法阻止自己
I thought I was sleepwalking. I couldn't stop myself.

393
00:36:35,756 --> 00:36:37,341
[笑声]
[LAUGHTER]

394
00:36:37,508 --> 00:36:41,387
舰长，怎么了？发生了什么？
Captain, what is it? What's going on?

395
00:36:43,764 --> 00:36:49,019
- 你觉得基洛奈德有什么效果吗？  - 我有一点燥热
- Do you feel any effect of the kironide? - I experienced a slight flush.

396
00:36:49,186 --> 00:36:51,731
我也是，让我们尝试一个简单的测试
So did I. Let's try a simple test.

397
00:36:51,897 --> 00:36:55,151
全神贯注提升这盘水果
Concentrate on raising this plate of fruit.

398
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:05,161
没有反应
Nothing.

399
00:37:05,327 --> 00:37:07,413
[掌声]
[APPLAUSE]

400
00:37:19,842 --> 00:37:23,512
各位学者，2500年前
Fellow academicians, 2,500 years ago,

401
00:37:23,679 --> 00:37:29,310
一群热情的流浪者来到了这个粗犷的星球
a band of hearty vagabonds arrived on this rough-hewn planet.

402
00:37:29,477 --> 00:37:32,521
穷困，辛劳
There was hardship, back-breaking toil,

403
00:37:32,688 --> 00:37:37,485
神圣的眷顾使我们的天才和奉献精神具有力量的力量
and then a divine providence graced our genius and dedication

404
00:37:37,651 --> 00:37:43,949
通过它，我们的每一个需求立即实现
with the power of powers, and through it our every need instantly materialised.

405
00:37:44,116 --> 00:37:48,621
我们于是决定成立一个乌托邦兄弟会
We thereupon determined to form a Utopian Brotherhood.

406
00:37:48,788 --> 00:37:53,459
这是一个喜庆的时刻，因为今晚我们欢迎它的第一个新成员
This is a festive occasion, for tonight we welcome into that brotherhood

407
00:37:53,626 --> 00:37:56,504
加入这个兄弟会
its first new member.

408
00:37:56,670 --> 00:38:00,966
还没有，帕门，你必须先说服医生
Not yet, Parmen. You have to convince the doctor first.

409
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:04,970
他们永远都做不到，吉姆
They'll never do it, Jim.

410
00:38:05,137 --> 00:38:10,142
医生，拜托，你破坏了女士们的节日气氛
Doctor, please, you have destroyed the festive mood of the ladies.

411
00:38:10,309 --> 00:38:12,853
我们必须立即活跃气氛

00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:14,814
我想到了
I know.

413
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:19,693
有什么比笑着的太空人唱小夜曲更好的呢？
What would be better than a serenade from the laughing spaceman?

[掌声]
[APPLAUSE]

430
00:40:32,409 --> 00:40:35,204
多么不忠和善变
How faithless and fickle.

431
00:40:35,371 --> 00:40:38,207
做个决定！
Make up your minds!

432
00:40:41,877 --> 00:40:46,048
我很难为情，请让他们停下来
I'm so ashamed. Please, make them stop.

433
00:40:46,215 --> 00:40:48,717
我们已经试过了
We have tried.

434
00:40:49,843 --> 00:40:53,430
拜托，请让他们停下来
Please, please make them stop.

435
00:41:01,438 --> 00:41:04,066
我没有那个能力
I haven't the power.

436
00:41:05,859 --> 00:41:08,988
我深感抱歉
I'm deeply sorry.

437
00:41:09,154 --> 00:41:11,865
我们辜负了你
We've failed you.

438
00:41:12,908 --> 00:41:16,078
这么久以来，我一直想靠近你
For so long, I've wanted to be close to you.

439
00:41:16,245 --> 00:41:19,915
现在我只想爬走然后死去
Now all I want to do is crawl away and die.

440
00:41:29,258 --> 00:41:33,095
小心，史波克先生，过多的爱是危险的
Careful, Mr. Spock, too much love is dangerous.

441
00:41:34,805 --> 00:41:38,809
请记住，丘比特的箭会杀死瓦肯人
Remember, Cupid's arrow kills Vulcans.

442
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:49,862
我好害怕，舰长，我非常害怕
I'm so frightened, Captain. I'm so very frightened.

443
00:41:50,029 --> 00:41:55,492
这就是他们希望你感受到的，这让他们觉得自己还活着
That's the way they want you to feel. It makes them think they're alive.

444
00:41:55,659 --> 00:41:58,120
我知道
I know it.

445
00:41:58,287 --> 00:42:02,499
但是…我希望我能停止颤抖
But... I wish I could stop trembling.

446
00:42:02,666 --> 00:42:05,711
尽量不要…去想它们
Try not... to think of them.

447
00:42:13,469 --> 00:42:15,220
试试！
Try!

448
00:42:20,225 --> 00:42:23,228
我在想…
I'm thinking...

449
00:42:23,437 --> 00:42:27,941
…想起了在<i>企业号</i>上每次吓到要死的时候
...of all the times on the <i>Enterprise</i> when I was scared to death.

450
00:42:30,444 --> 00:42:33,822
我看到你那么忙于指挥
And I would see you so busy at your commands,

451
00:42:34,823 --> 00:42:38,577
我能从船上的各个角落听到你的声音
and I would hear your voice from all parts of the ship,

452
00:42:39,536 --> 00:42:41,663
然后我的恐惧就会消退
and my fears would fade.

453
00:42:41,830 --> 00:42:45,000
现在你的声音让我颤抖
And now they're making me tremble.

454
00:42:46,043 --> 00:42:48,170
但我并不害怕
But I'm not afraid.

455
00:42:49,505 --> 00:42:52,382
我不害怕
I am not afraid.

456
00:43:03,352 --> 00:43:06,188
[笑声和掌声]
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]

457
00:43:10,484 --> 00:43:13,445
帕门，让我们继续吧
Parmen, let's get on with it.

458
00:43:13,612 --> 00:43:17,699
你太没耐心了，观察医生，学习
You are so impatient. Observe the doctor and learn.

459
00:43:17,866 --> 00:43:22,037
他很满意地等待着重头戏
He's content to wait for the pièce de résistance.

460
00:43:57,447 --> 00:44:01,410
你们都半死了，你们所有人
You're half dead, all of you.

461
00:44:01,577 --> 00:44:04,580
你们已经死了几个世纪了
You've been dead for centuries.

462
00:44:04,746 --> 00:44:08,083
我们明天可能会消失，但我们现在还活着
We may disappear tomorrow, but we're living now.

463
00:44:08,250 --> 00:44:10,169
你们接受不了事实
You can't stand that.

464
00:44:10,335 --> 00:44:13,964
你们半疯了，因为内心空虚
You're half crazy because there's nothing inside.

465
00:44:14,131 --> 00:44:18,844
你们必须折磨我们才能说服自己你们是优越的
You have to torture us to convince yourselves you're superior.

466
00:44:51,585 --> 00:44:54,129
住手，帕门！
Stop it, Parmen!

467
00:44:54,296 --> 00:44:58,133
我会做任何你想做的，我会为你服务，住手！
I'll do whatever you want, I'll serve you, but stop it!

468
00:45:02,137 --> 00:45:03,805
帕门
Parmen.

469
00:45:03,972 --> 00:45:06,475
又是亚历山大
Alexander again.

470
00:45:06,642 --> 00:45:11,813
他喜欢玩刀，很好，我们会满足他的
He likes to play with knives. Very well, we shall indulge him.

471
00:45:45,222 --> 00:45:47,349
谁干的？
Who did that?

472
00:45:51,186 --> 00:45:53,522
- 我干的  - 不可能的！
- I did. - Impossible!

473
00:45:53,689 --> 00:45:57,526
很有可能，并且合乎逻辑
Quite possible. And logical.

474
00:46:01,238 --> 00:46:03,407
- 怎么了？  - 这是怎么回事？
- What is it? - What's going on?

475
00:46:03,573 --> 00:46:08,287
柏拉图人，下一个试着耍花招的人，都会受到伤害
Platonians, the next one of you that tries any trick, will get hurt.

476
00:46:08,453 --> 00:46:12,916
我们拥有两倍于你们的力量水平的意念运动能力
We have your psychokinetic ability at twice your power level.

477
00:46:13,083 --> 00:46:16,169
不是我的两倍
Not twice mine.

478
00:46:42,237 --> 00:46:45,907
舰长，不！
Captain, no!

479
00:46:49,619 --> 00:46:52,414
我求你，我会做你所说的任何事情
I beg of you, I'll do anything you say.

480
00:46:52,581 --> 00:46:55,125
我不想死
I do not wish to die.

481
00:46:59,087 --> 00:47:03,800
舰长？你听到我了吗？
Captain? Do you hear me?

482
00:47:05,344 --> 00:47:07,929
不要阻止我，让我干掉他！
Don't stop me. Let me finish him off!

483
00:47:11,016 --> 00:47:13,268
你想和他一样吗？
You want to be like him?

484
00:47:37,125 --> 00:47:41,338
帕门，听我说，我本可以拥有你的力量，但我不想要它
Parmen, listen to me. I could have had your power, but I didn't want it.

485
00:47:41,505 --> 00:47:44,508
我现在就可以拥有你的位置
I could have had your place right now.

486
00:47:44,674 --> 00:47:49,304
但是看到你和你的学者们让我感到恶心
But the sight of you and your Academicians sickens me.

487
00:47:49,471 --> 00:47:53,975
你是这世上最卑鄙的东西
You're the most contemptible things in this universe.

488
00:48:03,193 --> 00:48:10,075
舰长，你知道我打算摧毁你和<i>企业号</i>
Captain. You knew I intended to destroy both you and the <i>Enterprise</i>.

489
00:48:10,283 --> 00:48:12,661
然而你却饶了我
Yet you spared me.

490
00:48:12,828 --> 00:48:15,831
对我们来说，杀人就是谋杀，即使是为了复仇
To us, killing is murder, even for revenge.

491
00:48:15,997 --> 00:48:18,500
会有其他的星舰…
There will be other starships...

492
00:48:18,667 --> 00:48:21,586
无需担心，他们会是安全的
No need for concern. They'll be safe.

493
00:48:21,795 --> 00:48:26,508
我开始觉得我们变得怪异和没有生产力
I've begun to think we've become bizarre and unproductive,

494
00:48:26,675 --> 00:48:30,887
只是为了滋养我们的力量而存在，是时候呼吸新鲜空气了
existing merely to nourish our powers, it's time for fresh air.

495
00:48:31,054 --> 00:48:34,266
- 我们欢迎你的光临  - 我不相信你
- We'll welcome your visits. - I don't believe you.

496
00:48:34,433 --> 00:48:36,685
那将是不寻常的
That would be uncharacteristic.

497
00:48:36,852 --> 00:48:41,189
我们必须预料到，当我们离开这里的那一刻，你们的恐惧就会消失
We must expect that the moment we leave here, your fear will be gone.

498
00:48:41,356 --> 00:48:43,900
你们会再次变得残酷和傲慢
You'll again be as sadistic and arrogant

499
00:48:44,067 --> 00:48:46,361
正如2500年来的你们样子
as your 2,500 years have made you.

500
00:48:46,528 --> 00:48:49,865
我们可以在几个小时内重新创造这种力量
We can recreate that power in a matter of hours.

501
00:48:50,031 --> 00:48:53,368
所以不要试图耍花招
So don't try anything.

502
00:48:55,537 --> 00:48:58,039
明白了，舰长
Understood, Captain.

503
00:48:58,206 --> 00:49:01,877
你说得对，我们谁都不可信
And you're right, none of us can be trusted.

504
00:49:02,043 --> 00:49:06,256
不受控制的权力甚至会将圣人变成野蛮人
Uncontrolled, power will turn even saints into savages.

505
00:49:06,423 --> 00:49:09,718
我们都活在最低级的冲动中
We all live down to our lowest impulses.

506
00:49:09,885 --> 00:49:13,221
你很擅长演讲
You're very good at making speeches.

507
00:49:13,388 --> 00:49:17,267
只要确保这一点能被理解
Just make sure that this one sinks in.

508
00:49:17,434 --> 00:49:19,561
现在让开
Now move aside.

509
00:49:23,565 --> 00:49:25,066
亚历山大
Alexander.

510
00:49:29,237 --> 00:49:32,616
柯克呼叫<i>企业号</i>，斯科特先生，准备传送我们上去
Kirk to <i>Enterprise</i>. Mr. Scott, prepare to beam us up.

511
00:49:32,782 --> 00:49:35,410
我有一个小惊喜给你
I have a little surprise for you.

512
00:49:35,577 --> 00:49:38,246
我要带一位访客上船
I'm bringing a visitor aboard.
