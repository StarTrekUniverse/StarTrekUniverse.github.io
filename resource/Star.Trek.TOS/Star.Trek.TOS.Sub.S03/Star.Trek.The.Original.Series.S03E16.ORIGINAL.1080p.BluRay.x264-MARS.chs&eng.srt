00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:07,791
[柯克] 舰长日志，星历5423.4
[Kirk] Captain's Log : Star date 5423.4.

2
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:10,535
我们正在绕吉迪恩运行，它还不是
We are orbiting the planet Gideon, which is still not a member...

3
00:00:10,607 --> 00:00:12,527
星际联邦成员
of the United Federation of Planets.

4
00:00:12,594 --> 00:00:14,739
条约谈判一直很艰难
The treaty negotiations have been difficult...

5
00:00:14,814 --> 00:00:16,858
吉迪恩一直拒绝
because Gideon has consistently refused...

6
00:00:16,933 --> 00:00:20,671
联邦代表团踏入他们的国土
the presence of a delegation from the Federation on its soil...

7
00:00:20,742 --> 00:00:23,158
或飞船传感器的任何监视
or any surveillance by the ship's sensors.

8
00:00:23,226 --> 00:00:25,935
他们最终同意由一人组成的代表团
They have finally agreed to a delegation of one.

9
00:00:26,008 --> 00:00:29,509
他们坚持要求是企业号的舰长
They insisted it be the captain of the Enterprise.

10
00:00:29,584 --> 00:00:33,186
因此，我要立即传送下去
I am, therefore, beaming down at once.

11
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:36,003
真可惜吉迪恩不允许集体访问，史波克先生
It's too bad Gideon isn't cleared for general visitation, Mr. Spock.

12
00:00:36,075 --> 00:00:37,858
根据提交给联邦的
According to the physio cultural reports...

13
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:39,816
自然文化报告，它是天堂
submitted to the Federation, it's a paradise.

14
00:00:39,883 --> 00:00:42,356
我很想听听你的描述，舰长
I shall be interested in hearing your description, Captain.

15
00:00:42,434 --> 00:00:45,143
不会让你久等的
You won't have long to wait.

16
00:00:45,215 --> 00:00:47,225
- 乌乎拉上尉  - 是的，史波克先生
- Lieutenant Uhura. - Yes, Mr. Spock.

17
00:00:47,302 --> 00:00:49,255
我们得到吉迪恩的最终批准了吗？
Do we have final clearance from Gideon?

18
00:00:49,322 --> 00:00:52,631
是的，他们为我们提供了坐标
Yes. They have provided us with the coordinates for beam down.

19
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:54,676
把坐标给我好吗？
May I have them, please?

20
00:00:54,753 --> 00:00:57,756
- 875  - 875
- 875. - 875.

21
00:00:57,833 --> 00:01:00,339
- 020  - 020
- 020. - 020.

00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:02,336
[乌乎拉] 079
[Uhura] 079.

23
00:01:02,403 --> 00:01:05,746
079
079.

24
00:01:05,814 --> 00:01:08,162
我们走吧，史波克先生
Let's go, Mr. Spock.

25
00:01:08,232 --> 00:01:10,151
传送
Energizing.

26
00:01:30,992 --> 00:01:33,491
史波克先生？
Mr. Spock?

27
00:01:36,334 --> 00:01:38,932
史波克先生，我还没有被传送下去
Mr. Spock. I have not yet transported down.

28
00:01:39,005 --> 00:01:43,103
你为什么在确认传送之前离开你的岗位？
Why did you leave your post before confirming transport?

29
00:01:43,174 --> 00:01:46,095
史波克先生？
Mr. Spock?

30
00:01:46,171 --> 00:01:48,548
史波克？
Spock?

31
00:02:15,982 --> 00:02:18,917
轮机部？斯科特先生？
Engineering. Mr. Scott?

32
00:02:18,985 --> 00:02:20,919
斯科提？
Scotty!

33
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:26,118
乌乎拉上尉，马上报告
Lieutenant Uhura, report immediately.

34
00:02:27,761 --> 00:02:31,527
所有舰桥人员，立即回答
All bridge personnel, report immediately.

35
00:02:31,598 --> 00:02:35,159
柯克呼叫船员，船上有人吗？
Kirk to crew. Is anyone aboard?

36
00:02:39,339 --> 00:02:41,330
医务室？麦考伊医生？
Sick Bay. Dr. McCoy?

37
00:02:42,609 --> 00:02:45,806
老骨头，老骨头，回答我
Bones? Bones, answer me.

38
00:02:47,347 --> 00:02:49,281
老骨头…
Bones.

39
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:09,617
我们仍在绕吉迪恩运行
We're still orbiting Gideon.

40
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:33,569
[柯克] 宇宙，最后的边疆
[Kirk] Space, the final frontier.

41
00:03:39,585 --> 00:03:43,851
这些是星舰企业号的航程
These are the voyages of the star ship Enterprise.

42
00:03:43,923 --> 00:03:47,859
它的五年任务：探索未知的新世界
Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds,

43
00:03:47,927 --> 00:03:51,920
寻找新生命和新文明
to seek out new life and new civilizations,

44
00:03:51,997 --> 00:03:55,194
勇踏前人未至之境
to boldly go where no man has gone before.

45
00:04:28,185 --> 00:04:30,313
吉迪恩的伤口
The Mark of Gideon

46
00:04:49,636 --> 00:04:52,434
我一个人在企业号上
I'm alone on the Enterprise.

47
00:04:52,505 --> 00:04:56,999
我已经搜遍了船上的每个区域，都找不到船员的踪迹
I have searched the ship and still cannot find a trace of the crew...

48
00:04:57,077 --> 00:05:01,480
或船员如何消失的迹象
or an indication of how its disappearance was managed.

49
00:05:01,548 --> 00:05:04,346
一件事显而易见，我经历了一次失忆
The one thing that is obvious is that I suffered a memory lapse...

50
00:05:04,417 --> 00:05:07,215
在那段时间里，我的手臂受伤了
during which time I bruised my arm.

51
00:05:07,287 --> 00:05:09,619
这让我有些恼火
It is causing me some irritation.

52
00:05:09,689 --> 00:05:13,090
吉迪恩人正在联系我们，史波克先生
Gideon is contacting us, Mr. Spock.

53
00:05:14,661 --> 00:05:16,629
- 把它放在屏幕上  - 是的，长官
- Put it on the screen. - Aye, sir.

54
00:05:18,298 --> 00:05:22,564
柯克舰长，我是霍丁大使
Captain Kirk. This is Ambassador Hodin.

55
00:05:22,636 --> 00:05:25,104
议会正在等待您的到来
The council is still awaiting your arrival.

56
00:05:25,171 --> 00:05:28,231
我是史波克先生，霍丁大使
This is Mr. Spock, Ambassador Hodin.

57
00:05:28,308 --> 00:05:31,004
柯克舰长几分钟前就被传送下去了
Captain Kirk was transported down minutes ago.

58
00:05:31,077 --> 00:05:35,013
- 那不可能，- 我亲自传送的他
- That's impossible. - I transported him myself.

59
00:05:35,081 --> 00:05:38,209
他从未到过
He never arrived.

60
00:05:38,284 --> 00:05:40,775
他被直接传送到了你的议会厅
He was beamed directly to your council chambers.

61
00:05:40,854 --> 00:05:42,845
请验证您的坐标
Please verify your coordinates.

62
00:05:46,226 --> 00:05:48,421
875
875.

63
00:05:48,495 --> 00:05:50,588
020
020.

64
00:05:50,664 --> 00:05:54,031
- 079  - 坐标已确认
- 079. - Coordinates confirmed.

65
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,534
我们给了你准确的坐标
We gave you the exact coordinates,

66
00:05:56,603 --> 00:06:00,505
这应该把柯克舰长带到这个房间里
which should have brought Captain Kirk directly to this very room.

67
00:06:00,573 --> 00:06:02,700
我没有质疑这一点，先生
I am not questioning that, sir.

68
00:06:02,776 --> 00:06:07,475
如果他不在这，史波克先生
If he is not here, that is your own responsibility, Mr. Spock,

69
00:06:07,547 --> 00:06:09,481
那是你自己和你的员工的责任
and that of your staff.

70
00:06:09,549 --> 00:06:14,384
我不否认这一点，我并不是要责怪你们的人员
I do not deny that, sir. I am not attempting to blame your personnel.

71
00:06:14,454 --> 00:06:16,388
很高兴听到它
We are glad to hear that.

72
00:06:16,456 --> 00:06:21,052
我们将把它记入这次不幸事件的记录中
We shall enter it into the records of this most unfortunate event.

73
00:06:21,127 --> 00:06:24,494
阁下，即使有像我们这样
Your Excellency, even with intricate machinery...

74
00:06:24,564 --> 00:06:26,498
微妙平衡的复杂机器
as delicately balanced as ours,

75
00:06:26,566 --> 00:06:29,330
也有处理错误的余地
there is still a margin for error which must be dealt with.

76
00:06:29,402 --> 00:06:31,370
有可能柯克舰长
It is possible that Captain Kirk...

77
00:06:31,438 --> 00:06:34,407
在吉迪恩的另一处物质化
materialized on some other part of Gideon.

78
00:06:34,474 --> 00:06:36,533
希望是在陆地上
Let us hope it was on dry land.

79
00:06:36,609 --> 00:06:40,670
阁下
Your Excellency.

80
00:06:40,747 --> 00:06:42,738
我可以切入正题吗？
May I cut right to the heart of the matter?

81
00:06:42,816 --> 00:06:47,685
请允许我传送下来进行搜索
I request permission to beam down.

82
00:06:47,754 --> 00:06:52,714
拒绝，你们联邦一定知道我们坚守的传统
Permission denied.Your Federation must be aware of our jealous tradition of isolation...

83
00:06:52,792 --> 00:06:55,590
避免一切污染性接触
from all contaminating contacts...

84
00:06:55,662 --> 00:06:59,621
与其他星系行星的暴力性质隔离开来
with a violent nature of planets of other star systems.

85
00:06:59,699 --> 00:07:03,931
阁下，敌对星系之间的战争
Your Excellency, the wars between opposing star systems...

86
00:07:04,003 --> 00:07:06,995
在我们的星系中不再盛行
no longer prevail in our galaxy.

87
00:07:07,073 --> 00:07:08,665
如果您能授予权限…
If you will grant permission

88
00:07:08,742 --> 00:07:11,210
我们将进行彻底的搜索
Of course, we shall institute a thorough search.

89
00:07:11,277 --> 00:07:16,112
与此同时，史波克先生，我建议您检查一下你的机器
In the meantime, I suggest that you look to your machinery.

90
00:07:16,182 --> 00:07:18,207
[舒一口气] 
[ Sighs ] 

91
00:07:18,284 --> 00:07:22,983
我们必须彻底承认外交的目的
We must acknowledge once and for all that the purpose of diplomacy...

92
00:07:23,056 --> 00:07:25,991
是延长危机
is to prolong a crisis.

93
00:07:26,059 --> 00:07:28,926
那我们还在等什么？我们又不是外交官
Well, what are we waiting for? We're not diplomats!

94
00:07:28,995 --> 00:07:31,759
我们是联邦的代表，医生
We are representatives of the Federation, Doctor.

95
00:07:31,831 --> 00:07:37,201
这并不意味着我们必须表现得像孩子一样，听外交官的愚蠢演讲
That doesn't mean we have to listen to some fool lecture by a diplomat!

96
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:40,899
不幸的是，外交是我们目前唯一可用的方式
Unfortunately, diplomacy is the only channel available at the moment.

97
00:07:40,974 --> 00:07:44,705
星球屏蔽了我们的传感器，我们无法扫描它
The planet is shielded from our sensors. We cannot scan it.

98
00:07:44,778 --> 00:07:49,545
我们无法选择坐标，必须由吉迪恩人提供
We are unable to select coordinates. They must be provided by Gideon.

99
00:07:49,616 --> 00:07:52,244
我们就不应该同意规定
We should never have agreed to such restrictions.

100
00:07:52,318 --> 00:07:56,084
我们没有，契科夫先生，是联邦
We did not, Mr. Chekov. The Federation did.

101
00:07:56,156 --> 00:07:58,090
- 乌乎拉上尉  - 是的，史波克先生
- Lieutenant Uhura. - Yes, Mr. Spock.

102
00:07:58,158 --> 00:08:00,854
立即联系星际舰队，说明我们的问题
Contact Starfleet immediately. Explain our problem.

103
00:08:00,927 --> 00:08:03,418
请求允许使用我们可以使用的一切手段
Request permission to use every means at our disposal...

104
00:08:03,496 --> 00:08:05,157
来搜寻柯克舰长
to press the search for Captain Kirk.

105
00:08:05,231 --> 00:08:09,895
- 马上，长官  - 有其他可能吗？
- At once, sir. - Are there any other possibilities?

106
00:08:09,969 --> 00:08:12,130
有无数可能，契科夫先生
There are endless, Mr. Chekov.

107
00:08:12,205 --> 00:08:14,537
那我们从哪里开始，史波克先生？
Well, where do we start, Mr. Spock?

108
00:08:14,607 --> 00:08:18,168
使用传感器扫描360度
Institute a sensor scan 360 degrees,

109
00:08:18,244 --> 00:08:21,008
每次1度
one degree at a time.

110
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:23,378
你是说你要为他扫描空间？
You mean you're gonna scan space for him?

111
00:08:23,449 --> 00:08:28,113
- 但这可能需要数年时间  - 那么越早开始越好
- But, sir, that could take years. - The sooner you begin, the better.

112
00:08:28,621 --> 00:08:30,918
是的，长官
Aye, sir.

113
00:08:37,063 --> 00:08:39,156
[开门] 
[Door Opens] 

114
00:08:58,751 --> 00:09:00,810
你是谁？
Who are you?

115
00:09:03,556 --> 00:09:08,357
奥多纳，是的，我的名字是奥多纳
Odona! Yes, my name is Odona.

116
00:09:09,729 --> 00:09:12,220
你为什么把我带来这里？
Why did you bring me here?

117
00:09:12,298 --> 00:09:14,528
你在我的船上做什么？
What are you doing on my ship?

118
00:09:16,836 --> 00:09:19,805
这整艘船是你的吗？
Is this entire ship yours?

119
00:09:19,873 --> 00:09:22,899
不是我的私人财产，但我是舰长
Not my personal property, but I'm the captain.

120
00:09:22,976 --> 00:09:25,809
你拥有这一切吗？
Oh, and you have it all to yourself?

121
00:09:25,879 --> 00:09:28,780
目前看来，是我们拥有一切
It seems, at the moment, we have it all to ourselves.

122
00:09:28,848 --> 00:09:30,247
噢！
Oh!

123
00:09:30,316 --> 00:09:33,547
你弄疼我了，舰长
You're hurting me, Captain

124
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:38,148
柯克，抱歉，詹姆斯·柯克，而且不是我带你来的
Kirk. I'm sorry. James Kirk. And I didn't bring you here.

125
00:09:38,224 --> 00:09:41,990
- 如果不是你带我来的…  - 是的，谁带你来的？
- If you didn't bring me... - That's right. Who brought you here?

126
00:09:43,062 --> 00:09:44,996
我不知道
I don't know.

127
00:09:45,064 --> 00:09:47,430
你…
You

128
00:09:50,969 --> 00:09:52,768
你来之前发生了什么？
What happened before you came here?

129
00:09:54,107 --> 00:09:56,974
试着回忆，这很重要
Try to remember. It's important.

130
00:09:59,545 --> 00:10:02,981
我好像站在一个…
It seems I was standing in a

131
00:10:03,049 --> 00:10:06,382
是的，我站在一个大礼堂里
Yes. I was standing in a large auditorium...

132
00:10:06,452 --> 00:10:08,443
挤满了人
crowded with people.

133
00:10:08,521 --> 00:10:12,116
成千上万人紧贴在我身上，我几乎无法呼吸
Thousands pressed in against me. I could hardly breathe.

134
00:10:12,191 --> 00:10:16,628
我在为氧气而战，尖叫着要出去
I was fighting for oxygen, screaming to get out.

135
00:10:18,131 --> 00:10:20,861
不要害怕
Don't be afraid.

136
00:10:20,934 --> 00:10:24,529
我没有，但你有麻烦了
I'm not, but you are troubled.

137
00:10:24,604 --> 00:10:29,701
我似乎是我的船员中唯一留在企业号上的人
I seem to be the only one of my crew left on board the Enterprise.

138
00:10:29,776 --> 00:10:32,301
430个人
Four hundred and thirty,

139
00:10:32,378 --> 00:10:36,371
显然我是唯一留下的
and l, apparently, am the only one left.

140
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:40,114
抱歉，我希望我能帮上忙
I'm sorry. I wish I could help.

141
00:10:40,186 --> 00:10:43,349
也许你可以，把剩下的告诉我
Maybe you can. Tell me the rest.

142
00:10:43,423 --> 00:10:48,258
你是在为氧气而战吗？尖叫着离开那里？
You were fighting for oxygen, screaming to get out of there.

143
00:10:48,328 --> 00:10:52,992
然后突然，我就在这里,在你的船上了
And then l... Suddenly I was here on this, on your ship.

144
00:10:53,066 --> 00:10:55,125
还有这么多空间
And there was all this space.

145
00:10:55,201 --> 00:10:58,967
和自由，我只想摇摆
And the freedom! I just wanted to float!

146
00:11:00,873 --> 00:11:03,637
然后你就在那里了
And then, there you were.

147
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:06,440
你登上企业号多久了？
How long have you been aboard the Enterprise?

148
00:11:06,512 --> 00:11:09,174
我不知道，不久
I don't know. Not long.

149
00:11:10,683 --> 00:11:13,948
- 这重要吗？  - 有可能，跟我来
- Is it important? - It might be. Come with me.

150
00:11:15,922 --> 00:11:20,086
乌乎拉上尉，星际舰队回应我们的请求了吗？
Lieutenant Uhura, has Starfleet honored our request with a reply?

151
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:22,320
还没有回应，长官
There has been no response as yet, sir.

152
00:11:22,395 --> 00:11:25,455
你有没有告诉他们舰长的生命危在旦夕？
Did you advise them the captain's life is at stake?

153
00:11:25,531 --> 00:11:29,627
是的，长官，他们坚持必须将其提交给联邦
Yes, sir. They insist the matter must be referred to the Federation.

154
00:11:29,702 --> 00:11:32,136
- 什么部门？  - 行星条约局
- What department? - The Bureau of Planetary Treaties.

155
00:11:32,205 --> 00:11:35,436
- 直接联系他们  - 我联系了，史波克先生
- Contact them directly. - I did, Mr. Spock.

156
00:11:35,508 --> 00:11:38,170
他们要求我们必须通过星际舰队的渠道
They insist that we must go through Starfleet channels.

157
00:11:43,883 --> 00:11:47,649
舰长失踪，这就是他们想出的最好的办法？
With the captain lost, that's the best they could come up with?

158
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:51,247
外交官和官僚的职能可能不同
Diplomats and bureaucrats may function differently,

159
00:11:51,324 --> 00:11:54,555
但达到了完全相同的结果
but they achieve exactly the same results.

160
00:12:02,014 --> 00:12:05,882
我生命中少了九分钟
Nine minutes of my life has been lost.

161
00:12:05,951 --> 00:12:07,543
我不明白
I don't understand.

162
00:12:07,619 --> 00:12:09,780
从我传送到吉迪恩
Between the time I tried to beam down to Gideon...

163
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:13,256
到发现自己在这儿，时间过了九分钟
and the time I found myself here, nine minutes have disappeared.

164
00:12:13,325 --> 00:12:18,160
- 那段时间发生了什么？  - 什么是吉迪恩？
- What happened during those minutes? - What is Gideon?

165
00:12:20,065 --> 00:12:24,297
那是你的家乡，你来的星球
That's your home, the planet that you come from.

166
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:26,702
- 是吗？  - 嗯，一定是
- Is it? - Well, it must be.

167
00:12:28,741 --> 00:12:32,336
吉- 吉迪恩？我不知道什么吉迪恩
G- Gideon? I don't know any Gideon.

168
00:12:32,411 --> 00:12:35,175
这不可能
It's impossible.

169
00:12:35,247 --> 00:12:38,080
我们在吉迪恩上空的同步轨道上
We were in synchronous orbit over the capital city of Gideon.

170
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:40,414
我试着传送下去，出了岔子
I tried to beam down, something happened,

171
00:12:40,486 --> 00:12:42,852
你被从吉迪恩传送上船了
and you were beamed aboard from Gideon!

172
00:12:46,025 --> 00:12:48,516
我不这么认为
I do not think so.

173
00:12:57,090 --> 00:12:59,217
我们不再在吉迪恩上空了
We're no longer over Gideon.

174
00:12:59,292 --> 00:13:01,226
- 我们在哪？  - 我不知道
- Where are we? - I don't know.

175
00:13:01,294 --> 00:13:05,060
我不熟悉那个象限
I'm not familiar with that quadrant.

176
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:09,430
奥多纳
Odona,

177
00:13:09,502 --> 00:13:13,097
你必须意识到我们不是偶然来到这里的
you must realize that we're not here by accident.

178
00:13:13,172 --> 00:13:16,300
某种力量，某种智慧
Some force, some intelligence...

179
00:13:16,375 --> 00:13:21,176
为了某种目的…安排了这一切
has arranged this for a purpose.

180
00:13:21,247 --> 00:13:25,980
舰长，之前我说我不害怕
Captain, before I said I wasn't afraid.

181
00:13:26,052 --> 00:13:28,577
现在我怕了
Now I am.

182
00:13:43,601 --> 00:13:47,367
大使要说话，他们要求可视通信
The ambassador will speak. They're requesting visual communication.

183
00:13:47,439 --> 00:13:49,873
好消息！非常好的消息，史波克先生
Good news! Very good news indeed, Mr. Spock.

184
00:13:49,941 --> 00:13:53,604
你的舰长绝对不在吉迪恩，根据你的要求
Your captain is definitely not on Gideon. As you requested,

185
00:13:53,678 --> 00:13:56,647
我们进行了最彻底的搜索
we made a most thorough search, and you will be relieved to know...

186
00:13:56,715 --> 00:13:59,548
你可以放心调查其他可能性
that you may now investigate all the other possibilities...

187
00:13:59,617 --> 00:14:01,084
别管吉迪恩了
and forget about Gideon.

188
00:14:01,152 --> 00:14:04,246
但，呃，那不是我们要求的
But, uh, that is not what we requested.

189
00:14:04,322 --> 00:14:08,315
你要求进行最彻底的搜索，有记录的
You requested a most thorough search. It is in the record.

190
00:14:08,393 --> 00:14:12,022
我们已尽一切可能为您提供方便
And we have used every means at our disposal to accommodate you.

191
00:14:12,097 --> 00:14:14,588
你对这个问题的记录…
Your record on the subject...

192
00:14:14,666 --> 00:14:18,625
不准确，阁下
is not precise, Your Excellency.

193
00:14:18,703 --> 00:14:22,161
[听不见的对话] 
[No Audible Dialogue] 

194
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:26,006
当然，史波克先生，呃，我希望你不打算
Surely, Mr. Spock, uh, you do not intend, I hope,

195
00:14:26,077 --> 00:14:29,342
在联邦和吉迪恩之间制造争端
to create a dispute between the Federation and Gideon?

196
00:14:29,414 --> 00:14:33,475
阁下，争端是我们最不想发生的事
Your Excellency, a dispute is the farthest thing from our minds,

197
00:14:33,551 --> 00:14:37,282
而且无需检查您的记录
and there's no need to check your records.

198
00:14:37,355 --> 00:14:40,449
我只是想说我们声明的措辞
I merely suggest that the language of our statement...

199
00:14:40,525 --> 00:14:46,054
可能没有完全按照预期 被理解
may not have been understood... exactly as intended.

200
00:14:46,131 --> 00:14:48,599
史波克先生，你是一艘宇宙飞船的军官
Mr. Spock, you're an officer of a spaceship.

201
00:14:48,666 --> 00:14:51,066
在你的职业生涯中，你使用许多工具
In your profession, you use many instruments,

202
00:14:51,136 --> 00:14:53,536
武器来实现你的目标
tools and weapons to achieve your objectives.

203
00:14:53,605 --> 00:14:55,539
是的，阁下
True, Your Excellency.

204
00:14:55,607 --> 00:14:59,475
然而，外交唯一的工具就是语言
However, the only tool diplomacy has is language.

205
00:14:59,544 --> 00:15:03,878
最重要的是要清楚地表达意思
It is of the utmost importance that the meaning be crystal clear.

206
00:15:03,948 --> 00:15:08,351
阁下，我主要是一名科学家
Your Excellency, I am basically a scientist.

207
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:12,151
在我的职业中，清晰的表述也是必不可少的
Clarity of formulation is essential in my profession also.

208
00:15:12,223 --> 00:15:16,091
我很高兴听到你这么说，也许你可以更努力地
I'm glad to hear it. Perhaps you could then make greater effort...

209
00:15:16,161 --> 00:15:20,495
选择更准确的词
to choose your words more precisely.

210
00:15:20,565 --> 00:15:23,159
你就让他这么糊弄过去？
Are you gonna let him get away with that?

211
00:15:23,234 --> 00:15:25,031
史波克先生，不管你说什么，他都会曲解你的意思
No matter what you say, Mr. Spock, he'll twist your meaning.

212
00:15:25,103 --> 00:15:27,594
是的，他很气人，长官，你怎么能忍的？
Yes, he's infuriating, sir. How can you stand it?

213
00:15:27,672 --> 00:15:31,870
确定一切都已经完成前我们不能离开
We cannot leave without being sure that everything has been done.

214
00:15:31,943 --> 00:15:34,741
现在你当然理解我们对此的感受
Now certainly you understand our feelings about that.

215
00:15:34,813 --> 00:15:38,579
- 史波克先生！史波克先生！  - 是的，阁下
- Mr. Spock! Mr. Spock! - Yes, Your Excellency.

216
00:15:38,650 --> 00:15:41,517
- 你还在吗？  - 是的，阁下
- Are you still there? - Yes, Your Excellency.

217
00:15:41,586 --> 00:15:44,350
你的传输受受到很大干扰
There was considerable interference with your transmission.

218
00:15:44,422 --> 00:15:47,118
噪音淹没了所说的话，
A lot of noise drowned out what was said.

219
00:15:47,192 --> 00:15:51,959
- 请你重复一遍好吗？  - 很抱歉有噪音，阁下
- Would you repeat, please? - I apologize for the noise.

220
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:55,989
总之，我请求允许传送到吉迪恩
To summarize, I request permission to transport down to Gideon.

221
00:15:56,067 --> 00:16:00,333
原谅我，史波克先生，无意批评你们的设备
Forgive me, Mr. Spock. No criticism of your equipment was intended.

222
00:16:00,405 --> 00:16:03,499
但它让你的舰长踏上了一段奇怪的旅程
But it has sent your captain on some strange journey,

223
00:16:03,575 --> 00:16:05,236
但愿是安全的
a safe one we all hope.

224
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:09,337
但这可能导致我们与你们联邦之间严重的冲突
But it could create for us serious incidents with your Federation,

225
00:16:09,414 --> 00:16:13,214
现在你打算和另一位军官重蹈覆辙？
and now you propose to repeat this disaster with another officer.

226
00:16:13,284 --> 00:16:17,516
- 真是疯狂  - 我不接受，史波克先生
- This would be madness. - I'll not take that, Mr. Spock!

227
00:16:17,589 --> 00:16:21,787
传送装置状况良好，我亲自保证
That transporter was in perfect condition. I guarantee that myself!

228
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:25,956
传送我下去，我会向那些人证明…
Transport me down right this minute, and I'll prove to those...

229
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:28,191
- 先生们  - 斯科特先生
- gentlemen. - Mr. Scott,

230
00:16:28,266 --> 00:16:30,700
你去传送室等待我的命令
you'll go to the transporter room and await my orders.

231
00:16:30,768 --> 00:16:34,363
是的，史波克先生[抱怨] 
Aye, Mr. Spock. [Grumbling] 

232
00:16:36,307 --> 00:16:38,468
[霍丁] 我无法理解，史波克先生
[Hodin] I could not quite make that out, Mr. Spock.

233
00:16:38,543 --> 00:16:41,376
你能重复你说的话吗？
Would you be so good as to repeat what you said?

234
00:16:41,446 --> 00:16:44,677
是的，阁下，飞船的轮机长正在解释
Yes, Your Excellency. The ship's engineer was explaining...

235
00:16:44,749 --> 00:16:49,277
故障，确实存在，现在已修复
that the malfunction, which did exist, has now been repaired.

236
00:16:49,354 --> 00:16:52,517
我们希望有机会测试设备
We would appreciate an opportunity to test the equipment.

237
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:56,492
请允许我传送到你们的议会厅
I, therefore, request permission to beam down to your council chamber.

238
00:16:56,561 --> 00:16:58,722
但是，史波克先生，你…
But, Mr. Spock, you

239
00:16:58,796 --> 00:17:02,755
阁下，请准许这一请求
Your Excellency, grant this one request.

240
00:17:02,834 --> 00:17:06,235
你是一个非常执着的人，史波克先生
You are a very persistent fellow, Mr. Spock.

241
00:17:09,711 --> 00:17:11,502
那好吧，呃…
Very well, then, uh

242
00:17:11,955 --> 00:17:16,391
你能测试你那非常易怒的修理工的技术
You shall test the skill of your very excitable repairman.

243
00:17:16,889 --> 00:17:21,105
有一个附带条件，我们不能冒进一步冲突的风险
There is one proviso. We cannot risk further incidents.

244
00:17:21,597 --> 00:17:26,196
因此，你将把我的一名员工传送到你的船上
You will, therefore, transport a member of my staff to your ship.

245
00:17:26,196 --> 00:17:27,912
让我们先看看这是否行得通
Let us first see if that works.

246
00:17:27,985 --> 00:17:31,642
谢谢，阁下，接受你的提议
Thank you, Your Excellency. Your proposal is accepted.

247
00:17:34,948 --> 00:17:36,626
- 斯科特先生  - 我是斯科特
- Mr. Scott. - Scott here.

248
00:17:36,626 --> 00:17:39,839
准备传送吉迪恩议会代表上船
Prepare to beam aboard a representative of the Gideon council.

249
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:40,809
是的，长官
Aye, aye, sir.

250
00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:43,237
我的助手会为你提供正确的…
My assistant will provide you with the proper

251
00:17:43,237 --> 00:17:45,858
- 怎么说的？- 坐标，
- What is the word? - [Spock] Coordinates.

252
00:17:46,481 --> 00:17:48,995
谢谢，继续，克罗达克
Thank you. Proceed, Krodak.

253
00:17:53,368 --> 00:17:56,201
- 875  - [斯科特] 875
- 875. - [Scott] 875.

254
00:17:56,271 --> 00:17:58,205
- 020
- 020.

255
00:17:58,273 --> 00:18:02,039
- [斯科特] 020  - [克罗达克] 709
- [Scott] 020. - [Krodak] 709.

256
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:03,975
709
709.

257
00:18:04,946 --> 00:18:06,971
传送
Energizing.

258
00:18:20,146 --> 00:18:23,047
史波克先生，来自吉迪恩的先生到了
Mr. Spock, the gentleman from Gideon is here.

259
00:18:23,115 --> 00:18:26,607
阁下，您的助理已安全抵达
Your Excellency, your assistant has arrived safely,

260
00:18:26,685 --> 00:18:29,518
我现在准备传送到吉迪恩
and I am now ready to transport down to Gideon.

261
00:18:29,588 --> 00:18:33,354
别那么快，史波克先生
Now, now, not so fast, Mr. Spock.

262
00:18:33,426 --> 00:18:36,827
那完全是另一回事，我们一致同意允许
That is quite a different matter. We agreed to allow...

263
00:18:36,896 --> 00:18:40,195
一名代表踏上我们的土地，你的舰长
one representative on our soilyour captain.

264
00:18:40,266 --> 00:18:43,895
先生，我们的舰长仍然下落不明
Sir, our captain is still missing,

265
00:18:43,969 --> 00:18:49,202
我现在要求允许我按照我们的约定传送到吉迪恩
and I now demand that I be allowed to transport to Gideon as we agreed.

266
00:18:49,275 --> 00:18:51,209
请原谅我，史波克先生
Forgive me, Mr. Spock,

267
00:18:51,277 --> 00:18:55,338
但我在达成该协议时越权了
but I overstepped my authority when I made that agreement.

268
00:18:55,414 --> 00:18:58,315
然而，你的请求将会得到处理
However, your request will be taken up...

269
00:18:58,384 --> 00:19:01,547
在吉迪恩议会的下一次全体会议上
at the next full session of Gideon's council.

270
00:19:11,263 --> 00:19:14,232
斯科特先生，把来自吉迪恩的先生传送下去
Mr. Scott, beam down the gentleman from Gideon.

271
00:19:14,299 --> 00:19:16,927
是的，史波克先生，我正将他直接发送到相同的坐标
Yes, Mr. Spock. I'm sending him straight to the same coordinates.

272
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:21,307
就在我开始认为你可能会找到
Just when I was beginning to think you might find...

273
00:19:21,376 --> 00:19:23,588
一份外交官的新职业的时候，史波克先生
a whole new career as a diplomat, Mr. Spock.

274
00:19:23,663 --> 00:19:28,432
不要放弃希望，医生，乌乎拉上尉，联系星际舰队指挥部
Do not give up hope, Doctor. Lieutenant Uhura, contact Starfleet Command.

275
00:19:28,504 --> 00:19:30,751
要求立即回复我们
Demand an immediate reply to our request...

276
00:19:30,825 --> 00:19:32,774
传送至吉迪恩的请求
for permission to beam down to Gideon.

277
00:19:32,842 --> 00:19:34,951
是的，史波克先生
Yes, Mr. Spock.

278
00:19:35,027 --> 00:19:37,239
企业号呼叫星际舰队指挥部
Enterprise to Starfleet Command.

279
00:19:37,313 --> 00:19:39,262
企业号呼叫星际舰队指挥部

00:19:39,466 --> 00:19:41,609
企业号呼叫星际舰队指挥部

00:19:41,685 --> 00:19:45,044
企业号呼叫星际舰队指挥部
Enterprise to Starfleet Command.

282
00:19:45,114 --> 00:19:49,609
我是柯克舰长，红色优先级，红色优先级
Captain Kirk here. Red priority. Red priority.

283
00:19:49,687 --> 00:19:52,679
- 它不在工作状态？  - 好像是
- Isn't it in working order? - It seems to be.

284
00:19:52,748 --> 00:19:55,064
那么应该有人听到了你
Then someone should have heard you.

285
00:19:55,135 --> 00:19:58,460
我是柯克舰长，请回答红色优先级
Captain Kirk here. Please answer red priority.

286
00:19:58,531 --> 00:20:02,361
请回答红色优先级
Please answer red priority.

287
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:07,235
如果有人在听，但他们不回答
Well, if someone is listening, they're not answering.

288
00:20:07,307 --> 00:20:09,256
他们为什么要这样做？
Why should they do that?

289
00:20:12,173 --> 00:20:13,359
他们不会
They wouldn't.

290
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:25,722
- 你做了什么？  - 带我们脱离了曲速
- What did you do? - Took the ship out of warp speed.

291
00:20:25,796 --> 00:20:28,162
- 脱离什么？  - 空间术语
- Out of what? - Space terminology.

292
00:20:28,232 --> 00:20:30,757
我们不再以超光速移动
We're no longer moving faster than the speed of light.

293
00:20:30,834 --> 00:20:33,769
我减到了亚光速，直到查明我们的位置
I've trimmed down to sub-light speed until we find out where we are.

294
00:20:33,837 --> 00:20:36,704
- 感觉一样  - 当然一样
- It feels the same. - Of course it does.

295
00:20:40,077 --> 00:20:41,792
也许就是一样的
Maybe it is the same.

296
00:20:49,913 --> 00:20:52,279
那么，船慢下来了吗？
Well, has the ship slowed down?

297
00:20:55,585 --> 00:20:58,918
如果你相信，是的
If you can believe that, we have.

298
00:20:58,989 --> 00:21:02,686
拜托，别告诉我现在天空出故障了
Oh, please! Don't tell me the sky is out of order now.

299
00:21:10,166 --> 00:21:12,930
真安静
So quiet.

300
00:21:13,003 --> 00:21:15,096
真平静
So peaceful.

301
00:21:15,171 --> 00:21:17,196
实际并不，你知道的
It isn't really, you know.

302
00:21:26,182 --> 00:21:28,116
它很漂亮
And it's beautiful!

303
00:21:33,623 --> 00:21:36,649
是的，它是
Yes. Yes, it is.

304
00:21:36,726 --> 00:21:38,694
非常，非常漂亮
Very, very beautiful.

305
00:21:38,762 --> 00:21:40,957
只有我们
And we're alone.

306
00:21:41,031 --> 00:21:43,499
你能让它持续很长时间吗？
Can you make it last a long, long time?

307
00:21:43,567 --> 00:21:46,331
你希望它持续多久？
How long would you like it to last?

308
00:21:47,404 --> 00:21:51,272
- 永远  - 让我们看看
- Forever. - Well, let's see.

309
00:21:51,341 --> 00:21:56,278
能量，那不是问题，它能再生，还有食物
Power, that's no problem: it regenerates. And food. We

310
00:21:56,346 --> 00:22:00,214
我们有足够的食物养活430名船员五年
We have enough to feed a crew of 430 for five years.

311
00:22:00,283 --> 00:22:02,444
- 所以这应该够我们用…  - 永远
- So that should last us... - Forever.

312
00:22:04,287 --> 00:22:06,881
我一生都梦想着独处
All my life I've dreamed of being alone.

313
00:22:06,957 --> 00:22:08,822
大多数人都害怕孤独
Most people are afraid of being alone.

314
00:22:08,892 --> 00:22:12,259
我的故乡，人们梦寐以求
Where I come from, people dream of it.

315
00:22:12,329 --> 00:22:15,856
为什么？为什么吉迪恩的人会这样？
Why? Why are the people of Gideon like that?

316
00:22:17,003 --> 00:22:18,498
吉迪恩？
Gideon?

317
00:22:19,994 --> 00:22:24,090
我告诉过你我不知道我来自哪里，我的星球是什么
I told you, I don't know where I come from, what my planet is.

318
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:29,702
- 可能是吉迪恩  - 有那么重要吗？
- It might be Gideon. - Does it matter so much?

319
00:22:29,779 --> 00:22:33,579
是的，它也许能帮我确定我们的位置
Yes. It might help me pinpoint our location.

320
00:22:36,013 --> 00:22:37,619
你也许能找到你的船员
And then you might find your crew.

321
00:22:37,687 --> 00:22:42,283
和你在一起，我忘了一定还有其他人
Being here with you, I forgot there must be others.

322
00:22:42,359 --> 00:22:45,954
我羡慕你的忠诚
I envy you your sense of loyalty.

323
00:22:46,029 --> 00:22:49,055
我想减轻你的恐惧感
I want to ease your feeling of dread,

324
00:22:49,132 --> 00:22:52,659
你担心你所有的船员都不复存在了
your fear that all your crew no longer exists.

325
00:23:01,687 --> 00:23:05,776
我必须联系操控我们的人
I've got to contact whoever is manipulating us.

326
00:23:05,849 --> 00:23:08,875
一定有办法
There must be a way!

327
00:23:08,952 --> 00:23:13,184
奥多纳，你能…
Odona, can you...

328
00:23:13,256 --> 00:23:16,748
记得为什么你们的人会梦想独处吗？
remember why your people dream of being alone?

329
00:23:19,195 --> 00:23:23,461
- 因为他们永远不可能  - 为什么？
- Because they never can be. - Why?

330
00:23:28,605 --> 00:23:31,768
是什么让独处如此不可能？
What makes it so impossible to be alone?

331
00:23:33,243 --> 00:23:37,077
因为我们人太多了，太多了
Because there are so many of us. So many.

332
00:23:37,147 --> 00:23:40,583
没有位置，
There is no place,

333
00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:43,278
没有街道，没有房子，
no street, no house,

334
00:23:43,353 --> 00:23:46,288
没有花园，没有海滩
no garden, no beach,

335
00:23:46,356 --> 00:23:50,258
没有没有人的山
no mountain that is not filled with people.

336
00:23:50,326 --> 00:23:52,294
我们每个人都会杀人
Each one of us would kill...

337
00:23:52,362 --> 00:23:57,299
为了找到一个属于自己的地方而
in order to find a place alone to himself.

338
00:23:57,367 --> 00:24:00,530
他们愿意为此而死
Yet would willingly die for it,

339
00:24:00,603 --> 00:24:02,628
如果可以的话
if they could.

340
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:12,705
谁派你来的？
Who sent you here?

341
00:24:12,782 --> 00:24:14,807
没有人命令奥多纳
No one commands Odona!

342
00:24:14,884 --> 00:24:17,512
我不是被派到这里的
I was not sent here.

343
00:24:20,757 --> 00:24:22,748
你是来杀人的？
You have come to kill?

344
00:24:27,731 --> 00:24:31,531
奥多纳，你是来死的吗？
Odona, have you come to die?

345
00:24:34,437 --> 00:24:37,497
我不知道，我不在乎
I don't know. I don't care!

346
00:24:38,608 --> 00:24:41,543
我只知道我在这里
I only know I'm here.

347
00:24:41,611 --> 00:24:44,171
我只知道我很开心
I only know I'm happy.

348
00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:27,848
现在我所要做的就是找到一个医疗箱，
Now, all I have to do is find a medical kit,

349
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:30,911
我可以完全治愈它
and I can completely cure this.

350
00:25:30,989 --> 00:25:34,447
- 治愈？  - 是的，发炎会消失
- Cure? - Yes, the irritation would be gone.

351
00:25:34,526 --> 00:25:37,461
如果你没有找到会发生什么？
What will happen if you do not find one?

352
00:25:37,529 --> 00:25:39,463
你会生病并死去吗？
Will you become sick and die?

353
00:25:39,531 --> 00:25:42,591
哦，不，这么小的伤不会
Oh, no. Over something as simple as this?

354
00:25:42,667 --> 00:25:45,568
不，它最终会自行痊愈，但是…
No, It'll cure itself eventually, but

355
00:25:49,708 --> 00:25:51,642
你知道吗，
Do you know, uh

356
00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:55,441
我甚至不记得这是怎么发生的
I don't even remember how this happened.

357
00:25:55,514 --> 00:25:58,415
[连续轻击声] 
[Soft Thrumming] 

358
00:25:58,483 --> 00:26:00,815
你听到了吗？
Do you hear that?

359
00:26:00,886 --> 00:26:04,515
是的，听起来像一个引擎
Yes. It sounds like an engine.

360
00:26:04,589 --> 00:26:06,523
不
No.

361
00:26:06,591 --> 00:26:09,924
这艘飞船的引擎不会发出那种声音
The ship's engines don't make that kind of sound.

362
00:26:09,995 --> 00:26:13,362
但是设备有问题，会是这样吗？
But there is something wrong with the equipment. Could that be it?

363
00:26:13,431 --> 00:26:16,127
我知道这艘船可能发出的每一种声音
I know every sound that this ship might make.

364
00:26:17,836 --> 00:26:21,101
那是外面传来的
That's coming from outside.

365
00:26:21,173 --> 00:26:24,301
- 一场风暴…  - 有可能是风暴
- A storm might... - A storm might

366
00:26:25,744 --> 00:26:29,077
但是你听不到它
But you wouldn't be able to hear it.

367
00:26:29,147 --> 00:26:31,342
来吧
Come on.

368
00:26:37,822 --> 00:26:40,382
这是一个观景台，我们能看到外面
This is a viewing port. We'll be able to see outside.

369
00:26:40,458 --> 00:26:44,087
如果有风暴，我们将能够看到它
If there's a storm, we'll be able to see it.

370
00:26:45,709 --> 00:26:47,356
如果行得通
If it works.

371
00:27:00,966 --> 00:27:04,715
人，人的面孔
People. The faces of people!

372
00:27:06,133 --> 00:27:09,310
然后是星星
And then the stars.

373
00:27:13,694 --> 00:27:17,289
发生了什么？外面有什么？
What's happening? What's out there?

374
00:27:17,963 --> 00:27:20,261
[轻击声停止] 
[Thrumming Stops] 

375
00:27:26,471 --> 00:27:30,567
声音没了
The sound is gone.

376
00:27:30,642 --> 00:27:32,576
像那些人的心跳
It was like the heartbeat of all those people,

377
00:27:32,644 --> 00:27:36,774
还有成千上万的人，压在船上
and thousands upon thousands more, pressing against the ship.

378
00:27:39,477 --> 00:27:41,877
但你说我们正在穿越太空
But you said we were moving through space.

379
00:27:42,659 --> 00:27:44,155
是的，我说过
Yes, I said that.

380
00:27:44,155 --> 00:27:46,123
那么人们不可能在外面
Then the people can't be out there.

381
00:27:46,902 --> 00:27:48,343
是的他们可以
Yes, they can.

382
00:27:49,241 --> 00:27:50,790
请不要吓唬我
Please don't frighten me.

383
00:27:55,767 --> 00:28:00,431
这可能是海市蜃楼，它们可能存在于我们的脑海中
It could be a mirage. They could exist in our minds.

384
00:28:00,505 --> 00:28:02,439
你的意思是我们要疯了
You mean that we're going mad.

385
00:28:05,176 --> 00:28:09,408
或者某种力量正在我们的脑海中
Or some power is creating the illusion in our minds...

386
00:28:09,481 --> 00:28:12,450
制造我们离你们星球很近的错觉
that we are somewhere near your planet.

387
00:28:16,321 --> 00:28:18,255
但为什么？
But why?

388
00:28:19,293 --> 00:28:20,898
我不知道
I don't know.

389
00:28:23,019 --> 00:28:24,651
我不知道
I don't know!

390
00:28:32,904 --> 00:28:36,101
我想我知道是怎么回事了
I think I have an idea

391
00:28:36,174 --> 00:28:38,665
这样我们就不会一直试图找出我们在哪里
so that we won't keep trying to find out where we are:

392
00:28:38,743 --> 00:28:41,541
我们会满足于留在这里
that we'll be content to stay here!

393
00:28:41,613 --> 00:28:45,071
哦，知足！
Oh, be content!

394
00:28:46,584 --> 00:28:49,576
知足？
Be content?

395
00:28:49,654 --> 00:28:52,521
知足！
Be content!

396
00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:54,524
除非我发现我的船员发生了什么事
Not until I find out what happened to my crew.

397
00:28:54,592 --> 00:28:56,787
- 他们死了吗？  - 我不知道
- Are they dead? - I don't know.

398
00:28:56,861 --> 00:29:00,763
你杀了他们，这样你就可以将船占为己有了吗？
Did you kill them so you could have the ship to yourself?

399
00:29:00,832 --> 00:29:02,766
舰长…
Captain.

400
00:29:04,769 --> 00:29:07,067
舰长
Captain,

401
00:29:07,138 --> 00:29:09,868
我不对劲
something's happening to me.

402
00:29:09,941 --> 00:29:13,206
我以前从未有过这种感觉，
I never felt like this before.

403
00:29:13,278 --> 00:29:16,611
我以前也从未有过这种感觉
I've never felt like this before either.

404
00:29:16,681 --> 00:29:19,912
这是人们
Is this the way one looks...

405
00:29:19,984 --> 00:29:23,511
生病时的样子吗？
when one is developing a sickness?

406
00:29:26,715 --> 00:29:29,285
你的星球上没有疾病，记得吗？
There's no sickness on your planet, remember?

407
00:29:34,792 --> 00:29:38,228
现在会有了，会有疾病
Now there will be. There will be sickness.

408
00:29:40,605 --> 00:29:43,165
会有死亡
There will be death.

409
00:30:15,093 --> 00:30:17,459
[开门] 
[Door Opening] 

410
00:30:22,097 --> 00:30:24,725
- 霍丁  - 是的，柯克舰长
- Hodin! - Yes, Captain Kirk.

411
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:27,394
我们的实验已经通过了第一阶段
Our experiment has passed the first stage.

412
00:30:27,469 --> 00:30:30,529
让我进去，我可以帮她
Let me in there. I can help her.

413
00:30:30,606 --> 00:30:34,474
- 我们不需要你的药  - 但她病了
- We have no need of your medicines. - But she's ill!

414
00:30:34,543 --> 00:30:37,842
我们为她的病感谢你
And we're grateful to you for her illness.

415
00:30:37,913 --> 00:30:40,848
你做得很好，我的女儿
You have done well, my daughter.

416
00:30:48,577 --> 00:30:50,545
好好保护舰长，
Guard the captain well.

417
00:30:50,859 --> 00:30:53,851
我们将需要他很长时间
We shall need him for a long time.

418
00:31:09,748 --> 00:31:12,649
我深表同情，但星际舰队
I sympathize deeply, but Starfleet...

419
00:31:12,717 --> 00:31:15,151
不能无视联邦指令
cannot override Federation directives in this matter.

420
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:18,121
上将，船员们不会明白的
Admiral, the crew will not understand it.

421
00:31:18,189 --> 00:31:21,886
你的船员有兴趣挑起战争吗？
Has your crew suddenly become interested in provoking a war?

422
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,894
这不是星际舰队的使命
That is not Starfleet's mission.

423
00:31:24,151 --> 00:31:26,925
我们只想救舰长的命
We wish only to save the life of the captain.

424
00:31:27,116 --> 00:31:29,311
你没有就此事向联邦
You have not proved your case to the Federation,

425
00:31:29,311 --> 00:31:31,370
或星际舰队证明你的情况
or to Starfleet, for that matter.

426
00:31:31,447 --> 00:31:34,714
我确信我可以做到让您满意，上将
I am positive that I can do so to your satisfaction, Admiral.

427
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,576
从我第一次与大使交流，就一直确信
I have been convinced, since my first exchange with the ambassador,

428
00:31:38,957 --> 00:31:40,988
船长被俘虏了
that the captain has been taken prisoner.

429
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:42,771
已证明是事实，史波克先生，
Granted as fact, Mr. Spock.

430
00:31:43,033 --> 00:31:45,920
我现在知道他被关押在哪里了
I now know where the captain is being held,

431
00:31:45,994 --> 00:31:49,517
如果他被关押在我们传送他去的同一个地方
if he is being held at the same place to which we transported him.

432
00:31:49,779 --> 00:31:52,968
他们不会在议会厅伤害他
They would not dare harm him in the Gideon council chamber.

433
00:31:53,212 --> 00:31:57,670
长官，他没有被关押在议会厅，
Sir, the captain is not being held in the Gideon council chamber.

434
00:31:57,908 --> 00:32:01,818
- 他被关在附近  - 你回答了是什么和在哪里，
- He is being held nearby. - You have answered what and where.

435
00:32:02,077 --> 00:32:04,602
我在等你解释为什么
I'm waiting for your explanation of why.

436
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:07,410
因为，星球被我们的传感器屏蔽了
Since the planet is shielded from our sensors,

437
00:32:07,483 --> 00:32:10,884
如果不进行调查，我们就无法确定这一点
we cannot establish that without on-the-spot investigation.

438
00:32:10,953 --> 00:32:13,285
你有证据表明舰长的生命受到威胁吗？
Do you have evidence the captain's life is threatened?

439
00:32:16,592 --> 00:32:19,152
- 拒绝  - 上将
- Permission denied. - Admiral,

440
00:32:19,228 --> 00:32:22,857
我谨正式指出，你的决定是武断的
I wish to state for the record that your decision is arbitrary.

441
00:32:22,931 --> 00:32:24,865
以上
So noted.

442
00:32:30,272 --> 00:32:31,734
会持续很长时间吗？
Will it last long?

443
00:32:33,442 --> 00:32:37,674
这取决于感染者的实力
That depends on the strength of the one infected.

444
00:32:37,746 --> 00:32:40,647
你有很大的力量
You have great strength.

445
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:45,709
你怎么知道我什么时候死？
How will you know when I am to die?

446
00:32:45,787 --> 00:32:48,984
你的体温会很高
Your body temperature will be very great.

447
00:32:49,057 --> 00:32:52,584
你会看到我们，但你不会知道我们是谁
You will see us, but you will not know who we are.

448
00:32:52,661 --> 00:32:56,461
- 我必须在那之前见到他，父亲  - 休息，现在躺着别动
- I must see him before then, Father. - Rest. Now lie still.

449
00:33:02,538 --> 00:33:04,438
你感到巨大的痛苦吗？
Do you feel great pain?

450
00:33:04,506 --> 00:33:07,805
是的
Yes,

451
00:33:07,876 --> 00:33:10,902
我的手臂和大腿
in my arms and thighs.

452
00:33:10,979 --> 00:33:13,607
感到疼痛是什么感觉？
What is it like to feel pain?

453
00:33:15,286 --> 00:33:16,895
它就像是…
It is like...

454
00:33:19,621 --> 00:33:24,285
…就像当你看到人们对幸福没有希望时，父亲
like when you see the people have no hope for happiness, Father.

455
00:33:25,928 --> 00:33:28,863
你感到非常绝望
You feel great despair,

456
00:33:28,931 --> 00:33:30,990
你的心情很沉重，
and your heart is heavy,

457
00:33:31,066 --> 00:33:34,194
因为你知道你无能为力
because you know you can do nothing.

458
00:33:34,269 --> 00:33:36,203
痛苦就是这样
Pain is like that.

459
00:33:38,173 --> 00:33:40,971
你的勇气使我感到无比自豪
Your courage gives me great pride.

460
00:33:54,002 --> 00:33:55,715
- 让我看看她  - 还不行
- Let me see her. - Not yet.

461
00:33:56,955 --> 00:33:58,344
你不知道她可能有什么病
You don't know what she may have.

462
00:33:58,344 --> 00:34:01,924
但我们知道，她患有纯素脉络丛脑膜炎
But we do. She has Vegan-choriomeningitis.

463
00:34:03,145 --> 00:34:06,419
这是罕见且致命的，如果不在24小时内治疗，
That's very rare, and always fatal if not treated within 24 hours.

464
00:34:06,491 --> 00:34:07,860
我知道，它几乎要了我的命
I know. It almost killed me.

465
00:34:07,930 --> 00:34:11,307
是的，我们的总理在我们的谈判中了解到
Yes. Our prime minister learned about you during our negotiations.

466
00:34:11,378 --> 00:34:13,443
这就是我们带你来这里的原因
That's why we brought you here.

467
00:34:13,519 --> 00:34:17,730
你的血液提供了感染她的微生物
Your blood provided the micro organisms which infected her.

468
00:34:17,803 --> 00:34:19,743
我的手臂就是这样受伤的
That's how my arm got hurt.

469
00:34:19,811 --> 00:34:24,125
是的，正如奥多纳告诉你的，我们这里不需要医生
Yes, as Odona told you, we have no need for medical practitioners here.

470
00:34:24,196 --> 00:34:28,738
很抱歉，伤害了你使我们感到非常不安
Our apologies. We were unforgivably awkward to have hurt you.

471
00:34:42,484 --> 00:34:44,116
你疯了
You're mad.

472
00:34:44,191 --> 00:34:48,071
不，我们很绝望
No. We are desperate.

473
00:34:48,614 --> 00:34:50,092
我不明白
I don't understand...

474
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:54,770
星际舰队怎么能不允许我们传送下去寻找舰长
how Starfleet can deny permission to beam down to search for the captain.

475
00:34:54,842 --> 00:34:57,181
他们不求我们理解，医生
They did not ask for our understanding, Doctor.

476
00:34:57,251 --> 00:34:59,287
他们怎么能要求我们
I don't see how they expect us to sit here...

477
00:34:59,361 --> 00:35:00,970
坐等着船长再次出现呢？
and wait for the captain to reappear.

478
00:35:01,044 --> 00:35:04,496
不幸的是，我必须违反星际舰队的直接命令
Unfortunately, I must violate a direct order from Starfleet.

479
00:35:04,573 --> 00:35:07,070
这是最好的决定，史波克，我和你一起
That's the best possible decision you could make, Spock. I'm with you.

480
00:35:07,147 --> 00:35:09,059
我不会掉以轻心，医生
I do not make it lightly, Doctor.

481
00:35:09,126 --> 00:35:11,792
然而，指挥部知道霍丁大使
However, Command knows that Ambassador Hodin...

482
00:35:11,864 --> 00:35:14,203
一直没有对我们说实话
has not been totally honest with us.

483
00:35:14,272 --> 00:35:19,209
乌乎拉上尉，重复原始吉迪恩坐标用以传送
Lieutenant Uhura, repeat original Gideon coordinates for beam down.

484
00:35:19,286 --> 00:35:23,763
875，020，079
875, 020, 079.

485
00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:26,144
斯科特先生，给你的坐标呢？
Mr. Scott, coordinates given you?

486
00:35:26,213 --> 00:35:30,228
875，020，709
875, 020, 709.

487
00:35:30,303 --> 00:35:33,261
坐标不匹配
Coordinates don't match.

488
00:35:33,338 --> 00:35:37,848
正是，我会立刻传送下去，斯科特先生，你来掌舵
Precisely. I shall beam down at once. Mr. Scott, you have the con.

489
00:35:37,923 --> 00:35:40,386
我去哪我的医疗三录仪，在传送室和你见面
I'll pick up my medical tricorder, meet you in the transporter room.

490
00:35:40,463 --> 00:35:42,701
不行，医生，我不能承担
Negative, Doctor. I cannot accept the responsibility...

491
00:35:42,772 --> 00:35:46,170
命令官员违反指令的责任
for ordering a fellow officer to violate a Starfleet directive.

492
00:35:46,237 --> 00:35:48,768
我只能为自己做决定
I can make such a decision only for myself.

493
00:35:48,842 --> 00:35:51,373
我不是要你替我做决定
I'm not asking you to make the decision for me.

494
00:35:51,447 --> 00:35:54,507
形势迫使我这样做，医生
The situation forces me to do so, Doctor.

495
00:35:54,770 --> 00:35:57,910
在这种情况下，这是你能做出的最糟糕的决定
In that case, it's the worst possible decision you can make.

496
00:35:58,649 --> 00:36:00,679
这不会花很长时间
This will not take long.

497
00:36:05,610 --> 00:36:10,356
这不就是柯克舰长离开前说的话吗？
Isn't that just about what Captain Kirk said before he left?

498
00:36:31,341 --> 00:36:33,511
柯克舰长
Captain Kirk.

499
00:36:33,511 --> 00:36:35,413
我是史波克，柯克舰长？
Spock here. Captain Kirk!

500
00:36:46,416 --> 00:36:49,284
[仪器嗡嗡声] 
[ Instrument Humming ] 

501
00:37:03,602 --> 00:37:06,701
你给联邦的报告是一堆谎言
Your report to the Federation was a tissue of lies.

502
00:37:06,777 --> 00:37:12,456
你把吉迪恩的环境，物理，文化条件
You described environmental, physical, cultural conditions...

503
00:37:12,456 --> 00:37:14,360
- 描述得像天堂一样  - 本来确实如此，
- that would make Gideon a paradise. - And so it was!

504
00:37:14,431 --> 00:37:19,137
很久以前，我们所描述的都是真实的
A long, long time ago what we described was true!

505
00:37:19,209 --> 00:37:22,913
吉迪恩的大气一直是无菌的
The atmosphere on Gideon has always been germfree.

506
00:37:22,986 --> 00:37:28,091
人们在身体和精神上的完美中茁壮成长
And the people flourished in their physical and spiritual perfection.

507
00:37:28,167 --> 00:37:32,007
最终，甚至寿命也增加了
Eventually, even the life span increased.

508
00:37:32,078 --> 00:37:36,818
死亡对我们来说几乎是陌生的
Death became almost unknown to us.

509
00:37:36,890 --> 00:37:41,028
只有当身体不再能够自我再生时才会发生
It occurred only when the body could no longer regenerate itself.

510
00:37:41,102 --> 00:37:44,908
现在这种情况只发生在非常老的人身上
And that happens now only to the very old.

511
00:37:44,979 --> 00:37:47,919
这是大多数人都会羡慕的条件
Those are conditions most people would envy.

512
00:37:47,987 --> 00:37:50,724
但吉迪恩人并不觉得它令人羡慕
But Gideon did not find it enviable.

513
00:37:51,047 --> 00:37:55,104
出生率持续上升，人口增长
The birth rate continued to rise, and the population grew,

514
00:37:55,172 --> 00:37:59,412
直到现在，吉迪恩被包裹在一团生命物质中…
until now Gideon is encased in a living mass...

515
00:37:59,485 --> 00:38:03,930
我们不能休息，没有平安，没有喜乐
who can find no rest, no peace, no joy.

516
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:08,132
你为什么不引进
Then why haven't you introduced...

517
00:38:08,207 --> 00:38:11,649
男性和女性绝育的新技术？
any of the new techniques to sterilize men and women?

518
00:38:11,717 --> 00:38:15,660
每个器官都会自我更新，这是不可能的
Every organ renews itself. It would be impossible.

519
00:38:15,728 --> 00:38:19,728
那让你的人民了解避孕工具
Then let your people learn about the devices to prevent conception.

520
00:38:19,806 --> 00:38:22,176
联邦将提供你们所需要的一切
The Federation will provide anything you need.

521
00:38:22,245 --> 00:38:27,157
但你明白，吉迪恩人一直相信
But you see, the people of Gideon have always believed...

522
00:38:27,226 --> 00:38:31,225
生命是神圣的
that life is sacred,

523
00:38:31,304 --> 00:38:33,707
对生命的热爱
that the love of life...

524
00:38:33,776 --> 00:38:36,807
是最好的礼物
is the greatest gift.

525
00:38:36,885 --> 00:38:41,454
这是吉迪恩人不可动摇的真理
That is the one unshakable truth of Gideon.

526
00:38:41,530 --> 00:38:44,562
这种压倒性的对生命的热爱
And this overwhelming love of life...

527
00:38:44,638 --> 00:38:48,844
导致了我们的再生能力
has developed our regenerative capacity...

528
00:38:48,917 --> 00:38:50,946
和我们的长寿
and our great longevity.

529
00:38:51,022 --> 00:38:53,861
还有你现在面临的巨大苦难
And the great misery which you now face.

530
00:38:53,930 --> 00:38:56,300
令人痛苦的事实，舰长
That is bitterly true, Captain.

531
00:38:56,370 --> 00:39:01,007
然而，我们不能否认塑造我们进化的真相
Nevertheless, we cannot deny the truth which shaped our evolution.

532
00:39:01,083 --> 00:39:04,525
我们无权干涉
We are incapable of destroying or interfering with...

533
00:39:04,592 --> 00:39:09,629
我们深爱的事物的创造
the creation of that which we love so deeply life...

534
00:39:09,706 --> 00:39:13,979
从胎儿到发育的生命，各种形式的生命
in every form, from fetus to developed being.

535
00:39:14,051 --> 00:39:18,688
它违背了我们的传统，违背了我们的本性
It is against our tradition, against our very nature.

536
00:39:20,268 --> 00:39:22,262
我们根本做不到
We simply could not do it.

537
00:39:22,341 --> 00:39:24,369
然而你可以杀死一个年轻的女孩
Yet you can kill a young girl!

538
00:39:24,445 --> 00:39:29,323
我们正试图重新调整整个文明的生命周期
We're trying to readjust the life cycle of an entire civilization.

539
00:39:29,392 --> 00:39:31,454
你在杀死你自己的女儿！
You're killing your own daughter!

540
00:39:31,532 --> 00:39:35,600
我女儿希望让你感受到吉迪恩人的痛苦
My daughter hoped to make you feel the agony of Gideon.

541
00:39:35,676 --> 00:39:37,909
但这是不可能的
But it was impossible.

542
00:39:37,981 --> 00:39:42,084
没有陌生人可以意识到
No stranger could realize...

543
00:39:42,159 --> 00:39:44,997
在这里生命有多恐怖
the horror that life can be here.

544
00:39:45,067 --> 00:39:48,509
我不会乞求你理解我的悲伤
I will not beg for your understanding of my personal grief,

545
00:39:48,578 --> 00:39:52,520
也不会为了获得你的合作​​而夸大它
nor will I parade it for you to gain your cooperation.

546
00:39:52,588 --> 00:39:55,186
我对女儿的爱
My love for my daughter...

547
00:39:55,261 --> 00:39:58,258
太深了，无法表达
is too deep for display.

548
00:39:58,336 --> 00:40:00,467
我对她的骄傲甚至更深
My pride in her runs even deeper.

549
00:40:00,542 --> 00:40:04,541
我女儿自由地选择做她正在做的事情
My daughter freely chose to do what she is doing,

550
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:08,393
正如吉迪恩人可以自由选择
as the people of Gideon are free to choose.

551
00:40:10,837 --> 00:40:14,837
你需要的病毒非常罕见，
The virus you need is very rare.

552
00:40:14,915 --> 00:40:16,114
谁来提供？
Who will provide it?

553
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:23,324
你会留下来，你的血液会提供它
You will stay. Your blood will provide it.

554
00:40:23,403 --> 00:40:25,341
不，先生，不是我，
Oh, no, sir, not me.

555
00:40:25,409 --> 00:40:28,281
你有很多方法可用 我只提到了几个，
You have many methods available. I've mentioned only a few.

556
00:40:30,021 --> 00:40:34,124
我不会为此目的献出我的生命，我有很多计划，
I do not offer my life for this purpose. I have many plans.

557
00:40:34,199 --> 00:40:38,575
我对奥多纳抱有希望，不是死亡
And I have hopes other than death for Odona.

558
00:40:38,645 --> 00:40:42,051
我女儿恳求你留下来
My daughter pleaded with you to stay.

559
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:44,319
我们之间所说的
What was said...

560
00:40:44,393 --> 00:40:47,664
和发生的一切都别让人知道
and what happened between us was for us alone.

561
00:40:47,735 --> 00:40:52,443
她希望你会爱她并想要留下来
She hoped you would love her and wish to stay.

562
00:40:52,515 --> 00:40:54,988
所以这就是你的计划
So that was your plan

563
00:40:55,055 --> 00:40:58,759
我会被她的魔咒所迷惑
that I would fall so under her spell...

564
00:40:58,831 --> 00:41:01,269
我会放弃我的自由，
that I would give up my freedom...

565
00:41:01,338 --> 00:41:05,372
成为一个自愿的牺牲品
and become a willing sacrifice.

566
00:41:05,449 --> 00:41:08,822
和我们在一起，我们很绝望
Stay with us. We're desperate.

567
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:14,796
[哔哔] 
[Communicator Beeps] 

568
00:41:17,983 --> 00:41:19,920
奥多纳的体温在上升，
Odona's fever is rising.

569
00:41:21,626 --> 00:41:24,532
她在呼唤詹姆斯·柯克的名字
She's calling the name of James Kirk.

570
00:41:27,409 --> 00:41:30,280
你看，你现在不能离开我们
You see, you cannot leave us now.

571
00:41:33,358 --> 00:41:35,295
去找她
Go to her.

572
00:42:06,615 --> 00:42:09,680
企业号的
Exact duplicate...

573
00:42:09,752 --> 00:42:12,144
精确复制品
of the Enterprise.

574
00:42:19,924 --> 00:42:23,309
但完全无法运行
But completely inoperative.

575
00:42:39,332 --> 00:42:42,449
史波克呼叫企业号，史波克呼叫企业号
Spock to Enterprise. Spock to Enterprise.

576
00:42:43,195 --> 00:42:44,739
我是斯科特，史波克先生
Scott here, Mr. Spock.

577
00:42:44,739 --> 00:42:47,805
我在企业号的舰桥上和你通话
I am speaking to you from the bridge of the Enterprise.

578
00:42:49,811 --> 00:42:51,200
你在哪儿？
You're where?

579
00:42:51,267 --> 00:42:54,530
在企业号的舰桥上，斯科特先生
On the bridge of the Enterprise, Mr. Scott.

580
00:42:54,596 --> 00:42:57,564
那些是你强调的坐标
Those were the coordinates you insisted on.

581
00:42:57,637 --> 00:42:59,513
它们是对的，
And they were correct.

582
00:42:59,578 --> 00:43:03,481
我在企业号的精确复制品上
I am on board an exact duplicate of the Enterprise.

583
00:43:04,203 --> 00:43:07,074
企业号的精确复制品？
An exact duplicate of the Enterprise?

584
00:43:07,147 --> 00:43:09,076
它在轨道上吗，史波克先生？
Is it in orbit, Mr. Spock?

585
00:43:09,152 --> 00:43:11,181
在轨道上，医生？
In orbit, Doctor?

586
00:43:12,134 --> 00:43:13,129
从某种意义上说，
In a manner of speaking.

587
00:43:14,098 --> 00:43:18,051
吉迪恩在轨道上，而飞船在吉迪恩上
Gideon is in orbit, and the ship is on Gideon.

588
00:43:18,548 --> 00:43:22,078
一个好的开始，舰长呢？
Well, that's a beginning, but what about the captain?

589
00:43:22,250 --> 00:43:24,180
我确定他在某个地方，
I'm sure he's on board somewhere.

590
00:43:24,255 --> 00:43:28,191
我在收集生命读数，通话完毕
I'm picking up life readings. Spock out.

591
00:43:28,923 --> 00:43:32,539
[史波克] ：舰船日志，星历5423.8，
[ Spock's Voice ] Ship's Log: Star date 5423.8.

592
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:34,837
史波克大副报告
First Officer Spock reporting.

593
00:43:34,907 --> 00:43:37,387
很明显，吉迪恩人将柯克舰长传送到了
Obviously the Gideon's have transported Captain Kirk...

594
00:43:37,462 --> 00:43:41,597
企业号的复制品上，迷惑他的头脑，
onto this replica of the Enterprise to so confuse his mind...

595
00:43:41,666 --> 00:43:45,350
使他容易受到一些实验的影响
as to make him susceptible to some extraordinary experiment.

596
00:43:45,418 --> 00:43:48,551
我的目的是找到舰长
It is my intention to locate the captain and warn him...

597
00:43:48,621 --> 00:43:52,921
并在实验结束前警告他，逻辑表明
before the experiment reaches its conclusion, which logic indicates...

598
00:43:52,987 --> 00:43:56,956
一旦舰长知道，就意味着他生命的终结
means the end of the captain's life as he knows it.

599
00:43:57,029 --> 00:44:00,680
[呻吟] 
[ Moaning ] 

600
00:44:05,682 --> 00:44:08,522
请允许我把麦考伊医生带下来，
If you don't allow me to bring Dr. McCoy down here,

601
00:44:08,588 --> 00:44:10,972
否则来不及给她做任何治疗了
it'll soon be too late to do anything for her.

602
00:44:11,046 --> 00:44:13,853
我们已经告诉过你，她和我的愿望是
We have told you, it is her wish and mine...

603
00:44:13,919 --> 00:44:16,761
不要干扰病毒的自然过程
that there be no interference with the natural progress of the virus.

604
00:44:16,825 --> 00:44:18,706
她的死是不必要的
Her death is unnecessary.

605
00:44:18,772 --> 00:44:20,677
如果她活着，她的血液将提供
Even if she lives, her blood will provide...

606
00:44:20,751 --> 00:44:22,786
你需要的与我相同的血清
the same serum you need as mine would.

607
00:44:22,858 --> 00:44:26,712
不，她的英年早逝
No. Her death at so young an age...

608
00:44:26,785 --> 00:44:30,966
能让人们相信我们的生命周期是可以改变的
will let the people know for certain that our life cycle can be changed.

609
00:44:31,032 --> 00:44:35,212
这个象征将培养出敬业的年轻志愿者
It's the symbol that'll bring forth the dedicated young volunteers.

610
00:44:35,569 --> 00:44:40,491
他们新血液中的血清会改变吉迪恩
The serum in their new blood will change Gideon,

611
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:43,649
它将再次成为曾经的天堂
and it will, once more, be the paradise it was.

612
00:44:43,649 --> 00:44:44,668
[呻吟] 
[Moaning] 

613
00:45:07,011 --> 00:45:09,820
我很高兴你在这里
I'm glad that you are here.

614
00:45:11,270 --> 00:45:13,121
我的时间还多吗？
Is the time short?

615
00:45:14,833 --> 00:45:18,021
不多了
Very short.

616
00:45:18,877 --> 00:45:22,578
我请求你让我们的旅程永远持续下去
And I asked you to make our journey last forever.

617
00:45:25,590 --> 00:45:29,323
它在这里开始
Oh. It began here.

618
00:45:31,256 --> 00:45:34,343
它可以继续
And it can continue.

619
00:45:34,417 --> 00:45:37,136
只要你允许，
If only you'll allow me,

620
00:45:37,219 --> 00:45:40,084
我就能治愈你
I can cure you.

621
00:45:41,172 --> 00:45:44,003
我不害怕会发生的事
I'm not afraid of what will happen.

622
00:45:44,084 --> 00:45:47,070
只是现在…
It is just that now...

623
00:45:47,369 --> 00:45:52,245
我全心全意地想永远和你在一起
I wish with all my heart to stay with you forever.

624
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:35,678
阁下，
Your Excellency.

625
00:46:35,923 --> 00:46:39,752
舰长，你看起来不错，星际舰队的分析是正确的
Captain, you're looking well. Starfleet's analysis was correct.

626
00:46:39,752 --> 00:46:43,630
史波克先生，我们有个病人给麦考伊医生，让斯科提传送我们上去
Mr. Spock, we have a patient for Dr. McCoy. Have Scotty beam us up.

627
00:46:45,324 --> 00:46:48,523
史波克呼叫企业号，史波克呼叫企业号
Spock to Enterprise. Spock to Enterprise.

628
00:46:48,915 --> 00:46:51,975
- 我是斯科特  - 三个人要传送，斯科特先生
- Scott here. - Three to beam up, Mr. Scott.

629
00:46:52,051 --> 00:46:53,824
- 相同的坐标？- 不是，
- Same coordinates? - Negative.

630
00:46:53,824 --> 00:46:57,317
锁定我的通讯器信号
Lock in on my communicator signal.

631
00:46:58,473 --> 00:47:02,326
阁下，请不要干涉
Your Excellency, please do not interfere.

632
00:47:02,326 --> 00:47:06,796
我已经有了一个需要与高层解决的严重问题
I already have one serious problem to resolve with upper echelons.

633
00:47:26,737 --> 00:47:30,610
嗯，真险，但你挺过来了
Well, it was close, but you made it.

634
00:47:30,678 --> 00:47:32,433
我痊愈了？
I am cured?

635
00:47:32,433 --> 00:47:35,049
对，就像舰长一样
Right, just like the captain.

636
00:47:39,499 --> 00:47:42,732
你应该愤怒地大喊，而不是微笑
Instead of smiling at me, you should be shouting in anger.

637
00:47:42,807 --> 00:47:45,004
为什么，因为你又好了？
Why? Because you're well again?

638
00:47:45,809 --> 00:47:49,644
不，因为我假装…
No. Because I pretended to be

639
00:47:52,493 --> 00:47:56,126
你怎么还能忍受看我，在我那样骗你之后？
How can you bear to look at me after the way I deceived you?

640
00:47:56,201 --> 00:48:00,837
至少你欠我让我看你的特权
At least you owe me the privilege of letting me look at you.

641
00:48:06,857 --> 00:48:09,225
你真是个绅士，柯克舰长
You are a gentleman, Captain Kirk.

642
00:48:09,296 --> 00:48:11,925
谢谢你，女士
Thank you, ma'am.

643
00:48:12,002 --> 00:48:14,130
吉迪恩不再需要你了，
You are no longer needed on Gideon.

644
00:48:14,206 --> 00:48:16,904
我可以代替你在那里
I can take your place there.

645
00:48:18,726 --> 00:48:20,419
这是你想做的吗？
Is that what you wanted?

646
00:48:23,325 --> 00:48:25,819
那是我必须做的
That is what I must do.

647
00:48:25,897 --> 00:48:27,891
现在那里需要我
I am needed there now.

648
00:48:32,971 --> 00:48:36,000
到处都需要你，奥多纳
You're needed everywhere, Odona.

649
00:48:48,779 --> 00:48:50,694
它不像我们的船
It is not like our ship.

650
00:48:50,762 --> 00:48:53,433
哦，不，完全一样，只是这艘能飞
Oh, yes, it is. It's exactly the same. Only this one works.

651
00:48:53,504 --> 00:48:55,421
它去过许多其他星球？
It goes to many other planets?

652
00:48:55,488 --> 00:48:59,906
是的，整个银河系，还有一个区别，
Yes, it goes to the whole galaxy, with another difference

653
00:48:59,982 --> 00:49:02,227
这艘有很多人
this one is crowded.

654
00:49:02,297 --> 00:49:05,465
对你来说似乎很拥挤？
It seems crowded to you?

655
00:49:05,537 --> 00:49:07,946
现在确实如此
It does now.

656
00:49:09,735 --> 00:49:13,159
你要留在船上吗？
Are you going to stay on the ship?

657
00:49:13,236 --> 00:49:16,143
是的，奥多纳，我必须这样做
Yes, Odona, I have to.

658
00:49:17,798 --> 00:49:20,264
尽管我的星球如此拥挤，
As crowded as my planet is,

659
00:49:20,344 --> 00:49:24,998
但我希望它能再容纳一个人
I could wish for it to hold one more person.

660
00:49:28,242 --> 00:49:33,134
柯克呼叫传送控制，传送一个人到吉迪恩星球
Kirk to transporter control. One to beam down to the planet Gideon.

661
00:49:36,143 --> 00:49:38,982
我会想念你的，詹姆斯·柯克舰长
I will miss you, Captain James Kirk.
