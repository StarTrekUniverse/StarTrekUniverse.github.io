这只是些零碎的东西，不完整

00:08:14,014 --> 00:08:17,893
也许梅尔克特人没有足够的关于这个时代的数据

00:13:14,314 --> 00:13:16,900
摩根·厄普
Morgan Earp.

140
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:35,377
既然我们已经看到死亡是这种情况下的一个现实
Since we have seen that death is the one reality in this situation,

141
00:13:35,544 --> 00:13:38,630
我郑重建议你重新找个位置
I seriously suggest you reseat yourself.

142
00:13:38,797 --> 00:13:41,842
两只手都不要动
Without moving a muscle of either hand.

143
00:13:42,134 --> 00:13:47,639
否则将使你卷入所谓的“快速拔枪”
That would involve you in what was called "the fast draw".

144
00:13:47,806 --> 00:13:51,977
它引发了不幸的事件
It initiated unfortunate events.

145
00:13:59,276 --> 00:14:03,697
- 你们要和平常一样的吗？  - 是的，半加仑苏格兰威士忌
- You boys want your usual? - Yes. A half a gallon of Scotch.

146
00:14:03,864 --> 00:14:07,409
你知道我们只有波旁威士忌，或玉米威士忌
You know we only got bourbon. Or corn whiskey.

147
00:14:07,576 --> 00:14:11,705
我希望一切都结束了，我今天早上看到维吉尔在外面巡逻
I wish it was all over. I saw Virgil out patrolling this morning.

148
00:14:12,956 --> 00:14:15,042
我们总是可以指望维吉尔
We can always count on Virgil.

149
00:14:15,209 --> 00:14:18,879
他们一直吹嘘要把克兰顿兄弟赶出去
They've been boasting about chasing the Clantons out.

150
00:14:19,046 --> 00:14:21,882
我猜你现在要给他们点颜色看看，是吗？
I guess you'll show them now, won't you?

151
00:14:23,467 --> 00:14:26,178
我认为我们没有任何选择
I don't think we're going to have any choice.

152
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:32,309
- 别让这个人渣玷污了你  - 别碰她！
- You'll dirty yourself with this scum. - Get your hands off her!

153
00:14:32,476 --> 00:14:36,438
好吧，我们不想惹任何麻烦
All right. We don't want any trouble.

154
00:14:36,605 --> 00:14:42,069
- 那你来我的镇上做什么？  - 别烦我们，厄普先生
- Then what are you doing in my town? - Just leave us alone, Mr. Earp.

155
00:14:43,362 --> 00:14:48,158
你们五个，你们希望我拔枪，不是吗？好的，我会的
Five of you. You'd like me to draw, wouldn't you? All right. I will.

156
00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:52,538
很快
Soon enough.

157
00:14:55,123 --> 00:14:57,376
很快
Soon enough.

158
00:15:10,097 --> 00:15:15,018
我相信他实际上是想挑起与契科夫先生的争端
I believe he was actually trying to provoke a dispute with Mr. Chekov.

159
00:15:17,271 --> 00:15:20,524
真险，艾克，幸好他们不是两个人
Close, Ike. Lucky there wasn't two of them.

160
00:15:20,691 --> 00:15:22,943
大概吧
I guess so.

161
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:27,739
西尔维亚说得对，他们一直在恶语相向
Sylvia's right. They've been badmouthing something fierce.

162
00:15:27,906 --> 00:15:29,992
你们看着点
You boys watch it.

163
00:15:30,158 --> 00:15:35,914
我们会盯着的，密切观察一切
We shall watch it, and everything, extremely closely.

164
00:15:37,541 --> 00:15:40,335
比利，你真好
Billy, you were wonderful.

165
00:15:47,718 --> 00:15:50,596
呃……契科夫先生？
Um... Mr. Chekov?

166
00:15:52,973 --> 00:15:59,479
你知道我们总是应该与当地人保持良好的关系
You know we're always supposed to maintain good relations with natives.

167
00:16:01,732 --> 00:16:04,359
小姐...
Young lady...

168
00:16:06,945 --> 00:16:09,656
小姐...- 是的，艾克
- Young lady... - Yes, Ike.

169
00:16:09,823 --> 00:16:14,494
如果你不介意的话，我想单独和先生...比利谈谈
I'd like to talk to Mr... to Billy alone if you don't mind.

170
00:16:14,661 --> 00:16:17,748
好的，我明白
All right. I understand.

171
00:16:17,914 --> 00:16:20,500
比利·克莱伯恩，你要小心
Billy Claiborne, you be careful.

172
00:16:23,128 --> 00:16:26,548
契科夫先生，你要小心
Mr. Chekov, you be careful.

173
00:16:26,715 --> 00:16:31,762
史波克先生，除了我们的手枪，我们没有改变
Mr. Spock, except for our handguns, we haven't changed.

174
00:16:31,928 --> 00:16:37,267
- 还有他们将我们视为克兰顿兄弟  - 我不认为那是件坏事
- Yet they see us as the Clantons. - I don't think that's such a bad thing.

175
00:16:37,434 --> 00:16:40,479
- 时间还早  - 我们知道什么？
- The day is still young. - What have we got?

176
00:16:40,646 --> 00:16:45,984
我们在1881年10月26日的亚利桑那州的墓碑镇
We're in Tombstone, Arizona, October 26th, 1881.

177
00:16:47,402 --> 00:16:52,074
OK畜栏枪战那天，而我们是克兰顿兄弟
The day of the gunfight at OK Corral. And we're the Clantons.

178
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:55,285
摩根·厄普去告诉他的兄弟们我们在这儿
Morgan Earp is telling his brothers we're here.

179
00:16:55,452 --> 00:16:58,705
如果这是某种历史重演
And if this is some sort of a replay of history,

180
00:16:58,872 --> 00:17:06,171
厄普兄弟将在今天下午5:00在OK畜栏杀死克兰顿兄弟
the Earps will kill the Clantons at the OK Corral at 5:00 this afternoon.

181
00:17:09,174 --> 00:17:13,553
今天下午5:00我们不要去OK畜栏
We're not going to be at the OK Corral at 5:00 this afternoon.

182
00:17:13,845 --> 00:17:19,267
你，酒保，埃德，你呃…你说你认识我们
You. Bartender. Ed. You er... you claim you know us.

183
00:17:19,434 --> 00:17:22,771
我没有夸大其词，就这么发生了
I ain't making no big claims. It just so happens.

184
00:17:22,938 --> 00:17:26,441
- 仔细看看我  - 是的
- Take a close look at me. - Yeah.

185
00:17:26,608 --> 00:17:30,320
- 你觉得我是谁？  - 艾克·克兰顿，你认为是谁？
- Who do you think I am? - Ike Clanton. Who do you think?

186
00:17:30,487 --> 00:17:36,618
我知道这难以理解，但我是詹姆斯·T·柯克舰长
I know this is hard to understand, but I'm Captain James T. Kirk.

187
00:17:36,785 --> 00:17:41,164
这些人是我的船员，我们不是真的在这里，我们来自未来
These men are my crew. We're not really here. We're from the future.

188
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,752
我们还没有出生
We haven't been born yet.

189
00:17:50,215 --> 00:17:52,718
摸摸我衬衫的布料
Feel the material in my shirt.

190
00:17:52,884 --> 00:17:55,721
现在摸摸你衬衫的布料
Now feel the material in your own shirt.

191
00:17:57,472 --> 00:18:00,183
你注意到有什么不同吗？
Do you notice any difference?

192
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:02,227
没有
No.

193
00:18:03,228 --> 00:18:07,065
- 这些衣服看起来和你的像吗？  - 不完全像
- Do these clothes look like yours? - Not exactly.

194
00:18:07,232 --> 00:18:12,237
- 你见过这样的衣服吗？  - 当然，在克兰顿家的人身上
- Have you ever seen clothes like this? - Sure. On the Clantons.

195
00:18:12,404 --> 00:18:16,032
- 你们克兰顿家的人很会开玩笑  - 我不是在开玩笑
- You Clantons are great with jokes. - I'm not joking.

196
00:18:16,283 --> 00:18:18,785
厄普家的人从不开玩笑
The Earps never joke.

197
00:18:18,952 --> 00:18:22,956
我不是在开玩笑！我不是艾克·克兰顿！
I'm not joking! I'm not Ike Clanton!

198
00:18:23,123 --> 00:18:27,419
随你怎么说，艾克，我认为你是谁并不重要
Anything you say, Ike. Don't matter who I think you are.

199
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:31,465
你的问题是，怀亚特·厄普认为你是谁？
Your problem is, who does Wyatt Earp think you are?

200
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:42,976
早上好，我是詹姆斯·柯克，这里有个误会
Good morning. I'm James Kirk. There's been a misunderstanding.

201
00:18:43,143 --> 00:18:45,812
我不知道你想耍什么花招，
I don't know what you're trying to pull,

202
00:18:45,979 --> 00:18:50,358
但我们警告过你别再在镇上露出你的丑恶嘴脸了
but we warned you not to show your ugly face in town again.

203
00:18:53,153 --> 00:18:58,158
- 我想和你谈谈这个  - 我们谈完了，克兰顿
- I wanted to talk to you about that. - We're done talking, Clanton.

204
00:18:58,325 --> 00:19:03,455
- 但这里有个误会，我...- 再给你一次机会，最后一次
- But there's been a mistake. I... - One more chance. Your last.

205
00:19:03,622 --> 00:19:08,919
你必须在今晚5:00之前让你的偷马队出城
You've got until 5:00 tonight to get your horse-stealing crew out of town.

206
00:19:11,171 --> 00:19:14,299
沿着路一直走
All the way.

207
00:19:14,466 --> 00:19:20,639
- 是的，我们不想打架  - 我一直说你胆小
- Yes. We don't want a fight. - I always said you was yellow.

208
00:19:23,892 --> 00:19:26,895
我想再次试着使你理解
I'll make one more attempt to get through to you.

209
00:19:27,062 --> 00:19:29,272
我不叫克兰顿，我叫柯克
My name is not Clanton. It's Kirk.

210
00:19:29,439 --> 00:19:33,944
- 我们听到了你的笑话  - 我不是在开玩笑
- We heard the talk about your jokes. - I'm not joking.

211
00:19:35,529 --> 00:19:40,283
当然，好吧，很高兴见到你，柯克先生
Sure. Well, I'm glad to meet you, Mr. Kirk.

212
00:19:48,583 --> 00:19:51,586
- 拔枪，克兰顿  - 不是我，厄普先生
- Draw, Clanton. - Not me, Mr. Earp.

213
00:19:51,753 --> 00:19:55,841
- 不是你你拔枪就是我拔枪  - 不，怀亚特
- You draw or I will. - No, Wyatt.

214
00:19:56,842 --> 00:20:04,099
让我来，时机一到，我会让他付出代价
Let me. When the time comes, I'll pay him for this.

215
00:20:09,271 --> 00:20:12,274
我们不想有任何麻烦，我们会合作的
We don't want any trouble. We'll cooperate.

216
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:15,026
5:00，克兰顿，明白了吗？
5:00, Clanton. Is that clear?

217
00:20:16,444 --> 00:20:22,951
如果你在5:01在城里，我们会杀了你们每个人，不管你拔不拔枪
If you're in town at 5:01, we'll kill every one of you whether you draw or not.

218
00:20:24,786 --> 00:20:26,496
明白了吗？
Is that clear?

219
00:20:41,761 --> 00:20:45,640
- 怎么了？  - 他们怎么称呼那种东西？火？
- What's the matter? - What do they call that stuff? Fire?

220
00:20:45,807 --> 00:20:50,186
陶斯闪电，试试看，它被认为是药用的
Taos Lightning. Try some. It was considered medicinal.

221
00:20:50,353 --> 00:20:53,648
他们应该给它贴上标签，“仅供外用”
They ought to label it, "For external use only."

222
00:20:53,815 --> 00:20:59,321
需要一点时间适应，事实上，人会慢慢喜欢上它
It just takes a bit of getting used to. Actually, a man could grow fond of it.

223
00:20:59,487 --> 00:21:02,574
我不愿去想它对你的胃有什么影响。
I hate to think what it's doing to your stomach.

224
00:21:02,741 --> 00:21:06,286
还有你的反应速度，从现在开始，我们需要快速反应
And your reflexes. We'll need fast reflexes from now on.

225
00:21:06,453 --> 00:21:11,416
- 没有与厄普兄弟谈判  - 是的，要是我们有一把相位枪
- There's no negotiating with the Earps. - Aye. If we only had a phaser.

226
00:21:11,583 --> 00:21:13,251
或者通讯器
Or a communicator.

227
00:21:13,543 --> 00:21:18,882
当我们被传送回船上时，看厄普兄弟的反应会很有趣
It would be a pleasure to watch those Earps as we beamed back to the ship.

228
00:21:19,049 --> 00:21:21,551
- 我们可以做一个吗？  - 不可能的
- Could we make one? - Impossible.

229
00:21:21,843 --> 00:21:26,306
没有金属合金或能源来制造我们的设备
There are no metal alloys or power sources to make our devices.

230
00:21:26,473 --> 00:21:30,352
我们得要寻找同时代的解决方案
We're going to have to seek contemporary solutions.

231
00:21:30,518 --> 00:21:34,481
- 契科夫呢？-契科夫先生在恋爱
- Where's Chekov? - Mr. Chekov is involved.

232
00:21:34,648 --> 00:21:37,192
你不应该回镇里
You shouldn't have come back to town.

233
00:21:37,484 --> 00:21:40,654
摩根会杀了你，因为他想要得到我
Morgan will kill you because he wants me.

234
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:42,739
用他过时的武器？
With his outdated weapon?

235
00:21:42,906 --> 00:21:46,743
如果他向我开枪，我让开就行了
If he shoots at me, I'll just step out of the way.

236
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:52,165
你可以拿它开玩笑，我见过他们的行动，尤其是摩根
You can joke about it. I've seen them in action. Especially Morgan.

237
00:21:52,332 --> 00:21:56,753
很多人和事都试图杀死我，你会惊讶的
A lot of people and things have tried to kill me. You'd be surprised.

238
00:21:56,920 --> 00:22:00,423
契科夫先生……我是说比利，来吧
Mr. Chekov... I mean Billy. Come along.

239
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:03,051
是的，长官
Yes, sir.

240
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:06,137
比利？
Billy?

241
00:22:06,304 --> 00:22:08,640
拜托，不要靠近他
Please. Don't even go near him.

242
00:22:08,807 --> 00:22:10,976
先生们
Gentlemen.

243
00:22:16,564 --> 00:22:20,610
- 我们去哪？  - 锻炼一下勇气
- Where are we going? - To exercise the better part of valor.

244
00:22:41,673 --> 00:22:45,176
问题解决了，一个力场
That settles that. A force field.

245
00:22:45,468 --> 00:22:47,220
[钟声]
[CLOCK CHIMES]

246
00:22:51,433 --> 00:22:55,603
梅尔克特人不会允许我们离开这个城镇
The Melkotians are not going to permit us to leave this town.

247
00:22:55,895 --> 00:22:59,107
- 如果我们能和飞船取得联系就好了  - 但它在哪儿？
- If we could only contact the ship. - But where is it?

248
00:22:59,274 --> 00:23:02,318
如果是你在操控，你会做什么？
If you were in charge of it, what would you be doing?

249
00:23:02,485 --> 00:23:05,572
我会使用传感器，试图定位我们
I'd be using the sensors, trying to locate us.

250
00:23:05,739 --> 00:23:08,867
很好，如果我们能找我们到被传送下来的地方
Good. If we could find the place where we beamed down,

251
00:23:09,034 --> 00:23:10,952
飞船可能会传送我们上去
the ship might beam us up.

252
00:23:11,119 --> 00:23:14,789
- 让我们到那里去  - 我们不知道它在哪里
- Let's get there. - We can't know where it is.

253
00:23:14,956 --> 00:23:17,208
1,000英里内的任何地方
Anywhere within 1,000 miles.

254
00:23:17,375 --> 00:23:23,006
史波克，试着找出一条出去的路，别再解释我们为什么不能出去了
Spock, try to find a way out and quit explaining why we can't get out.

255
00:23:23,173 --> 00:23:26,593
考虑到我们必须在5:00之前找到那个方法
We have until 5:00 to find that way. Consider this.

256
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:30,346
手头有哪些1881年的材料
What materials were on hand in 1881

257
00:23:30,513 --> 00:23:33,892
可以帮助我们按照厄普兄弟的方式来对抗他们？
that could help us fight the Earps on their own terms?

258
00:23:34,059 --> 00:23:37,854
- 我们有这些  - 他们给我们那些东西来处决我们
- We have these. - They gave us those to execute us.

259
00:23:38,021 --> 00:23:40,440
我们必须让厄普兄弟停止活动
We have to put the Earps out of action.

260
00:23:40,732 --> 00:23:44,944
现在有什么东西可以帮助我们摆脱这个陷阱吗？
Does anything exist here and now that could help us out of this trap?

261
00:23:48,073 --> 00:23:53,286
那些西部哥萨克只有毒蛇和仙人掌植物
Those Western Cossacks only had poisonous snakes and cactus plants.

262
00:23:53,453 --> 00:23:57,415
老骨头，毒液，植物，你能利用它们吗？
Bones, the venom, the plants. Can you make use of them?

263
00:23:57,582 --> 00:24:00,835
当然！我可以做镇静剂！
Of course! I can make a tranquilizer!

264
00:24:01,002 --> 00:24:03,421
我可以制作一个装置来释放它
I could make a device to deliver it.

265
00:24:03,588 --> 00:24:05,673
你需要的原料有什么？
The ingredients you require?

266
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:08,927
我知道哪里可以买到合适的药物
I know the place to get the proper drugs.

267
00:24:09,094 --> 00:24:12,180
- 我需要研钵和研杵  - 契科夫
- I'll need a mortar and a pestle. - Chekov.

268
00:24:12,347 --> 00:24:14,724
你将如何提供镇静剂？
How will you deliver the tranquilizer?

269
00:24:15,016 --> 00:24:19,395
- 我需要引信和棉絮  - 试试药房
- I'll need fusing and cotton wadding. - Try the apothecary.

270
00:24:19,562 --> 00:24:25,110
我将制造类似老式引发罐的东西
I shall manufacture the equivalent of an ancient generating canister,

271
00:24:25,401 --> 00:24:28,613
更广为人知的名称是毒气手榴弹
more familiarly known as a gas grenade.

272
00:24:37,163 --> 00:24:41,751
我还要等五分钟左右。你可以回来了
I'll be about five minutes yet. You could come back.

273
00:24:42,043 --> 00:24:44,879
谢谢你，介意我环顾四周吗？
Thank you. Mind if I look around a bit?

274
00:24:53,596 --> 00:24:57,725
- 粗糙但非常有用  - 我不会碰那些东西
- Crude but very usable. - I wouldn't touch that stuff.

275
00:24:57,892 --> 00:25:00,270
我知道如何处理这个
I know how to handle this.

276
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:07,902
我也急需少量的这种药物
I have an urgent need for a small supply of this drug, too.

277
00:25:08,194 --> 00:25:11,614
那是他的，你最好问问他
That belongs to him. You'd better ask him.

278
00:25:13,408 --> 00:25:17,036
所以你是牙医？嗯，我是一名医生
So you're the dentist? Well, I'm a physician.

279
00:25:17,203 --> 00:25:22,125
我想知道你是否介意我借一点这个
I wonder if you'd mind if I borrowed a small quantity of this.

280
00:25:29,716 --> 00:25:34,095
- 你现在要吗？  - 我叫麦考伊，我医生
- You want it now? - My name is McCoy. I'm a doctor.

281
00:25:34,345 --> 00:25:39,017
这个笑话已经传遍整个小镇了，麦克洛韦里
That joke is all around town already, McLowery.

282
00:25:39,184 --> 00:25:42,645
但我的名字仍然是霍利德
But my name is still Holliday.

283
00:25:42,812 --> 00:25:45,106
多克·霍利德
Doc Holliday.

284
00:25:50,403 --> 00:25:53,239
…紧急情况是真的，我需要这些东西
The... emergency is real. I need these things.

285
00:25:55,825 --> 00:25:58,870
你的紧急情况肯定是真的
Your emergency sure is real.

286
00:26:02,957 --> 00:26:07,212
去吧，拿上东西，多找点乐子
Go on. Take the stuff. Have some more fun.

287
00:26:11,132 --> 00:26:13,801
拿上我的包
Take my bag.

288
00:26:13,968 --> 00:26:17,013
你最好在5:00之前完成
Only best you be finished before 5:00.

289
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:21,434
那是我想要的，医生
That is my intention, Doctor.

290
00:26:21,601 --> 00:26:26,689
因为在五点零一分，你会发现你的脑袋有一个洞
Because at one minute past five, you'll find a hole in your head.

291
00:26:29,859 --> 00:26:32,320
用这把枪打的
Right from this gun.

292
00:27:05,561 --> 00:27:07,063
[清嗓子]
[CLEARS THROAT]

293
00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:09,065
西尔维亚！
Sylvia!

294
00:27:11,484 --> 00:27:13,278
你好
Hello.

295
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:17,824
比利，你知道我对你有多痴迷吗？
Billy, do you know how crazy I am about you?

296
00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:21,035
那...真不错
That's... very nice.

297
00:27:23,663 --> 00:27:27,125
你不问问我包里有什么吗？
Aren't you going to ask what's in my bag?

298
00:27:27,292 --> 00:27:30,420
这正是我准备要问的
That's just what I was preparing to inquire.

299
00:27:32,672 --> 00:27:35,008
你去购物了吗？
Have you been shopping?

300
00:27:35,174 --> 00:27:39,262
当然，在一个美好的下午，我还能做什么
Of course. What else would I be doing on a beautiful afternoon,

301
00:27:39,429 --> 00:27:41,639
距离舞会只有一周了？
with the dance only one week away?

302
00:27:41,806 --> 00:27:46,060
- 还是说你已经忘记了？  - 不，我没忘记
- Or have you forgotten that already? - No, I haven't forgotten.

303
00:27:46,227 --> 00:27:52,358
我很期待……非常期待
I am looking forward to it... most eagerly.

304
00:27:53,526 --> 00:27:57,989
当我穿着我要做的礼服时你绝对会疯狂
You'll be absolutely wild when you see me in the gown I'm going to make.

305
00:27:58,156 --> 00:28:04,120
我找到了了这种最绝妙的料子，有很多码
I found this most scrumptious material. Yards and yards of it.

306
00:28:07,457 --> 00:28:10,710
你知道我在想什么吗，比利？
You know what I was thinking, Billy?

307
00:28:10,877 --> 00:28:15,006
我在想它能做一件多么漂亮的婚纱啊
I was thinking what a beautiful wedding gown it would make.

308
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:20,595
我们为什么不把那场舞会变成婚礼舞会呢？
Why don't we turn that dance into a wedding ball?

309
00:28:20,845 --> 00:28:23,181
那将是无比美好的
It would be so heavenly.

310
00:28:25,808 --> 00:28:28,478
结婚？
Married?

311
00:28:29,729 --> 00:28:33,649
恐怕……那不可能
I'm afraid... that wouldn't be possible.

312
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:41,532
我有把握会准备好礼服，还有什么能阻止我们？
But I'm positive the gown will be ready. What else is there to stop us?

313
00:28:41,699 --> 00:28:47,747
这是绝对不可能的，我不是你可以嫁的人
It is absolutely impossible. I am not someone you can marry.

314
00:28:47,914 --> 00:28:54,462
如果我能告诉你……我的真实身份就好了
If only I could make clear to you... what I really am.

315
00:28:54,629 --> 00:28:57,757
你以为我不知道吗？
Do you think I don't know?

316
00:28:57,924 --> 00:29:02,845
比利·克莱伯恩，你是个偷牛贼和偷马贼
Billy Claiborne, you are a cattle rustler and a horse thief

317
00:29:03,012 --> 00:29:05,890
我不在乎其他的
and I don't care what else.

318
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:12,897
我警告过你，克莱伯恩，离远点
I warned you, Claiborne. Stay away.

319
00:29:13,189 --> 00:29:14,899
[西尔维亚尖叫]
[SYLVIA SCREAMS]

320
00:29:21,447 --> 00:29:25,827
我在这里的时候，你不必从那个人渣那里拿任何东西
You don't have to take anything from that scum while I'm here.

321
00:29:27,829 --> 00:29:32,542
厄普先生，别碰她
Mr. Earp. Get your hands off her.

322
00:29:51,894 --> 00:29:53,479
[尖叫]
[SCREAMS]

323
00:30:20,089 --> 00:30:23,134
我无能为力，吉姆
There's nothing I can do, Jim.

324
00:30:40,776 --> 00:30:43,946
来吧，克兰顿，现在就决斗吧
Come on, Clanton. Let's do it now.

325
00:30:50,870 --> 00:30:55,124
- 舰长，让我来  - 是的，拜托，舰长，让他来
- Captain, let me. - Yeah, come on, Captain. Let him.

326
00:30:55,291 --> 00:30:58,294
- 我们不能只是站在这里  - 我们可以
- We can't just stand here. - Yes, we can.

327
00:30:58,461 --> 00:31:02,006
- 但他们谋杀了契科夫！- 斯科提
- But they murdered Chekov! - Scotty.

328
00:31:02,173 --> 00:31:06,469
- 他们想逼我们  - 现在还不是我们的时间
- They're trying to push us. - And it is not yet our time.

329
00:31:18,022 --> 00:31:19,315
算了吧，他死了
Let it go. He's dead.

330
00:31:19,899 --> 00:31:23,361
因为我忽略了梅尔克特警告
Because I ignored the Melkot warning.

331
00:31:25,655 --> 00:31:31,536
我们在入伍时都知道有风险，现在让它过去吧
We all knew the risk when we joined the service. Now let it go.

332
00:31:31,702 --> 00:31:36,707
有一件事需要我们立即注意
There is one thing which requires our immediate attention,

333
00:31:36,874 --> 00:31:40,503
具体来说，是我们的未来
specifically, our future.

334
00:31:40,670 --> 00:31:44,006
但不是这一刻，史波克
But not this minute, Spock.

335
00:31:44,173 --> 00:31:48,010
我们需要更长的时间
It takes us a little longer.

336
00:31:50,096 --> 00:31:53,558
我理解这种感受，舰长
I understand the feeling, Captain.

337
00:31:53,724 --> 00:31:57,270
你谈论另一个人的感受，你感受到了什么？
You talk about another man's feelings. What do you feel?

338
00:31:57,436 --> 00:32:00,648
我的感情不是讨论的话题
My feelings are not a subject for discussion.

339
00:32:00,815 --> 00:32:06,654
- 没有感情可谈  - 斯波克先生，契科夫死了！
- There are no feelings to discuss. - Mr. Spock, Chekov is dead!

340
00:32:06,821 --> 00:32:10,032
我现在说出来了，但还是难以相信
I say it now and I can hardly believe it.

341
00:32:10,199 --> 00:32:12,868
但他值得一些纪念
But he deserves some memorial.

342
00:32:13,035 --> 00:32:17,582
史波克不会悲伤，斯科提，悲伤是种人性
Spock will have no truck with grief, Scotty. It's human.

343
00:32:18,541 --> 00:32:24,171
- 老骨头，斯科提...  - 舰长，没关系
- Bones, Scotty... - Captain, it's quite all right.

344
00:32:24,338 --> 00:32:27,133
他们忘记了我是半个人类
They forget I am half human.

345
00:32:31,262 --> 00:32:33,639
[钟声]
[CLOCK CHIMES]

346
00:32:40,229 --> 00:32:42,690
我们没有太多时间
We don't have much time.

347
00:32:42,982 --> 00:32:48,988
我依稀记得我们即将参加的战斗的报道
I vaguely remember the account of the battle in which we are about to engage.

348
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:52,325
- 但我很困惑  - 关于什么？
- But I am confused. - About what?

349
00:32:52,491 --> 00:32:55,745
既然我们每个人都代表克兰顿帮的成员--
Since each of us represents members of the Clanton gang --

350
00:32:55,911 --> 00:32:58,873
你是艾克·克兰顿，我是弗兰克·麦克劳里
you Ike Clanton, I Frank McLowery --

351
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:03,419
那么契科夫先生就是另一个比利，不是吗？
then Mr. Chekov would be the other Billy, would he not?

352
00:33:03,586 --> 00:33:07,757
- 威廉·克莱伯恩  - 但是，威廉·克莱伯恩
- William Claiborne. - But did not William Claiborne

353
00:33:08,049 --> 00:33:11,761
不是在OK畜栏的战斗中幸存下来了吗？
survive the battle at the OK Corral?

354
00:33:14,930 --> 00:33:17,558
说重点，史波克
Get to the point, Spock.

355
00:33:17,725 --> 00:33:22,688
契科夫先生死了，但在实际的枪战中，威廉·克莱伯恩活了下来
Mr. Chekov is dead. But in the actual gunfight, William Claiborne survived.

356
00:33:24,190 --> 00:33:27,610
是的，是的，这是正确的
Yes. Yes, that's right.

357
00:33:27,777 --> 00:33:32,073
所以不是非得按原来的情况发生，我们可以改变它
So it doesn't have to happen the way it happened. We can change it.

358
00:33:35,701 --> 00:33:38,663
进展如何？  - 我会在史波克之前做好准备
- How's that coming? - I'll be ready before Spock.

359
00:33:38,829 --> 00:33:40,748
- 史波克？  - 还有一个小时
- Spock? - Another hour.

360
00:33:40,915 --> 00:33:43,459
- 我们会有手榴弹？  - 不准确
- We'll have a grenade? - Not precisely.

361
00:33:43,626 --> 00:33:46,629
- 别管叫法了，它能行吗？  - 应该可以
- Forget precision. Will it work? - It should.

362
00:33:46,796 --> 00:33:50,591
如果我们不让他们镇静下来，我们就必须与他们战斗
If we don't tranquilize them, we'll have to fight them.

363
00:33:50,758 --> 00:33:53,761
如果我们与他们战斗，我们都会死
And if we fight them, we all die.

364
00:33:53,928 --> 00:33:56,055
谈判可以为我们赢得时间
Negotiating could buy us time.

365
00:33:56,222 --> 00:34:01,811
但不是和厄普兄弟，我试过了，一定有办法的
But not with the Earps. I've tried that. There must be a way.

366
00:34:05,272 --> 00:34:10,986
历史已经改变，克莱伯恩没死，但契科夫死了
History has been changed. Claiborne didn't die but Chekov is dead.

367
00:34:11,153 --> 00:34:14,240
这意味着这次一定有办法改变
That means there must be a way to change this time.

368
00:34:14,532 --> 00:34:18,285
值得一试，至少在我们对设备有把握之前
It would be worth a try, at least until we're certain of the device.

369
00:34:18,452 --> 00:34:21,372
然后也许我们可以让事情平息下来
Then perhaps we could quiet things down.

370
00:34:21,539 --> 00:34:24,166
不是和厄普兄弟
Not with the Earps.

371
00:34:25,418 --> 00:34:29,380
还有一个地方我可以试试
There is one other place I can try.

372
00:34:37,138 --> 00:34:39,849
你在找人吗？
You looking for somebody?

373
00:34:43,018 --> 00:34:45,271
是的，警长
Yes, Sheriff.

374
00:34:46,564 --> 00:34:49,483
- 我要你阻止冲突  - 阻止它？
- I want you to stop the fight. - Stop it?

375
00:34:49,650 --> 00:34:52,903
谁想阻止它？我肯定不想，你也不想
Who wants to stop it? I sure don't. You don't.

376
00:34:53,070 --> 00:34:55,406
- 你昨天还不想的  - 我现在想了
- You didn't yesterday. - I do now.

377
00:34:55,573 --> 00:34:58,242
一个克兰顿家的人何时学会向法律求助了？
When does a Clanton crawl to the law for help?

378
00:34:58,534 --> 00:35:00,870
- 他还能怎样伸张正义？  - 用这个
- How else can he get justice? - From this.

379
00:35:01,036 --> 00:35:03,998
你安排这整件事是为了解决厄尔普家族的事
You set up this whole thing to take care of the Earps.

380
00:35:04,165 --> 00:35:07,877
- 决定反对它为时已晚  - 不算太晚
- It's too late to decide against it. - It's not too late.

381
00:35:08,961 --> 00:35:10,713
警长，警长
Sheriff. Sheriff.

382
00:35:13,549 --> 00:35:16,594
让我们把不喜欢厄普兄弟的人组织起来
Let's organize the people who don't like the Earps.

383
00:35:16,761 --> 00:35:21,974
不要胡说八道，他们指望你们除掉厄普兄弟
Don't talk nonsense. They're counting on you to get rid of the Earps.

384
00:35:22,141 --> 00:35:24,727
他们最好让法律为他们所用
They'd better let the law work for them.

385
00:35:24,894 --> 00:35:29,106
今天厄尔普家族对比利做了那样的事，你还能这样说话？
You can talk that way after what the Earps did to Billy today?

386
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:34,945
这个镇上没有人会拒绝你报仇的权利
Nobody in this town will deny you your right to your revenge.

387
00:35:38,449 --> 00:35:43,662
是的，我要复仇，我想取厄普一家的命
Yes, I want revenge. I want to crush the life out of the Earps.

388
00:35:45,331 --> 00:35:48,626
- 但我不能只是杀了他们  - 你听我说
- But I can't just kill them. - You listen to me.

389
00:35:48,793 --> 00:35:50,711
躲在OK畜栏
Hide at the OK Corral.

390
00:35:50,878 --> 00:35:53,923
当厄普兄弟来找你时，你伏击他们
When the Earps come looking, you bushwhack them.

391
00:35:54,089 --> 00:35:57,218
- 我不能这样杀了他们！- 这是唯一的办法！
- I can't just kill them! - It's the only way!

392
00:35:57,384 --> 00:36:00,095
我不能谋杀他们！我不能杀他们！
I can't murder them! I can't kill them!

393
00:36:00,262 --> 00:36:03,057
尽你所能杀死他们！
Kill them any way you can!

394
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:08,479
不会有任何问题，真的
There will be no questions asked. Honest.

395
00:36:08,646 --> 00:36:12,191
我保证
I guarantee that.

396
00:36:22,368 --> 00:36:26,455
这些原油效果相当好
These crude supplies worked quite well.

397
00:36:26,622 --> 00:36:30,960
我怀疑这些东西曾经被用于这样的目的
I doubt these things were ever used for any purpose like this.

398
00:36:31,126 --> 00:36:35,047
如果他们有你的聪明才智，也许他们会这样做
Perhaps they would have been if they'd had your ingenuity.

399
00:36:41,428 --> 00:36:43,430
舰长？
Captain?

400
00:36:44,473 --> 00:36:47,685
- 多久能准备好？  - 就现在
- How soon will that be ready? - Right now.

401
00:36:49,270 --> 00:36:51,939
镇静剂要多久才能起作用？
How long until the tranquilizer works?

402
00:36:52,189 --> 00:36:55,776
- 三秒钟  - 你是怎么测试的？
- Three seconds. - How did you test it?

403
00:36:56,819 --> 00:37:01,740
- 没有测试过  - 这很简单，什么都不会出错
- It has not been tested. - It's simple. Nothing can go wrong.

404
00:37:01,907 --> 00:37:05,286
到现在为止，一切都出错了，我要测试一下
Up to now, everything has gone wrong. I want it tested.

405
00:37:06,370 --> 00:37:09,498
志愿者能解决问题吗？
Would a volunteer solve the problem?

406
00:37:09,665 --> 00:37:13,502
- 能  - 好吧，有一个条件
- It would. - All right. On one condition.

407
00:37:13,669 --> 00:37:16,672
我和你要在5:00前清醒
That I'm wide awake and with you at 5:00.

408
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:20,593
- 我保证  - 好的
- Guaranteed. - All right.

409
00:37:25,764 --> 00:37:28,058
这是为了止痛
It's to kill the pain.

410
00:37:28,225 --> 00:37:32,855
- 但这是无痛的  - 你应该早点告诉我的
- But this is painless. - You should have warned me sooner.

411
00:37:33,022 --> 00:37:35,024
开始吧
Fire away.

412
00:38:10,851 --> 00:38:15,189
- 它应该有用，你吸气了吗？  - 是的，深吸气了
- It should work. Did you inhale? - Aye. Deeply.

413
00:38:15,481 --> 00:38:18,233
- 你还觉得好吗？  - 再好不过了
- You still feel all right? - Never felt better.

414
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:21,862
- 没有头晕？出汗？  - 它没有用
- No dizziness? Sweating? - It doesn't work.

415
00:38:23,155 --> 00:38:26,617
- 真有趣  - 这是我们最后的机会
- Fascinating. - It was our last chance.

416
00:38:29,286 --> 00:38:32,665
队长，你好像没听懂
Captain, you don't seem to understand.

417
00:38:32,831 --> 00:38:35,793
它没有起作用，但它一定是有效的
It did not function, but it must function.

418
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:38,712
不会出错的，它应该有效的
Nothing could go wrong. It should work.

419
00:38:38,879 --> 00:38:41,006
一个科学事实
A scientific fact.

420
00:38:41,173 --> 00:38:44,760
但如果镇静剂不起作用
But if the tranquilizer does not function,

421
00:38:44,927 --> 00:38:48,722
那么就必须改变我们的思维模式了
then an alteration of our thought patterns must be in order.

422
00:38:48,889 --> 00:38:52,643
我们需要一把武器，一个解决办法
We need a weapon. An answer.

423
00:38:53,602 --> 00:38:57,731
现在不必担心这个，看看钟
Don't have to worry about that now. Look at the clock.

424
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:04,655
10分钟，这一切都将在OK畜栏结束
Ten minutes. It's all going to end at the OK Corral.

425
00:39:04,822 --> 00:39:09,576
我们要在这里等到5:00以后
We're going to wait right here until well after 5:00.

426
00:39:09,743 --> 00:39:12,454
我们不会离开这个地方
We're not going to move from this spot.

427
00:39:16,834 --> 00:39:18,919
[马嘶声]
[HORSE NEIGHS]

428
00:39:32,307 --> 00:39:34,351
我们离开这里吧！
Let's get out of here!

429
00:39:39,481 --> 00:39:41,692
斯科提，老骨头
Scotty, Bones.

430
00:39:49,742 --> 00:39:51,910
我们被困住了
We're trapped.

431
00:39:52,077 --> 00:39:55,873
他们如愿以偿，我们必须站起来战斗
They got their way. We've got to stand and fight.

432
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:59,418
好的，如果他们想打架，那就打吧
Good. If they want a fight, let's give them a fight.

433
00:39:59,585 --> 00:40:02,129
他们是专家，我们不会有机会了
They're experts. We won't have a chance.

434
00:40:02,296 --> 00:40:05,799
- 我们最好成为专家  - 那可能没有必要
- We'd better become experts. - That may not be necessary.

435
00:40:05,966 --> 00:40:08,594
- 你想到什么了吗？  - 一个事实
- You've got something? - A fact.

436
00:40:08,761 --> 00:40:11,930
物理定律是不容忽视的
Physical laws simply cannot be ignored.

437
00:40:12,097 --> 00:40:14,475
没有他们就不能存在
Existence cannot be without them.

438
00:40:14,767 --> 00:40:19,646
- 你是什么意思？  - 我们面临着矛盾
- What do you mean? - We are faced with a contradiction.

439
00:40:19,897 --> 00:40:23,734
你创造的镇静剂应该是有效的
The tranquilizer you created should have been effective.

440
00:40:23,901 --> 00:40:28,739
- 它在任何地方都该有效  - 确实
- It would have been anywhere else. - Exactly.

441
00:40:28,906 --> 00:40:33,285
医生，在您看来，是什么杀死了契科夫先生？
Doctor, in your opinion, what killed Mr. Chekov?

442
00:40:33,452 --> 00:40:37,623
- 他体内的一块铅  - 错
- A piece of lead in his body. - Wrong.

443
00:40:37,790 --> 00:40:41,126
- 他的意识杀死了他  - 如果你有答案，告诉我们！
- His mind killed him. - If you've got the answer, tell us!

444
00:40:41,293 --> 00:40:44,880
物理现实符合普遍规律
The physical reality is consistent with universal laws.

445
00:40:45,047 --> 00:40:49,510
当定律不起作用时，就没有现实
When the laws do not operate, there is no reality.

446
00:40:49,676 --> 00:40:52,179
这一切都是不真实的
All of this is unreal.

447
00:40:52,346 --> 00:40:55,474
你是什​​么意思？我检查了契科夫，他死了
What do you mean? I examined Chekov. He's dead.

448
00:40:55,641 --> 00:40:59,186
你在我们无法信任的条件下进行了检查
You made your examination under conditions we cannot trust.

449
00:41:00,145 --> 00:41:03,023
我们通过感官的反应来判断现实
We judge reality by the response of our senses.

450
00:41:03,190 --> 00:41:06,401
一旦我们确信某种情况的真实性
Once we are convinced of the reality of a situation,

451
00:41:06,693 --> 00:41:08,821
我们遵守它的规则
we abide by its rules.

452
00:41:08,987 --> 00:41:12,241
我们判断子弹是实心的，枪支是真实的
We judge the bullets to be solid, the guns to be real.

453
00:41:12,407 --> 00:41:15,160
因此，他们可以杀人
Therefore, they can kill.

454
00:41:16,328 --> 00:41:20,332
契科夫死了是因为他相信子弹会杀死他？
Chekov is dead because he believed the bullets would kill him?

455
00:41:20,499 --> 00:41:23,710
他可能真的死了，我们不知道
He may indeed be dead. We do not know.

456
00:41:23,877 --> 00:41:28,966
但我们确实知道，梅尔克特人创造了这个环境
But we do know that the Melkotians created the situation.

457
00:41:29,133 --> 00:41:34,346
如果我们不相信子弹是真实的，它们就不能杀死我们
If we do not believe that the bullets are real, they cannot kill us.

458
00:41:34,513 --> 00:41:40,185
确实如此，我知道子弹是不真实的，因此它们不能伤害我
Exactly. I know the bullets are unreal, therefore they cannot harm me.

459
00:41:41,854 --> 00:41:44,773
我们必须都非常确定才能救我们的性命
We must all be certain to save our lives.

460
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:47,484
- 不错  - 但那是不可能的
- Precisely. - But that's not possible.

461
00:41:47,651 --> 00:41:52,030
- 总会有一些疑问  - 一丁点儿怀疑都会要了你的命
- There would always be some doubt. - The smallest doubt would kill you.

462
00:41:52,197 --> 00:41:57,786
我们只是人类，史波克，我们没有你的发条心脏
We're just human beings, Spock. We don't have your clockwork ticker.

463
00:41:57,953 --> 00:42:00,539
- 我们不能打开和关闭它  - 必须要
- We can't turn it on and off. - We must.

464
00:42:00,706 --> 00:42:03,375
史波克，瓦肯的心灵融合
Spock, a Vulcan mind-meld.

465
00:42:05,335 --> 00:42:09,423
很好，长官，轮机长？
Very well, sir. Engineer?

466
00:42:43,165 --> 00:42:47,461
你的意识到我的意识
Your mind to my mind.

467
00:42:48,629 --> 00:42:52,466
你的想法到我的想法
Your thoughts to my thoughts.

468
00:43:12,611 --> 00:43:15,906
子弹是不真实的
The bullets are unreal.

469
00:43:17,324 --> 00:43:19,868
没有实体
Without body.

470
00:43:20,035 --> 00:43:22,788
它们只是幻觉
They are illusions only.

471
00:43:24,122 --> 00:43:28,085
没有实质的阴影
Shadows without substance.

472
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:34,466
它们不会穿过你的身体
They will not pass through your body,

473
00:43:34,633 --> 00:43:38,053
因为它们不存在
for they do not exist.

474
00:43:39,972 --> 00:43:43,350
它们不存在
They do not exist.

475
00:43:55,070 --> 00:43:57,239
不真实
Unreal.

476
00:43:57,406 --> 00:44:00,867
只是表象
Appearances only.

477
00:44:01,034 --> 00:44:04,663
他们是影子，假象
They are shadows. Illusions.

478
00:44:06,248 --> 00:44:09,960
只是现实的幽灵
Nothing but ghosts of reality.

479
00:44:12,713 --> 00:44:17,009
他们是谎言，谎言
They are lies. Falsehoods.

480
00:44:17,175 --> 00:44:20,887
没有实体的幽灵
Spectres without body.

481
00:44:22,014 --> 00:44:25,058
忽略他们
They are to be ignored.

482
00:44:34,776 --> 00:44:36,862
舰长
Captain.

483
00:44:53,670 --> 00:44:56,548
拔枪吧
Draw.

484
00:46:20,507 --> 00:46:23,301
舰长，我…不明白
Captain, I... don't understand.

485
00:46:23,468 --> 00:46:25,971
我也没有，他非常jian健康 kang
Neither do I. He's in perfect health.

486
00:46:26,138 --> 00:46:29,724
- 我去哪儿了？  - 似乎就在这里
- Where have I been? - Right here, it seems.

487
00:46:29,891 --> 00:46:35,439
但是那个女孩，她是如此美丽，太真实了
But that girl. She was so beautiful. So real.

488
00:46:35,605 --> 00:46:39,526
- 你还记得别的吗？  - 没有了
- Do you remember anything else? - No.

489
00:46:39,693 --> 00:46:44,364
这就解释了他为什么会在这里，什么都不是真的，除了那女孩
That explains why he was here. Nothing was real to him except the girl.

490
00:46:44,656 --> 00:46:47,492
舰长，梅尔克特物体
Captain, the Melkotian object.

491
00:46:51,037 --> 00:46:52,706
传感器读数
Sensor readings.

492
00:46:52,956 --> 00:46:58,628
该物体正在发射极不稳定的射线
The object is emitting rays of a highly unstable nature.

493
00:46:58,795 --> 00:47:02,841
拉响红色警报，偏转护盾全开
Sound Red Alert. Deflector shields on full.

494
00:47:03,008 --> 00:47:05,594
枪手们，锁定目标
Gun crews, lock on target.

495
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:09,139
能量输出增加超过可测量的水平
Energy output increasing beyond measurable levels.

496
00:47:09,306 --> 00:47:12,100
相位枪，待命开火
Phaser guns, stand by to fire.

497
00:47:25,322 --> 00:47:29,367
它……它不见了，长官
It's... It's gone, sir.

498
00:47:29,534 --> 00:47:33,705
- 损坏报告  - 没有，所有甲板全面运作
- Damage report. - None. All decks fully operational.

499
00:47:33,997 --> 00:47:37,000
梅尔克特：<i>柯克舰长</i>
MELKOT: <i>Captain Kirk.</i>

500
00:47:37,167 --> 00:47:39,753
<i>你没有杀人</i>
<i>You did not kill.</i>

501
00:47:44,007 --> 00:47:47,677
- <i>这是你们种族的处理方式吗？</i>  - 是的
- <i>Is this the way of your kind?</i> - It is.

502
00:47:48,762 --> 00:47:52,140
我们只有在别无选择的时候才会战斗，我们更喜欢和平
We fight only when there's no choice. We prefer peace.

503
00:47:52,307 --> 00:47:56,520
我代表一个相信同样事物的生物联盟
I speak for an alliance of creatures who believe in the same thing.

504
00:47:56,811 --> 00:48:01,441
我们已邀请你们加入我们，我们的使命是和平
We have sought you out to join us. Our mission is one of peace.

505
00:48:07,197 --> 00:48:12,994
<i>靠近我们的星球，欢迎你们，代表团会出来迎接你</i>
<i>Approach our planet. Be welcome. A delegation will come out to meet you.</i>

506
00:48:13,161 --> 00:48:16,665
<i>我们的警告威胁已经结束</i>
<i>Our warning threats are over.</i>

507
00:48:20,335 --> 00:48:25,006
好极了，上尉，取消红色警报
Excellent. Lieutenant, cancel Red Alert.

508
00:48:25,173 --> 00:48:30,136
- 继续原航线，曲速2  - 曲速2，长官
- Resume original course, warp 2. - Warp factor 2, sir.

509
00:48:37,185 --> 00:48:44,109
舰长，我可以问个问题吗？如果太私人了，你不必回答
Captain, may I ask a question? You needn't answer if it's too personal.

510
00:48:44,276 --> 00:48:46,903
我确定我能回答
I'm sure I'll be able to answer.

511
00:48:48,905 --> 00:48:56,079
今天下午，你想杀人，是吗？
This afternoon, you wanted to kill, didn't you?

512
00:48:56,246 --> 00:49:00,458
- 但他没有杀人，史波克先生  - 但他想，医生
- But he didn't kill, Mr. Spock. - But he wanted to, Doctor.

513
00:49:00,625 --> 00:49:03,837
- 在你看来是这样吗？  - 是的，舰长
- Is that the way it seemed to you? - Yes, Captain.

514
00:49:05,046 --> 00:49:10,218
史波克先生，你说得很对，事实也正是如此
Mr. Spock, you're absolutely right. That's exactly the way it was.

515
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:16,057
人类，准备杀戮
Mankind, ready to kill.

516
00:49:16,224 --> 00:49:18,351
那是1881年的情况了
That's the way it was in 1881.

517
00:49:18,518 --> 00:49:23,440
我想知道人类是如何生存下来的
I wonder how humanity managed to survive.

518
00:49:25,233 --> 00:49:28,945
我们克服了暴力的本能
We overcame our instinct for violence.
