00:00:07,695 --> 00:00:10,949
企业号正被肆虐的流行病阴影笼罩

5
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:17,205
为了对抗疾病
In order to combat the illness,

6
00:00:17,372 --> 00:00:20,705
麦考伊医生需要大量的瑞他啉
Dr. McCoy needs large quantities of ryetalyn,

7
00:00:21,042 --> 00:00:23,079
是这种发热的唯一已知的退烧药
which is the only known antidote for the fever.

8
00:00:23,836 --> 00:00:27,048
我们的传感器检测到了大量的纯瑞他啉

9
00:00:27,166 --> 00:00:29,759
在欧米茄星系的一颗小行星上

00:00:39,452 --> 00:00:41,589
[麦考伊] 我有四个小时来处理它
[McCoy] I've got four hours to process that stuff.

14
00:00:41,725 --> 00:00:43,565
否则疫情将不可逆转
Otherwise the epidemic will be irreversible.

15
00:00:43,793 --> 00:00:45,472
企业号上的每个人将会…
Everybody on board the Enterprise will...

16
00:00:45,472 --> 00:00:46,685
奇怪
Strange.

17
00:00:47,321 --> 00:00:50,899
读数表明附近有人类生命形式
Readings indicate a life-form in the vicinity, apparently human.

18
00:00:51,391 --> 00:00:55,129
然而，飞船传感器显示这颗行星无人居住
Yet ship sensors indicated this planet was uninhabited.

19
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:57,928
让我们去弄到那个瑞他啉
Let's get that ryetalyn.

20
00:01:00,581 --> 00:01:02,203
[电子叮当声]

21
00:01:23,104 --> 00:01:24,298
没用

22
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:39,161
不要杀人
Do not kill.

23
00:01:46,127 --> 00:01:47,606
我是詹姆斯·柯克舰长
I'm Captain James Kirk...

24
00:01:47,606 --> 00:01:49,338
我知道你是谁
I know who you are.

25
00:01:49,505 --> 00:01:52,338
我一直在监视你的飞船，自从它进入这个星系
I have monitored your ship since it entered this system.

26
00:01:53,593 --> 00:01:57,180
那既然你知道我们是谁，你也知道我们为什么在这里，怎么称呼？
Then if you know who we are, you know why we're here, Mr...?

27
00:01:57,346 --> 00:02:00,767
弗林特，你得离开我的星球
Flint. You will leave my planet.

28
00:02:01,809 --> 00:02:03,936
你说是你的星球，先生？
Did you say your planet, sir?

29
00:02:04,061 --> 00:02:07,257
我的隐居之地，逃避地球生活
My retreat from the unpleasantness of life on Earth

30
00:02:07,565 --> 00:02:09,317
和人类陪伴的的不愉快

31
00:02:09,821 --> 00:02:14,120
弗林特先生，我的船员们病了
Mr. Flint, I have a sick crew up there.

32
00:02:14,586 --> 00:02:16,426
我们无法及时到达另一个星球
We can't possibly reach another planet in time.

33
00:02:16,503 --> 00:02:17,910
你不能拒绝给我们瑞他啉
You can't refuse us the ryetalyn.

34
00:02:18,249 --> 00:02:19,657
你这是非法入侵，舰长
You're trespassing, Captain.

35
00:02:21,395 --> 00:02:22,463
我们有需要
We're in need.

36
00:02:24,332 --> 00:02:26,703
我们会支付费用的，工作也好，物品交换也行
We'll pay for it, work for it, trade for it.

37
00:02:27,251 --> 00:02:28,797
你没有我想要的
You have nothing I want.

38
00:02:29,001 --> 00:02:31,589
但你有我们需要的瑞他啉
But you have the ryetalyn that we need.

39
00:02:32,935 --> 00:02:34,471
如果有必要，我们会采取强制手段
If necessary, we'll take it.

40
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:38,631
如果你不主动离开，我有能力强制让你走
If you do not leave voluntarily, I have the power to force you.

41
00:02:39,693 --> 00:02:41,447
或者原地杀了你
Or kill you where you stand.

42
00:02:54,785 --> 00:02:57,371
[柯克]宇宙，最后的边疆
[Kirk] Space, the final frontier.

43
00:03:03,663 --> 00:03:06,927
这些是星舰企业号的航程
These are the voyages of the starship Enterprise.

44
00:03:07,917 --> 00:03:11,848
它的五年任务：探索未知的新世界

45

46
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:19,225

Requiem for Methuselah
玛士撒拉的安魂曲

柯克呼叫企业号，斯科特先生，将相位炮瞄准我们的坐标
Kirk to Enterprise. Mr. Scott, lock phasers onto our coordinates.

50
00:04:11,469 --> 00:04:13,952
[斯科特] 是的，舰长，所有相位炮都已瞄准
[Scott] Aye, Captain. All phasers locked on.

51
00:04:15,827 --> 00:04:18,491
弗林特先生，如果我们出了什么事
Mr. Flint, if anything happens to us,

52
00:04:19,312 --> 00:04:24,526
你也别想逃，随后我的船员会下来拿瑞他啉
four deaths and then my crew comes down and takes that ryetalyn.

53
00:04:28,071 --> 00:04:29,936
一个有趣的权力测试
An interesting test of power.

54
00:04:30,148 --> 00:04:33,311
你我的巨大力量对抗，谁会赢？
Your enormous forces against mine. Who would win?

55
00:04:34,447 --> 00:04:37,700
弗林特先生，除非你确定
Mr. Flint, unless you are certain,

56
00:04:38,161 --> 00:04:41,761
否则我建议你不要做无用的实验
I would suggest you refrain from a most useless experiment.

57
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:43,933
我们只需要几个小时
We need only a few hours.

58
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:46,733
你见过里瑞吉利热的受害者吗？
Have you ever seen a victim of Rigelian fever?

59
00:04:46,835 --> 00:04:48,267
他们在一天之内死去
They die in one day.

60
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:50,674
其效力就像黑死病一样
The effects are like Bubonic plague.

61
00:04:53,814 --> 00:04:57,417
1334年，夏天，君士坦丁堡
Constantinople, summer, 1334.

62
00:04:58,569 --> 00:05:01,065
它沿着街道，下水道散布开来
It marched through the streets, the sewers.

63
00:05:01,822 --> 00:05:05,481
乘牛车，经水路离开城市，杀死了半个欧洲
It left the city by oxcart, by sea, to kill half of Europe.

64
00:05:07,066 --> 00:05:10,985
老鼠们在夜里发出沙沙声和尖叫声，它们也死了
The rats, rustling and squealing in the night, as they, too, died.

65
00:05:12,764 --> 00:05:13,764
老鼠…
The rats...

66
00:05:14,205 --> 00:05:16,101
你是历史系的学者吗，先生？
Are you a student of history, sir?

67
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:20,725
是的
I am.

68
00:05:24,117 --> 00:05:25,890
企业号，一艘瘟疫飞船
The Enterprise, a plague ship.

69
00:05:27,025 --> 00:05:30,047
你有两个小时，两小时内你们得离开
You have two hours, at the end of which time, you will leave.

70
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:33,959
十分感激
With all due gratitude.

71
00:05:34,394 --> 00:05:36,762
M-4会收集你需要的瑞他啉
M-4 will gather the ryetalyn which you need.

72
00:05:43,155 --> 00:05:45,798
请允许我为你们提供更舒适的环境
Permit me to offer you more comfortable surroundings.

73
00:06:03,592 --> 00:06:04,901
进来吧，长官们
Come in, gentlemen.

74
00:06:08,222 --> 00:06:11,845
我们的飞船传感器没有显示你在这里，弗林特先生
Our ship's sensors did not reveal your presence here, Mr. Flint.

75
00:06:12,015 --> 00:06:15,970
我的星球被屏幕环绕，创造毫无生气的印象
My planet is surrounded by screens which create the impression of lifelessness:

76
00:06:16,161 --> 00:06:19,489
一种阻止好奇，不速之客的保护
A protection against the curious, the uninvited.

77
00:06:20,146 --> 00:06:22,122
那你一个人住在这里
Then you live here alone.

78
00:06:22,223 --> 00:06:27,966
除了M-4，它充当男仆、女仆、园丁和护卫
Except for M-4, which serves as butler, housekeeper, gardener and guardian.

79
00:06:29,035 --> 00:06:31,788
令人印象深刻的家，弗林特先生
A most impressive home, Mr. Flint.

80
00:06:33,416 --> 00:06:37,857
是的，莎士比亚第一对开本，古腾堡圣经
Yes. Shakespeare first folio, a Gutenberg Bible.

81
00:06:38,169 --> 00:06:41,428
半人马座七号的塔拉努卢斯的创作版画
The Creation lithographs by Taranullus of Centauri Seven.

82
00:06:41,657 --> 00:06:44,956
这是几个世纪以来银河系中最稀有的藏书之一
That's one of the rarest book collections in the galaxy, spanning centuries.

83
00:06:45,846 --> 00:06:47,584
不要拘束，先生们
Be comfortable, gentlemen.

84
00:06:50,314 --> 00:06:52,247
随便喝点白兰地
Help yourselves to brandy.

85
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:57,326
我们能信任他吗？
Do we trust him?

86
00:06:57,962 --> 00:07:00,590
目前这样做似乎是合乎逻辑的
It would seem logical to do so for the moment.

87
00:07:01,515 --> 00:07:04,974
嗯，我需要两个小时把瑞他啉处理成抗毒素
Well, I'll need two hours to process that ryetalyn into antitoxin.

88
00:07:05,071 --> 00:07:07,332
如果一小时后瑞他啉还没有到
If that ryetalyn isn't here in one hour,

89
00:07:07,391 --> 00:07:09,950
我们就去勘探，如果必要越过弗林特先生
we'll go prospecting, right over Mr. Flint if necessary.

90
00:07:11,327 --> 00:07:16,769
这是我见过的最了不起的私人艺术收藏，也是最独特的
This is the most splendid private collection of art I've ever seen, and the most unique:

91
00:07:17,227 --> 00:07:20,126
大部分是列奥纳多·达·芬奇的作品
the majority are the works of Leonardo da Vinci,

92
00:07:20,262 --> 00:07:21,680
文艺复兴时期
Renaissance period.

93
00:07:21,848 --> 00:07:24,510
雷金纳德·波拉克的部分作品，20世纪
some of the works of Reginald Pollack, 20th century,

94
00:07:24,673 --> 00:07:26,592
甚至有一把来自马库斯二号的轻机关枪
and even a Sten from Marcus II.

95
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:28,510
我终于见到了其他人类
At last I've seen other humans.

96
00:07:28,936 --> 00:07:30,216
其他男人
Other men.

97
00:07:30,547 --> 00:07:32,080
有一个不是人类
One is not human.

98
00:07:32,328 --> 00:07:33,481
瓦肯人
The Vulcan.

99
00:07:34,532 --> 00:07:36,050
原来那就是瓦肯人
So that is a Vulcan.

100
00:07:36,617 --> 00:07:39,391
我想和他讨论次维度物理
I'd like to discuss subdimensional physics with him.

101
00:07:39,789 --> 00:07:42,911
你已经把该领域你所知道的一切都教给了我，你说瓦肯人知道的更多
You've taught me all you know in the area and you say Vulcanís know more.

102
00:07:43,138 --> 00:07:46,321
即使他的智力既不如你，也不如我
Even he is not your intellectual equal, nor mine.

103
00:07:46,623 --> 00:07:47,767
让我见见他们
Let me meet them.

104
00:07:47,971 --> 00:07:51,812
他们自私、残暴，是人类群体的一部分
They are selfish, brutal, a part of the human community

105
00:07:51,812 --> 00:07:54,381
我拒绝与之为伍，并把你隔绝开来
which I rejected and from which I've shielded you.

106
00:07:55,085 --> 00:07:57,412
他们很快就会走的，让我见见他们
Soon they will be gone. Let me meet them.

107
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:04,048
蕾娜…
Rayna...

108
00:08:14,146 --> 00:08:15,782
你孤独过吗？
Have you been lonely?

109
00:08:17,555 --> 00:08:19,038
什么是孤独？
What is loneliness?

110
00:08:20,514 --> 00:08:22,306
是一种渴望
It is a thirst.

111
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:27,328
是一朵凋谢在沙漠中的花
It is a flower dying in the desert.

112
00:08:32,774 --> 00:08:36,414
弗林特，不要把这个机会从我身边夺走
Flint, don't take this opportunity away from me.

113
00:08:37,163 --> 00:08:38,718
它是如此令人兴奋
It's so exciting.

114
00:08:41,414 --> 00:08:42,942
令人兴奋？
Exciting?

115
00:08:44,823 --> 00:08:47,277
你以前从来没有对我提出过要求
You have never made a demand of me before.

116
00:08:49,614 --> 00:08:50,932
抱歉
I'm sorry.

117
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:55,992
不要觉得抱歉
Do not be sorry.

118
00:08:57,641 --> 00:08:59,852
可能会很有趣
It might be interesting.

119
00:09:06,066 --> 00:09:08,937
蜥牌白兰地，百年陈酿，来点吗吉姆？
Saurian brandy, 100 years old. Jim?

120
00:09:08,937 --> 00:09:09,820
当然
Please.

121
00:09:12,406 --> 00:09:14,771
史波克先生，我知道你不会喝的
Mr. Spock, I know you won't have one.

122
00:09:15,017 --> 00:09:18,037
天堂禁止那些数学上完美的脑电波
Heaven forbid those mathematically perfect brain waves

123
00:09:18,037 --> 00:09:21,037
被这种过于人性化的恶习所腐蚀
be corrupted by this all too human vice.

124
00:09:21,113 --> 00:09:23,545
谢谢，医生，我要一杯白兰地
Thank you, Doctor. I will have a brandy.

125
00:09:25,628 --> 00:09:28,168
你觉得我们俩能应付一个喝醉的瓦肯人吗？
Do you think the two of us can handle a drunk Vulcan?

126
00:09:28,363 --> 00:09:30,859
一旦酒精接触到绿色血液…
Once alcohol hits that green blood...

127
00:09:31,788 --> 00:09:35,467
如果我显得心不在焉，那是因为我所看到的
If I appear distracted, it is because of what I've seen.

128
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:39,691
我快要体验到一种不寻常的情绪了
I am close to experiencing an unaccustomed emotion.

129
00:09:42,031 --> 00:09:43,403
我要为此喝一杯
I'll drink to that.

130
00:09:45,939 --> 00:09:47,033
什么情绪？
What emotion?

131
00:09:47,169 --> 00:09:48,152
嫉妒
Envy.

132
00:09:49,085 --> 00:09:53,255
这些达芬奇画作都没有被编目或复制过
None of these da Vinci paintings has been cataloged or reproduced.

133
00:09:53,443 --> 00:09:54,936
它们是不知名的作品
They are unknown works,

134
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:59,446
从最后一笔抑或是材料的使用都明显是真迹
all apparently authentic to the last brushstroke and use of materials.

135
00:09:59,777 --> 00:10:02,635
未被发现的达芬奇本会是无价的
As undiscovered da Vinciís, they would be priceless.

136
00:10:02,748 --> 00:10:05,834
本会是？你是说你认为它们是赝品？
Would be? You mean you think they're fakes?

137
00:10:06,654 --> 00:10:11,590
真奇怪，一个像弗林特这样富有和无可挑剔的品味的人
Most strange. A man of Flint's obvious wealth and impeccable taste

138
00:10:11,757 --> 00:10:13,758
几乎不需要挂赝品
scarcely needs to hang fakes.

139
00:10:13,979 --> 00:10:19,135
然而我的三录仪分析表明，使用的画布和颜料
Yet my tricorder analysis indicates that the canvas and pigments used

140
00:10:19,321 --> 00:10:21,000
产自当代
are of contemporary origin.

141
00:10:23,978 --> 00:10:27,756
嗯，这可能就是它本来的样子
Well, this could be what it seems to be.

142
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:31,599
或者它可能是一个伪装，一个陷阱，甚至是一个幻觉
Or it could be a cover, a set up, or even an illusion.

143
00:10:31,802 --> 00:10:35,406
这可以解释这些画，类似于真实的东西
That could explain the paintings, similar to the real thing.

144
00:10:35,567 --> 00:10:39,951
史波克，尽早读取我们主人的完整三录仪数据，看看他是不是人类
Spock, at your earliest opportunity, take a full tricorder reading of our host. See if he's human.

145
00:10:41,485 --> 00:10:42,740
柯克呼叫企业号，斯科特先生？
Kirk to Enterprise. Mr. Scott?

146
00:10:42,766 --> 00:10:43,366
是的，舰长
Aye, Captain.

147
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:48,489
斯科特先生，对弗林特先生进行全面电脑检查
Mr. Scott, run a full computer check on Mr. Flint

148
00:10:48,565 --> 00:10:51,255
以及霍尔贝格917G这颗星球
and on this planet Holberg 917G.

149
00:10:51,422 --> 00:10:52,898
准备好你的结果，我会联系你的
Stand by with your results. I'll contact.

150
00:10:53,101 --> 00:10:53,701
是的，舰长
Aye, Captain.

151
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:54,356
通话完毕
Kirk out.

152
00:10:55,801 --> 00:10:59,973
让我们好好享用这杯白兰地，尝起来是真的
Let's enjoy this brandy. It tastes real.

153
00:11:06,354 --> 00:11:07,669
小心
Easy.

154
00:11:16,597 --> 00:11:17,487
老骨头？
Bones?

155
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,828
瑞他啉，准备处理为抗毒素
Ryetalyn, ready to be processed into antitoxin.

156
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:25,290
传送上船并开始处理
Beam up to the ship and start processing.

157
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,518
没必要，舰长
That will not be necessary, Captain.

158
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:33,547
在我的实验室，M-4可以比在船上更快地准备瑞他啉接种
M-4 can prepare the ryetalyn for inoculation more quickly in my laboratory than you could aboard your ship.

159
00:11:33,714 --> 00:11:35,821
当然，我想对此进行监督
I would like to supervise that, of course.

160
00:11:36,438 --> 00:11:40,859
当你对流程感到满意时，我希望你们能赏光和我一起吃晚餐
And when you are satisfied as to procedures, I hope you will do me the honour of being my guests at dinner.

161
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:44,205
谢谢，弗林特先生，我认为我们没有时间
Thank you, Mr. Flint. I don't think we have the time.

162
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:48,045
我后悔我早先的冷淡，让我来补偿一下
I regret my earlier inhospitality. Let me make amends.

163
00:12:10,158 --> 00:12:13,913
先生们，请让我介绍一下蕾娜
Gentlemen, may I present Rayna.

164
00:12:19,146 --> 00:12:21,774
我以为你一个人住
I thought you lived alone.

165
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:24,723
我的意思是除了我的家人没有其他人
I meant there are no others besides my family.

166
00:12:27,082 --> 00:12:28,388
麦考伊医生
Dr. McCoy.

167
00:12:30,008 --> 00:12:31,396
史波克先生
Mr. Spock.

168
00:12:32,424 --> 00:12:36,610
史波克先生，我希望我们能找个时间讨论场密度
Mr. Spock, I do hope we can find a moment to discuss field density

169
00:12:36,672 --> 00:12:39,296
以及它与重力现象的关系
and its relationship to gravity phenomena.

170
00:12:39,699 --> 00:12:43,218
是吗，我会很喜欢这样的讨论
Indeed. I would appreciate such a talk.

171
00:12:43,667 --> 00:12:45,376
这是我的兴趣所在
It is an interest of mine.

172
00:12:46,008 --> 00:12:47,288
柯克舰长
Captain Kirk.

173
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:49,959
柯克舰长？
Captain Kirk?

174
00:12:50,968 --> 00:12:51,834
蕾娜
Rayna.

175
00:12:52,189 --> 00:12:55,261
她的父母在我受雇期间在一次事故中丧生
Her parents were killed in an accident while in my employ.

176
00:12:55,691 --> 00:12:59,403
临死前，他们把孩子，也就是蕾娜·卡佩克，交给我看管
Before dying, they placed their infant, Rayna Kapec, in my custody.

177
00:12:59,758 --> 00:13:01,414
我抚养并教育了她
I have raised and educated her.

178
00:13:01,532 --> 00:13:03,635
令人印象深刻的成果，先生
With most impressive results, sir.

179
00:13:04,263 --> 00:13:07,724
除了重力现象，你还有什么感兴趣的，蕾娜？
What else interests you besides gravity phenomena, Rayna?

180
00:13:07,891 --> 00:13:11,228
所有东西，否则就是对智力的背叛
Everything. Less than that is betrayal of the intellect.

181
00:13:11,395 --> 00:13:14,997
整个宇宙？所有的知识？
The totality of the universe? All knowledge?

182
00:13:15,167 --> 00:13:20,571
蕾娜拥有 17 个大学科学和艺术学位
Rayna possesses 17 university degrees in the sciences and arts.

183
00:13:20,737 --> 00:13:23,200
她知道智力并不是全部
She is aware that the intellect is not all.

184
00:13:23,926 --> 00:13:27,911
但它的培养必须是第一位的，否则人就会出错
But its cultivation must come first, or the individual makes errors.

185
00:13:28,402 --> 00:13:30,646
在无意义的追求上浪费时间
Wastes time in unprofitable pursuits.

186
00:13:31,616 --> 00:13:35,586
我在她这个年纪的时候，相当喜欢犯无伤大雅的错误
At her age, I rather enjoyed errors with no noticeable damage,

187
00:13:35,966 --> 00:13:39,358
但我必须承认，你是我见过的最不像书呆子的人
But, I must admit, you're the farthest thing from a bookworm I've ever seen.

188
00:13:40,341 --> 00:13:44,798
弗林特是我的老师，你们是我见过的仅有的其他人
Flint is my teacher. You are the only other men I've ever seen.

189
00:13:44,887 --> 00:13:49,150
是全世界人的不幸，是我们的荣幸
The misfortune of men everywhere and our privilege.

190
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:56,392
如果你陪我的机器人去实验室，医生
If you will accompany my robot to the laboratory, doctor,

191
00:13:56,536 --> 00:13:59,592
你可以放心，瑞他啉正在处理中
you can rest assured that the ryetalyn is being processed.

192
00:13:59,953 --> 00:14:01,000
谢谢，先生
Thank you, sir.

193
00:14:04,865 --> 00:14:09,620
你们喜欢什么，先生们？象棋、台球、谈话？
Your pleasure, gentlemen? Chess, billiards, conversation?

194
00:14:12,122 --> 00:14:14,053
为什么不一起呢？
Why not all three?

195
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:01,417
你教过她吗？
Did you teach her that?

196
00:15:01,773 --> 00:15:02,714
我们经常玩
We play often.

197
00:15:02,943 --> 00:15:04,297
我能露一手吗，舰长？
May I show you, Captain?

198
00:15:11,765 --> 00:15:13,720
你提到了野蛮，弗林特先生
You said something about savagery, Mr. Flint.

199
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,227
你上次访问地球是什么时候？
When was the last time you visited earth?

200
00:15:15,394 --> 00:15:17,752
[弗林特] 你要告诉我它不再残酷了
[Flint] You would tell me it is no longer cruel.

201
00:15:18,272 --> 00:15:19,511
但它就是残酷的，舰长
But it is, Captain.

202
00:15:19,977 --> 00:15:22,025
看看你的星舰，满是武器
Look at your starship, bristling with weapons.

203
00:15:22,318 --> 00:15:25,997
它的使命是殖民、剥削、摧毁，如有必要
Its mission, to colonize, exploit, destroy, if necessary

204
00:15:25,997 --> 00:15:27,617
推进联邦事业
to advance Federation causes.

205
00:15:31,678 --> 00:15:32,560
谢谢
Thank you.

206
00:15:34,485 --> 00:15:36,597
我们的任务是和平的，我们的武器是防御性的
Our missions are peaceful, our weapons defensive.

207
00:15:36,961 --> 00:15:40,757
如果我们是野蛮人，我们就不会请求要瑞他啉
If we were barbarians, we would not have asked for ryetalyn.

208
00:15:41,166 --> 00:15:44,789
实际上，你的问候，而不是我们的问候，缺乏某种仁慈
Indeed, your greeting, not ours, lacked a certain benevolence.

209
00:15:45,982 --> 00:15:52,071
压力的结果不是你关心的
The result of pressures which are not your concern.

210
00:15:55,684 --> 00:16:00,689
是的，每个人都承受着这些无处不在的压力，促使他做出你所谓的野蛮行为
Yes. Well, those pressures are everywhere in everyone, urging him to what you call savagery.

211
00:16:00,856 --> 00:16:05,471
个人的地狱，内心的需求和奥秘，本能的野兽
The private hells, the inner needs and mysteries, the beast of instinct.

212
00:16:09,156 --> 00:16:12,767
作为人类，就是这样的
As human beings, that is the way it is.

213
00:16:12,937 --> 00:16:14,745
作为人类代表着复杂
To be human is to be complex.

214
00:16:14,802 --> 00:16:19,750
你无法避免来自内部和外部的一丁点缺陷
You can't avoid a little ugliness from within and from without.

215
00:16:19,881 --> 00:16:21,967
[钢琴演奏]
[Piano Plays]

216
00:16:26,927 --> 00:16:28,911
史波克先生，你为什么不演奏华尔兹？
Why don't you play the waltz, Mr. Spock?

217
00:16:31,345 --> 00:16:34,881
作为人类也意味着寻求快乐、欢笑、跳舞
To be human is also to seek pleasure, to laugh, to dance.

218
00:16:35,766 --> 00:16:37,780
蕾娜是一位有造诣的舞者
Rayna is a most accomplished dancer.

219
00:16:43,899 --> 00:16:45,292
我能有这个荣幸吗？
May I have the pleasure?

220
00:18:47,564 --> 00:18:48,552
有什么事吗？
Is something wrong?

221
00:18:48,687 --> 00:18:50,977
是的，有问题，瑞他啉有问题
Yes, there's something wrong. The ryetalyn is no good.

222
00:18:51,011 --> 00:18:53,684
它含有釴，接近千分之一
It contains irillium, nearly one part per thousand.

223
00:18:54,087 --> 00:18:58,213
釴会使抗毒素变得惰性和无用
Irillium will render the antitoxin inert and useless.

224
00:19:00,203 --> 00:19:02,315
真不幸之前没有发现
Most unfortunate that it was not detected.

225
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:07,243
我会和M-4一起去收集更多的瑞他啉并亲自筛选
I shall go with M-4 to gather more ryetalyn and screen it myself.

226
00:19:08,668 --> 00:19:10,196
欢迎你和我一起，医生
You're welcome to join me, Doctor.

227
00:19:10,562 --> 00:19:11,515
谢谢
Thank you.

228
00:19:12,172 --> 00:19:13,830
时间因素，老骨头？传染病
Time factor, Bones? Epidemic.

229
00:19:14,328 --> 00:19:17,279
接近两个半小时，我想我们有时间能及时赶上
Nearly two and a half hours. I guess we got time to get in under the wire.

230
00:19:17,597 --> 00:19:19,829
[麦考伊] 我从来没有见过比这机器人更快的
[McCoy]I've never seen anything like the speed of that robot.

231
00:19:19,829 --> 00:19:21,964
这将花费我们两倍的时间处理那个东西
It'd take us twice as long to process that stuff.

232
00:19:22,012 --> 00:19:23,259
[柯克] 但是要是我们弄错了怎么办？
[Kirk] But would we have made the error?

233
00:19:23,406 --> 00:19:26,267
吉姆，如果这个星球上所有的瑞他啉都含有釴怎么办？
Jim, what if all the ryetalyn on this planet contains irillium?

234
00:19:29,564 --> 00:19:32,651
和弗林特一起去，盯着整个流程
Go with Flint. Keep an eye on procedures.

235
00:19:33,165 --> 00:19:34,253
像一只鹰
Like a hawk.

236
00:19:34,528 --> 00:19:38,605
舰长，另一个相当非凡的东西
Captain, something else which is rather extraordinary.

237
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:43,245
我刚刚演奏的这首华尔兹是约翰内斯·勃拉姆斯的
This waltz I just played is by Johannes Brahms.

238
00:19:43,563 --> 00:19:44,407
等会儿，史波克
Later, Spock.

239
00:19:44,623 --> 00:19:47,351
舰长，这是原始手稿
Captain, it is written in manuscript.

240
00:19:48,298 --> 00:19:52,010
勃拉姆斯亲手写的原始手稿，我认出来了
In original manuscript in Brahms' own hand, which I recognize.

241
00:19:52,354 --> 00:19:56,618
完全不为人知，绝对是勃拉姆斯的作品
It is totally unknown, definitely the work of Brahms,

242
00:19:57,923 --> 00:20:00,542
并且不为人知
and yet unknown.

243
00:20:00,912 --> 00:20:02,195
我要去实验室
I think I will go to the laboratory.

244
00:20:02,283 --> 00:20:05,894
也许有方法可以逆转釴的作用，并保住现有的抗毒素
There may be a way of reversing the irillium's effect and saving the existing antitoxin.

245
00:20:06,169 --> 00:20:09,950
待在这，让我知道弗林特和麦考伊什么时候回来
Stay here. Let me know when Flint and McCoy return.

246
00:20:40,727 --> 00:20:44,951
[柯克]舰长日志，星历5843.75
[Kirk] Captain's log, stardate 5843.75.

247
00:20:46,225 --> 00:20:49,390
我是否错误听信了弗林特的话？
Have I committed a grave error in accepting Flint's word

248
00:20:49,419 --> 00:20:51,275
他说会把解药交给我们
that he would deliver the antidote to us?

249
00:20:52,326 --> 00:20:57,190
我所浪费的宝贵时间可能会给企业号及其船员带来灾难
The precious time I have let past may result in disaster for the Enterprise and her crew.

250
00:21:28,642 --> 00:21:31,603
你离开了我们，房间变得孤独
You left us. The room became lonely.

251
00:21:32,968 --> 00:21:33,836
是一种口渴
It is a thirst.

252
00:21:35,259 --> 00:21:36,983
一朵花在沙漠中死去
A flower dying in the desert.

253
00:21:37,297 --> 00:21:38,193
什么？
What?

254
00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:51,304
里面有什么？
What's in there?

255
00:21:51,824 --> 00:21:53,166
我不知道
I do not know.

256
00:21:54,133 --> 00:21:55,830
弗林特告诉我永远别进去
Flint told me never to enter.

257
00:21:56,501 --> 00:21:58,046
他不拒绝我别的事情
He denies me nothing else.

258
00:21:58,347 --> 00:21:59,443
那你为什么在这里？
Then why are you here?

259
00:22:02,139 --> 00:22:03,475
我不知道
I do not know.

260
00:22:04,941 --> 00:22:06,900
我烦恼的时候来这里
I come here when I am troubled.

261
00:22:08,181 --> 00:22:11,539
找寻自我的时候
When I would search myself.

262
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:13,971
你现在烦恼吗？
Are you troubled now?

263
00:22:15,374 --> 00:22:16,259
是的
Yes.

264
00:22:17,299 --> 00:22:18,217
因为什么？
By what?

265
00:22:34,511 --> 00:22:38,901
你和弗林特一起住这里开心吗？
Are you happy here with Flint?

266
00:22:40,088 --> 00:22:43,189
他是银河系中最伟大、最善良、最聪明的人
He is the greatest, kindest, wisest man in the galaxy.

267
00:22:45,055 --> 00:22:46,274
那你为什么害怕？
Then why are you afraid?

268
00:23:11,466 --> 00:23:12,746
不要害怕
Don't be afraid.

269
00:24:03,309 --> 00:24:04,665
终止命令
Stop command.

270
00:24:10,037 --> 00:24:11,057
终止
Stop.

271
00:24:24,692 --> 00:24:25,886
谢谢你，史波克先生
Thank you, Mr. Spock.

272
00:24:27,539 --> 00:24:30,217
幸好机器人没有发现我的存在
Fortunately, the robot did not detect my presence

273
00:24:30,217 --> 00:24:31,753
并解除我的相位枪
and deactivate my phaser.

274
00:24:49,343 --> 00:24:53,119
M-4被设计用来保护这个家庭及其成员
M-4 was programmed to defend this household and its members.

275
00:24:53,434 --> 00:24:55,421
毫无疑问，我应该修改它的指令
No doubt I should have altered its instructions

276
00:24:55,421 --> 00:24:58,480
来允许你采取未经授权但可预测的行动
to allow for unauthorized but predictable actions on your part.

277
00:24:59,301 --> 00:25:01,036
它以为你在攻击蕾娜
It thought you were attacking Rayna.

278
00:25:01,323 --> 00:25:02,349
一个误解
A misinterpretation.

279
00:25:02,642 --> 00:25:05,129
如果它现在就在身边，它会纠正…
If it were around right now, it would correct...

280
00:25:14,476 --> 00:25:17,804
非常有用不可或缺的设备，真的，我还做了一个
Too useful a device to be without, really. I created another.

281
00:25:18,866 --> 00:25:21,516
它现在将前往实验室并与麦考伊医生会合
It will now go to the laboratory and join Dr. McCoy.

282
00:25:26,210 --> 00:25:27,036
真有意思
Fascinating.

283
00:25:27,294 --> 00:25:29,687
幸亏你没有攻击我，舰长
Be thankful that you did not attack me, Captain.

284
00:25:30,236 --> 00:25:33,436
否则我大概已经接受了战斗，我的体力是你的两倍
I might have accepted battle and I have twice your physical strength.

285
00:25:34,322 --> 00:25:37,532
用你自己的话来说，这将是一次“有趣的权力测试”
In your own words, it would be an "interesting test of power."

286
00:25:39,058 --> 00:25:40,646
他真是孩子气啊，蕾娜
How childish he is, Rayna.

287
00:25:41,713 --> 00:25:44,252
你会称他为勇敢还是傻瓜？
Would you call him brave or a fool?

288
00:25:47,234 --> 00:25:50,695
我很高兴他没有死
I'm glad he did not die.

289
00:25:51,074 --> 00:25:55,658
当然，死亡，在不必要的时候，是一件悲惨的事情
Of course. Death, when unnecessary, is a tragic thing.

290
00:25:57,491 --> 00:25:59,923
麦考伊医生和新的瑞他啉在实验室里
[Flint] Dr. McCoy's in the laboratory with the new ryetalyn.

291
00:26:00,093 --> 00:26:01,907
他对它的质量很满意
He's satisfied with its quality.

292
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:06,336
我可以建议你在这里耐心、安全地等待吗？
May I suggest that you wait here patiently, safely?

293
00:26:07,295 --> 00:26:10,214
你已经见识过了，我的防御系统自动运行
You have seen that my defense systems operate automatically

294
00:26:10,611 --> 00:26:13,619
并不总是按照我的意愿
and not always in accordance with my wishes.

295
00:26:15,553 --> 00:26:16,481
来吧，蕾娜
Come, Rayna.

296
00:26:22,982 --> 00:26:24,078
蕾娜
Rayna.

297
00:26:30,443 --> 00:26:31,299
来
Come.

298
00:26:35,782 --> 00:26:38,534
我不喜欢他命令她的方式
I don't like the way he orders her around.

299
00:26:39,504 --> 00:26:43,408
既然我们依靠弗林特先生来提供瑞他啉，舰长
Since we are dependent on Mr. Flint for the ryetalyn, Captain,

300
00:26:43,982 --> 00:26:47,961
我恭敬地建议你少关注些这位小姐
may I respectfully suggest that you pay less attention to the young lady

301
00:26:48,127 --> 00:26:49,645
如果你再次遇到她的话
if you should encounter her again.

302
00:26:50,043 --> 00:26:54,116
我们东道主的兴趣似乎不仅限于艺术和科学
Our host's interests do not appear to be confined to art and science.

303
00:26:57,616 --> 00:27:00,870
他爱她？
He loves her?

304
00:27:01,431 --> 00:27:02,913
表现得很明显
Strongly indicated.

305
00:27:03,283 --> 00:27:04,056
妒忌
Jealousy.

306
00:27:08,731 --> 00:27:12,380
是的，这可以解释这次袭击
Yes, that would explain the attack,

307
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:15,146
但他似乎希望我们在一起
but he seemed to want us together.

308
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:16,846
台球比赛
The billiard game.

309
00:27:17,796 --> 00:27:18,980
他建议我们跳舞
He suggested we dance.

310
00:27:19,794 --> 00:27:23,058
据我所知，它似乎确实违背了男性的逻辑
It does appear to defy the male logic, as I understand it.

311
00:27:28,586 --> 00:27:29,993
柯克呼叫企业号，斯科特先生
Kirk to Enterprise. Mr. Scott.

312
00:27:30,204 --> 00:27:30,884
是的，舰长
Aye, Captain

313
00:27:31,382 --> 00:27:32,909
关于瑞吉利热的报告
Report on the Rigelian fever.

314
00:27:33,111 --> 00:27:35,155
船上几乎每个人都感染了，舰长
Nearly everybody aboard has got it, Captain.

315
00:27:35,258 --> 00:27:37,876
我们正在组建一个骨干团队，并等待瑞他啉
We're working a skeleton crew and waiting for the ryetalyn.

316
00:27:37,922 --> 00:27:39,676
[柯克] 再等一会儿，斯科提
[Kirk] Just a little while longer, Scotty.

317
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:42,124
计算机检索报告
Report on the computer search.

318
00:27:43,233 --> 00:27:45,396
没有关于弗林特先生的报道
There's no report on Mr. Flint.

319
00:27:45,672 --> 00:27:47,654
他似乎没有任何过去
He doesn't seem to have any past.

320
00:27:48,901 --> 00:27:52,101
这颗星球是30年前被布拉克先生买下的
The planet was purchased 30 years ago by a Mr. Brack,

321
00:27:52,567 --> 00:27:54,341
一个富有的金融家和隐士
a wealthy financier and recluse.

322
00:27:54,986 --> 00:27:57,989
用电脑检查蕾娜·卡佩克
Run a computer check on Rayna Kapec.

323
00:27:58,596 --> 00:28:01,163
身份，父母去世后的合法监护人
Status, legal ward after the death of her parents.

324
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:02,329
是的，长官
Aye, sir.

325
00:28:03,232 --> 00:28:04,628
通话完毕，斯科特先生
Kirk out, Mr. Scott.

326
00:28:06,508 --> 00:28:08,214
我们还有一个更大的谜团，舰长
We have still a greater mystery, Captain.

327
00:28:09,452 --> 00:28:12,106
我能用三录仪对弗林特先生进行扫描
I was able to run a tricorder scan on Mr. Flint.

328
00:28:12,329 --> 00:28:16,560
他是人类，但某些生物物理特性
He is human, but there are certain biophysical peculiarities,

329
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:19,509
一些身体机能读数不成比例
some body-function readings are disproportionate.

330
00:28:19,936 --> 00:28:26,278
比如，显示了极端年龄，大约为6,000年
For one thing, extreme age is indicated, on the order of 6,000 years.

331
00:28:27,251 --> 00:28:28,787
史波克先生，你能确认一下吗？
Can you confirm that, Mr. Spock?

332
00:28:29,156 --> 00:28:32,263
我将通过麦考伊医生的医疗计算机对读数进行编程
I shall program the readings through Dr. McCoy's medical computer

333
00:28:32,556 --> 00:28:33,634
当我们回到船上时
when we return to the ship.

334
00:28:34,202 --> 00:28:34,894
时间因素？
Time factor?

335
00:28:35,099 --> 00:28:38,696
我们必须在两小时十八分钟内开始注射瑞他啉
We must commence ryetalyn injections within two hours and 18 minutes,

336
00:28:38,974 --> 00:28:41,470
否则这场流行病对我们所有人来说都是致命的
or the epidemic will prove fatal to us all.

337
00:28:44,202 --> 00:28:46,245
现在是什么在进行处理？
What's keeping the processing this time?

338
00:28:46,435 --> 00:28:47,769
耽搁可能是故意的
The delay may be deliberate.

339
00:28:48,527 --> 00:28:51,084
好像他出于某种原因把我们留在这里
As though he was keeping us here for some reason.

340
00:28:51,423 --> 00:28:55,748
真有趣，我们的主人似乎希望我们逗留
Most interesting. Our host appears to wish us to linger,

341
00:28:55,936 --> 00:28:58,474
然而他很担心
yet he is apprehensive.

342
00:28:59,775 --> 00:29:02,762
我们很可能被监视了
It is logical to assume that we are being monitored

343
00:29:02,858 --> 00:29:05,471
而且他知道我们的一举一动
and that he is aware of our every move.

344
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:13,144
你派机器人去杀了他
You sent the robot to kill him.

345
00:29:14,317 --> 00:29:16,024
它是来保护你的
It came to protect you.

346
00:29:16,644 --> 00:29:19,445
我的思维并没有召唤它，我不害怕
My mind could not have summoned it. I was not frightened.

347
00:29:19,633 --> 00:29:22,131
那么它是有缺陷的，我会自己摧毁它
It was defective, then. I would have destroyed it myself.

348
00:29:24,287 --> 00:29:25,365
我骗过你吗？
Have I lied to you?

349
00:29:27,346 --> 00:29:28,304
从没
Never.

350
00:29:28,870 --> 00:29:32,725
相信我说的话，我不希望柯克舰长死
Believe what I say. I would not want Captain Kirk dead.

351
00:29:34,696 --> 00:29:35,925
你有什么感觉？
What did you feel?

352
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:42,107
你会让他们拿到瑞他啉吗？
You'll let them have the ryetalyn?

353
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:43,693
是的
Yes.

354
00:29:44,942 --> 00:29:47,392
如果你愿意，去找他们，和他们告别
Go to them if you wish. Say your farewells.

355
00:29:55,088 --> 00:29:55,790
我是柯克
Kirk here.

356
00:29:56,090 --> 00:29:57,039
我是斯科特先生，长官
Mr. Scott, sir.

357
00:29:57,526 --> 00:30:00,761
联邦司法库中没有蕾娜·卡佩克的记录
There's no record of a Rayna Kapec in Federation legal banks.

358
00:30:02,379 --> 00:30:03,489
没有监护人？
No ward of custody?

359
00:30:03,850 --> 00:30:06,754
任何电脑库中都没有背景资料
No background in any computer banks.

360
00:30:07,132 --> 00:30:08,279
和弗林特一样
Like Flint.

361
00:30:08,645 --> 00:30:09,570
通话完毕
Kirk out.

362
00:30:11,414 --> 00:30:13,509
"和弗林特一样"
"Like Flint."

363
00:30:14,189 --> 00:30:15,512
没有过去的人
People without a past.

364
00:30:16,006 --> 00:30:18,425
他对她有什么影响？
What hold does he have over her?

365
00:30:18,667 --> 00:30:23,050
舰长，我想说眼下我们最关心的是瑞他啉
Captain, I would suggest our immediate concern is the ryetalyn.

366
00:30:28,181 --> 00:30:29,129
让我们找到麦考伊
Let's find McCoy.

367
00:30:31,228 --> 00:30:31,996
舰长
Captain.

368
00:30:38,572 --> 00:30:39,940
我和你在实验室碰头
I'll meet you in the lab.

369
00:30:45,389 --> 00:30:46,842
我是来告别的
I've come to say goodbye.

370
00:30:47,504 --> 00:30:49,076
我不想说再见
I don't want to say goodbye.

371
00:31:56,811 --> 00:32:01,590
最后一次温柔的邂逅，柯克舰长，结束你的作用
A last tender encounter, Captain Kirk, to end your usefulness.

372
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:07,103
我告诉你，史波克，我在等机器人完成处理
I tell you, Spock, I was waiting for the robot to finish the processing

373
00:32:07,223 --> 00:32:10,101
接着我知道的就是它就不见了，瑞他啉也是
and the next thing I knew it was gone and so was the ryetalyn.

374
00:32:10,382 --> 00:32:11,209
有趣
Interesting.

375
00:32:11,625 --> 00:32:14,766
显然，弗林特先生还没有准备好让我们离开
Obviously, Mr. Flint is not yet ready for us to depart.

376
00:32:15,246 --> 00:32:16,712
嗯，我想最好告诉吉姆
Well, I think we'd better tell Jim.

377
00:32:16,771 --> 00:32:18,958
舰长要我们在这里等
The captain wanted us to wait here.

378
00:32:19,125 --> 00:32:20,296
跟我走
Come with me.

379
00:32:21,466 --> 00:32:24,719
…我给你幸福
...I offer you happiness.

380
00:32:25,311 --> 00:32:27,990
我了解这里的安保措施
I've known security here.

381
00:32:28,265 --> 00:32:29,519
童年必须结束
Childhood must end.

382
00:32:30,633 --> 00:32:32,690
你爱我，而不是弗林特
You love me, not Flint.

383
00:32:48,803 --> 00:32:51,043
弗林特撒谎，瑞他啉不在这里
Flint lied. The ryetalyn isn't here.

384
00:32:51,452 --> 00:32:53,072
收到三录仪读数，舰长
Picking up tricorder readings, Captain.

385
00:32:54,007 --> 00:32:55,955
显然，瑞他啉在这扇门后面
Apparently, the ryetalyn is behind this door.

386
00:33:08,215 --> 00:33:09,990
为什么弗林特要对我们耍花招？
Why is Flint playing tricks on us?

387
00:33:13,512 --> 00:33:18,351
显然，如果可以的话，我们应该进去拿它
Apparently, we're supposed to go in and get it if we can.

388
00:33:19,603 --> 00:33:21,907
让我们不要让象棋大师失望
Let's not disappoint the chess master.

389
00:33:22,874 --> 00:33:24,087
相位枪全功率
Phasers on full.

390
00:33:29,487 --> 00:33:32,510
舰长，我去拿瑞他啉
Captain, I shall get the ryetalyn.

391
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:34,831
为什么是你？
Why you?

392
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:37,354
里面可能有危险
There may be dangers within.

393
00:33:39,205 --> 00:33:40,129
让我们去看看
Let's find out.

394
00:33:40,187 --> 00:33:41,409
让我一个人去吧，舰长
Let me go alone, Captain.

395
00:33:41,958 --> 00:33:46,254
为什么？说重点，史波克，如果有的话
Why? Get to the point, Spock, if there is one.

396
00:33:48,933 --> 00:33:50,113
我们一起去
We'll all go.

397
00:34:13,072 --> 00:34:14,306
瑞他啉
The ryetalyn.

[柯克]舰长日志，星历5843.8
[Kirk] Captain's log, stardate 5843.8.

399
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:22,155
我们已经有了用于在企业号上抗击疫情的瑞他啉
We have the ryetalyn ready to combat the epidemic aboard the Enterprise.

400
00:35:23,035 --> 00:35:25,739
但我们也发现了捐助者的秘密
But we have also discovered our benefactor's secret.

401
00:35:26,698 --> 00:35:29,643
他创造了完美的女人
He has created the perfect woman.

402
00:35:31,076 --> 00:35:34,829
她唯一的缺点是她不是人类
Her only flaw she's not human.

403
00:35:40,689 --> 00:35:43,531
肉体上是人，但不是人
Physically human, but not human.

404
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:46,380
这些是蕾娜的早期版本，吉姆
These are earlier versions of Rayna, Jim.

405
00:35:47,394 --> 00:35:48,395
她是机器人
She's an android.

406
00:35:49,210 --> 00:35:51,846
我亲手在这里创造的
Created here by my hand.

407
00:35:56,965 --> 00:35:59,290
几个世纪的孤独将在这里结束
Here the centuries of loneliness were to end.

408
00:35:59,428 --> 00:36:02,515
弗林特先生，你收藏的列奥纳多·达·芬奇杰作
Your collection of Leonardo da Vinci masterpieces, Mr. Flint,

409
00:36:03,413 --> 00:36:05,518
似乎是最近画的

你钢琴上的约翰内斯·勃拉姆斯的华尔兹

412
00:36:14,373 --> 00:36:19,310
一部未知的作品，以现代墨水书写的手稿

413
00:36:19,402 --> 00:36:23,036

414
00:36:25,873 --> 00:36:28,862
我就是勃拉姆斯

415
00:36:33,709 --> 00:36:35,005
也是达芬奇？
And da Vinci?

416
00:36:35,532 --> 00:36:36,329
是的
Yes.

417
00:36:36,951 --> 00:36:39,703
你还有多少个别的名字？
How many other names shall we call you?

所罗门、亚历山大、拉撒路、玛士撒拉、梅林、艾布拉姆森

420
00:36:47,657 --> 00:36:48,515
你出生在？

地球上那个后来被称为美索不达米亚的地区

423
00:36:55,396 --> 00:36:57,380
正如千年来所认为的那样

00:37:02,072 --> 00:37:05,016
一个士兵，一个恶霸和一个傻瓜

00:37:06,444 --> 00:37:11,672
我在战斗中倒下，刺穿了心脏，并没有死去

427
00:37:12,543 --> 00:37:14,336
即时组织再生

00:37:14,488 --> 00:37:17,689
再加上一些完美的生物再生形式

00:37:19,011 --> 00:37:20,623
你知道了你是不死的…
You learned that you're immortal...

430
00:37:20,699 --> 00:37:21,818
并隐瞒了它
And to conceal it.

431
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:24,556
过着生活的一部分
To live some portion of a life.

432
00:37:26,232 --> 00:37:29,886
在我的天性被怀疑之前假装变老然后继续前进
To pretend to age and then move on before my nature was suspected.

433
00:37:30,439 --> 00:37:35,966
你的财富和智力是几个世纪以来积累的产物
Your wealth and your intellect are the product of centuries of acquisition.

434
00:37:37,286 --> 00:37:39,463
你认识历史上最伟大的杰出人物
You knew the greatest minds in history.

435
00:37:40,457 --> 00:37:43,518
伽利略、苏格拉底、摩西
Galileo, Socrates, Moses.

436
00:37:44,729 --> 00:37:46,686
我已经结了100次婚了，舰长
I have married 100 times, Captain.

437
00:37:47,161 --> 00:37:49,350
选择过，爱过，珍视过
Selected, loved, cherished,

438
00:37:50,422 --> 00:37:51,870
抚摸过光滑的肌肤
caressed a smoothness,

439
00:37:52,374 --> 00:37:53,959
闻到过短暂的芬芳
inhaled a brief fragrance.

440
00:37:55,002 --> 00:38:02,034
然后是衰老，死亡，尘土的味道，你明白吗？
Then age, death, the taste of dust. Do you understand?

441
00:38:04,018 --> 00:38:06,706
你想要一个完美的、最好的女人
You wanted a perfect, ultimate woman,

442
00:38:07,848 --> 00:38:12,519
像你自己一样才华横溢，不朽
as brilliant, as immortal, as yourself.

443
00:38:14,146 --> 00:38:16,515
你永远的伴侣
Your mate for all time.

444
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:21,571
我用心设计，对她的爱无法更甚
Designed by my heart. I could not love her more.

445
00:38:22,029 --> 00:38:24,365
史波克，你早就知道了？
Spock, you knew?

446
00:38:25,407 --> 00:38:26,867
我希望我错了
I'd hoped I was wrong.

447
00:38:26,957 --> 00:38:29,200
你不能爱一个机器人，舰长，我爱她
You cannot love an android, Captain. I love her.

448
00:38:29,423 --> 00:38:33,096
她是我的杰作，我的所有，她就是我想要的
She is my handiwork, my property. She is what I desire.

449
00:38:33,347 --> 00:38:34,696
你带我来就是让我知道这事？
You brought me here to learn this?

450
00:38:37,002 --> 00:38:37,958
她知道吗？
Does she know?

451
00:38:38,181 --> 00:38:39,302
她永远不会知道
She will never know.

452
00:38:40,893 --> 00:38:41,644
我们走吧
Let's go.

453
00:38:41,685 --> 00:38:42,694
你会留下来
You will stay.

454
00:38:44,929 --> 00:38:45,849
为什么？
Why?

455
00:38:46,171 --> 00:38:48,474
我们已经发现了他的身份，舰长
We have discovered what he is, Captain.

456
00:38:48,915 --> 00:38:51,347
如果你离开，好奇的人就会接踵而至
If you leave, the curious would follow.

457
00:38:51,453 --> 00:38:53,949
愚蠢的人、爱管闲事的人、官员、探索者
The foolish, the meddlers, the officials, the seekers.

458
00:38:54,947 --> 00:38:56,717
我的隐私是我自己的
My privacy was my own.

459
00:38:57,065 --> 00:38:58,647
对它的侵犯算在你的头上
Its invasion be on your head.

460
00:38:58,899 --> 00:39:00,375
我们可以保持沉默
We can remain silent.

461
00:39:01,284 --> 00:39:04,292
干涉的灾难，我知道的，我不会冒险的
The disaster of intervention, I've known it. I will not risk it.

462
00:39:05,743 --> 00:39:06,494
柯克呼叫企业号
Kirk to Enterprise.

463
00:39:10,577 --> 00:39:13,418
撤离该区域，通知星际舰队司令部
Clear out of the area. Inform Starfleet Command.

464
00:39:14,537 --> 00:39:17,196
企业号？斯科提？
Enterprise? Scotty?

465
00:39:18,041 --> 00:39:19,676
他们无法回答，舰长
They cannot answer, Captain.

466
00:39:42,242 --> 00:39:43,350
我的船员
My crew.

467
00:39:43,493 --> 00:39:44,566
权力测试
The test of power.

468
00:39:44,718 --> 00:39:45,826
你没有机会
You had no chance.

469
00:39:50,795 --> 00:39:52,779
是时候加入你的船员了
It is time for you to join your crew.

470
00:39:52,859 --> 00:39:55,706
你要消灭400条生命？为什么？
You'd wipe out 400 lives? Why?

471
00:39:55,978 --> 00:40:00,252
我见证过1000亿次的死亡，我比任何人都了解它
I have seen 100 billion fall. I know death better than any man.

472
00:40:00,384 --> 00:40:02,560
我已经把敌人扔到他的手里了
I have tossed enemies into his grasp.

473
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:08,896
我懂得怜悯，你的船员没有死，而是被暂停了
And I know mercy. Your crew is not dead, but suspended.

474
00:40:09,053 --> 00:40:12,317
比死亡还糟糕，恢复它们，恢复我的船
Worse than dead. Restore them. Restore my ship.

475
00:40:12,848 --> 00:40:17,963
早晚，1000年，2000年，你会知道未来的，柯克舰长
In time. 1,000, 2,000 years. You will know the future, Captain Kirk.

476
00:40:18,151 --> 00:40:19,894
你就是这样的人
You have been such men.

477
00:40:20,725 --> 00:40:22,941
你知道并创造了这样的美好
You've known and created such beauty.

478
00:40:23,596 --> 00:40:27,946
在你漫长的一生中，你见证了你的种族从野蛮进化而来
You've watched your race evolve from barbarism throughout your enormous life,

479
00:40:27,946 --> 00:40:29,698
然而你会这样对我们吗？
and yet now you would do this to us?

480
00:40:29,956 --> 00:40:33,577
我过去的美好，我现在的烦恼
The flowers of my past. I hold the nettles of the present.

481
00:40:33,682 --> 00:40:35,379
我现在是弗林特，有我的需要
I am Flint now, with my needs.

482
00:40:35,445 --> 00:40:36,595
什么需要
What needs?

483
00:40:37,164 --> 00:40:42,419
今晚我看到了一些奇妙的东西，我等待，我为之努力的东西
Tonight I've seen something wondrous, something I've waited for, labored for.

484
00:40:42,711 --> 00:40:43,948
不能有东西危及它
Nothing must endanger it.

485
00:40:44,477 --> 00:40:47,148
蕾娜的情绪终于有了波动
At last Rayna's emotions have stirred.

486
00:40:47,716 --> 00:40:50,604
现在这些情绪将在我保留的孤寂之地中投向我
Now they will turn to me in this solitude which I preserve.

487
00:40:51,251 --> 00:40:52,089
不
No.

488
00:40:54,206 --> 00:40:55,166
蕾娜
Rayna.

489
00:40:55,604 --> 00:40:57,326
你不能这么对他们
You must not do this to them.

490
00:40:57,537 --> 00:40:58,394
我一定要
I must.

491
00:40:59,397 --> 00:41:01,688
我们走了之后，你会对他有什么感觉？
What will you feel for him after we are gone?

492
00:41:09,571 --> 00:41:12,199
弗林特先生，所有情感都在起作用
All emotions are in play, Mr. Flint.

493
00:41:12,436 --> 00:41:14,420
你伤害我们，她恨你
You harm us, she hates you.

494
00:41:17,733 --> 00:41:21,313
把我的船还给我，我们不会泄露你的秘密
Give me back my ship. Your secret is safe with us.

495
00:41:42,842 --> 00:41:45,007
这就是为什么你推迟了瑞他啉的处理
That's why you delayed the processing of the ryetalyn.

496
00:41:50,091 --> 00:41:51,410
你意识到发生了什么
You realized what was happening.

497
00:41:51,694 --> 00:41:54,271
你让我们在一起，蕾娜和我
You kept us together, Rayna and me.

498
00:41:57,911 --> 00:42:00,439
因为你知道我可以让她的情感活跃起来
Because you knew I could bring her emotions alive.

499
00:42:05,643 --> 00:42:07,627
而现在你要夺走？
Now you're just going to take over?

500
00:42:08,295 --> 00:42:11,843
当她来找我时，我会拿走属于我的东西
I shall take what is mine, when she comes to me.

501
00:42:13,149 --> 00:42:15,319
我们是一对，舰长，一样的，不朽的
We are mated, Captain. Alike, immortal.

502
00:42:16,150 --> 00:42:19,000
你必须忘记你在这件事上的感觉，这对你来说是完全不可能的
You must forget your feelings in this matter, which is quite impossible for you.

503
00:42:19,112 --> 00:42:19,944
不可能！
Impossible!

504
00:42:21,064 --> 00:42:21,875
不可能
Impossible.

505
00:42:23,623 --> 00:42:25,523
从一开始，你就利用了我
From the beginning, you used me.

506
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:34,499
我不能爱她
I can't love her.

507
00:42:36,742 --> 00:42:37,931
但我确实爱她
But I do love her.

508
00:42:42,632 --> 00:42:43,628
她也爱我
And she loves me.

509
00:42:43,931 --> 00:42:45,026
不！
No!

510
00:42:47,374 --> 00:42:50,714
舰长，你的原始冲动不会改变状况
Captain, your primitive impulses will not alter the circumstances.

511
00:42:50,881 --> 00:42:52,360
别插手，我们为一个女人而战
Stay out of this. We're fighting over a woman.

512
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:54,408
不，你们不是，因为她不是
No, you're not, for she is not.

513
00:43:10,067 --> 00:43:13,195
我不能成为这件事的起因
I cannot be the cause of this.

514
00:43:14,696 --> 00:43:18,123
我不会成为这件事的起因
I will not be the cause of this.

515
00:43:24,619 --> 00:43:26,283
请停下
Please stop.

516
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:30,175
停！
Stop!

517
00:43:31,182 --> 00:43:35,156
我选择我想去的地方
I choose where I want to go.

518
00:43:36,399 --> 00:43:37,807
我想做的事
What I want to do.

519
00:43:39,941 --> 00:43:41,263
我来选择
I choose.

520
00:43:47,187 --> 00:43:49,992
我来选择
I choose.

521
00:43:50,191 --> 00:43:50,890
蕾娜！
Rayna!

522
00:43:51,292 --> 00:43:51,965
不
No,

523
00:43:54,016 --> 00:43:55,612
不要命令我
do not order me.

524
00:43:58,185 --> 00:44:00,480
没有人可以命令我
No one can order me.

525
00:44:01,568 --> 00:44:02,336
她是人类
She's human.

526
00:44:04,820 --> 00:44:07,165
哪怕只有最后一个血细胞，她都是人类
Down to the last blood cell, she's human.

527
00:44:07,808 --> 00:44:12,416
哪怕只剩最后的想法，希望，抱负，情感，她都是人
Down to the last thought, hope, aspiration, emotion, she's human.

528
00:44:14,278 --> 00:44:18,077
人类精神是自由的，你没有所有权
The human spirit is free. You have no power of ownership.

529
00:44:19,553 --> 00:44:20,966
她可以随心所欲
She's free to do as she wishes.

530
00:44:21,197 --> 00:44:23,526
先生们，我劝你们停下来
Gentlemen, I urge you to stop.

531
00:44:23,807 --> 00:44:24,950
有危险
There is a danger.

532
00:44:25,082 --> 00:44:26,230
没有人能打败我
No man beats me.

533
00:44:27,984 --> 00:44:29,059
我不想打败你
I don't want to beat you.

534
00:44:30,938 --> 00:44:33,287
这不是对权力测试
This is no test of power.

535
00:44:34,282 --> 00:44:35,674
蕾娜属于她自己
Rayna belongs to herself.

536
00:44:36,776 --> 00:44:40,230
她要求拥有人类选择的权利
And she claims the human right of choice,

537
00:44:40,991 --> 00:44:45,328
成为她想成为的
to be as she wills.

538
00:44:45,693 --> 00:44:48,125
做她想做的，想她所想的！
To do as she wills, to think as she wills!

539
00:44:49,374 --> 00:44:51,240
这就是我一直努力的东西
That's what I've worked for.

540
00:44:54,861 --> 00:44:58,442
蕾娜跟我走
Rayna come with me.

541
00:45:02,419 --> 00:45:03,165
留下
Stay.

542
00:45:11,798 --> 00:45:18,871
我本来不是人类
I was not human.

543
00:45:21,573 --> 00:45:27,787
现在我爱恋
Now I love.

544
00:45:31,783 --> 00:45:34,745
我爱恋
I love.

545
00:45:52,282 --> 00:45:54,742
你不能死
You can't die.

546
00:46:01,140 --> 00:46:01,833
发生了什么？
What happened?

547
00:46:01,912 --> 00:46:03,305
她爱你，舰长
She loved you, Captain.

548
00:46:05,691 --> 00:46:10,491
你也是，弗林特先生，作为导师，甚至作为父亲
And you, too, Mr. Flint, as a mentor, even as a father.

549
00:46:11,790 --> 00:46:16,044
她没有足够的时间适应这可怕的力量
There was not enough time for her to adjust to the awful power

550
00:46:16,086 --> 00:46:18,518
以及她新发现的情感的矛盾
and contradictions of her new-found emotions.

551
00:46:19,938 --> 00:46:22,009
她不忍伤害你们任何一个
She could not bear to hurt either of you.

552
00:46:24,298 --> 00:46:30,314
爱的快乐使她成为人，爱的痛苦摧毁了她
The joys of love made her human and the agonies of love destroyed her.

553
00:46:48,411 --> 00:46:49,216
史波克
Spock.

554
00:46:51,328 --> 00:46:54,144
疫情减轻，不再构成威胁了
The epidemic is reduced and no longer a threat.

555
00:46:54,875 --> 00:46:58,843
企业号在航线513，标记7，按照你的命令
The Enterprise is on course 513, mark 7, as you ordered.

556
00:47:02,150 --> 00:47:06,590
一个很老很孤独的人
A very old and lonely man.

557
00:47:08,924 --> 00:47:12,286
还有一个年轻而孤独的人
And a young and lonely man.

558
00:47:15,176 --> 00:47:16,680
我们演了一出很拙劣的戏码，是不是？
We put on a pretty poor show, didn't we?

559
00:47:21,323 --> 00:47:22,987
要是我能忘记就好了
If only I could forget.

560
00:47:29,786 --> 00:47:30,478
吉姆
Jim.

561
00:47:34,449 --> 00:47:36,342
谢天谢地，终于睡觉了
Thank heaven, sleeping at last.

562
00:47:39,033 --> 00:47:39,989
你的报告，医生
Your report, Doctor.

563
00:47:40,401 --> 00:47:44,467
哦，弗林特先生的三录仪读数终于相关了
Oh, those, uh, tricorder readings on Mr. Flint are finally correlated.

564
00:47:45,298 --> 00:47:45,936
他快死了
He's dying.

565
00:47:46,585 --> 00:47:50,014
你看，弗林特在带着塑造他的复杂场
You see, Flint, in leaving Earth, with all of its complex fields

566
00:47:50,014 --> 00:47:52,831
离开地球时，牺牲了不朽
within which he was formed, sacrificed immortality.

567
00:47:53,754 --> 00:47:56,649
他将过完正常的生活，然后死去
He'll live the rest of a normal life and die.

568
00:47:56,808 --> 00:47:58,430
那一天，我会哀悼
On that day, I shall mourn.

569
00:48:00,389 --> 00:48:01,149
他知道吗？
Does he know?

570
00:48:01,464 --> 00:48:05,296
是的，我告诉他了，他打算把余生
Yes, I told him myself. He intends to devote the remainder of his years

571
00:48:05,323 --> 00:48:08,737
和他的伟大能力奉献给人类健康的改善
and great abilities to the improvement of the human condition.

572
00:48:09,616 --> 00:48:11,338
谁知道他会想出什么？
And who knows what he might come up with.

573
00:48:11,740 --> 00:48:12,512
的确
Indeed.

574
00:48:14,412 --> 00:48:18,277
好吧，我想这就是全部，我可以稍后告诉吉姆，或者你来说
Well, I guess that's all. I can tell Jim later, or you can.

575
00:48:21,383 --> 00:48:26,247
考虑到对手的长寿，真是一个永恒的三角恋
Considering his opponent's longevity, truly an eternal triangle.

576
00:48:29,232 --> 00:48:30,769
你不会明白的，对吧史波克？
You wouldn't understand that, would you Spock?

577
00:48:32,266 --> 00:48:35,018
你看，我为你比为他感到更难过
You see, I feel sorrier for you than I do for him,

578
00:48:36,230 --> 00:48:39,558
因为你永远不会知道爱情能驱使一个人做什么
because you'll never know the things that love can drive a man to.

579
00:48:41,104 --> 00:48:43,201
