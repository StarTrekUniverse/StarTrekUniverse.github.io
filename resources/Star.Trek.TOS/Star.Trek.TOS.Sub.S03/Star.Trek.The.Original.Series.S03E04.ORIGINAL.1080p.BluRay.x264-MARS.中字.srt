他死了，舰长

35
00:04:42,595 --> 00:04:46,515
- 没有悲伤的迹象？  - 没有任何类型的迹象
- No sign of grief? - No indication of any kind.

36
00:04:46,682 --> 00:04:49,518
- 恐惧？  - 他们似乎完全不害怕
- Fear? - They seem completely unafraid.

37
00:04:49,685 --> 00:04:55,316
- 你坚持认为这是创伤性休克？  - 我不坚持，但这是可能的
- You insist it's traumatic shock? - I don't insist but it's possible.

38
00:04:55,483 --> 00:05:01,572
一个孩子压抑着父母双亡的事实？我不相信
A child suppresses the fact that both parents are dead? I can't believe it.

39
00:05:01,739 --> 00:05:05,409
人类确实有选择性相信的能力
Humans do have a capacity for believing what they choose

40
00:05:05,576 --> 00:05:07,870
不去想痛苦的东西
and excluding what is painful.

41
00:05:08,037 --> 00:05:12,583
- 不是这些孩子，这太不可思议了  - 他们看到了难以置信的东西
- Not these children. It's incredible. - What they saw is incredible.

42
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:18,172
看过那些死亡的惨状，任何反应都是可能的，包括记忆缺失
The way those deaths occurred, any reaction is possible, including amnesia.

43
00:05:18,339 --> 00:05:23,219
这是我的诊断，在进行具体测试之前，我保留意见
That's my diagnosis. Until specific tests can be made, it remains that.

44
00:05:23,386 --> 00:05:27,139
目前，我将以这一观点为指导
I'll be guided by that opinion, for the present.

45
00:05:28,349 --> 00:05:31,018
要不问问他们？
What about questioning them?

46
00:05:31,185 --> 00:05:33,562
创伤减弱前不要问
Not until traumatization weakens

47
00:05:33,729 --> 00:05:36,440
或者你想出另一种解释
or you come up with another explanation.

48
00:05:36,607 --> 00:05:41,112
强迫他们看这个经历可能会导致永久性损害
Forcing them to see this experience could cause permanent damage.

49
00:05:43,155 --> 00:05:45,116
同意，医生
Accepted, Doctor.

50
00:05:47,952 --> 00:05:49,453
小心
Be careful.

51
00:05:53,374 --> 00:05:56,085
我...对不起，柯克舰长
I'm... I'm sorry, Captain Kirk.

52
00:06:05,803 --> 00:06:10,933
孩子？听我说，很晚了，是时候上船了
Children? Listen to me. It's late and it's time to go up to the ship.

53
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:13,102
哦，还没有
Oh, not yet.

54
00:06:13,269 --> 00:06:18,774
- 我们才刚刚开始玩得开心  - 现在不行
- We're just beginning to have fun. - Not now.

55
00:06:18,941 --> 00:06:22,486
抱歉，你们得和医生一起上去
I'm sorry. You'll go up with the doctor.

56
00:06:29,076 --> 00:06:31,579
来吧，是时候出发了
Come on. It's time to be going.

57
00:06:34,331 --> 00:06:39,003
这里发生的事情只有那些孩子们知道
Whatever happened here is locked up inside those children.

58
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:43,924
对斯塔恩斯小队的攻击肯定是无端的
The attack on Starnes' party must surely have been unprovoked.

59
00:06:44,091 --> 00:06:48,304
攻击？看起来似乎是大规模自杀
Attack? Mass suicide is what it seems to be.

60
00:06:48,471 --> 00:06:52,767
我认错，诱发将是一个更精确的术语
I stand corrected. Induced would be a more precise term.

61
00:06:52,933 --> 00:06:56,145
由外力诱发
Induced by an outside force.

62
00:06:56,979 --> 00:06:59,690
- 比如？  - 细菌的释放
- Such as? - The release of bacteria.

63
00:06:59,857 --> 00:07:04,320
或是无助的精神抑郁和有自杀倾向的焦虑的状态
Or a helpless mental depression and a state of suicidal anxiety

64
00:07:04,487 --> 00:07:06,947
可能是由化学诱导的
could have been chemically induced.

65
00:07:07,114 --> 00:07:08,991
是什么能让孩子们免疫？
What would make the children immune?

66
00:07:09,158 --> 00:07:13,537
我不知道，但这是可能的
I do not know. But it is possible.

67
00:07:13,746 --> 00:07:18,667
孩子们可以通过有意识的设计来豁免
The children would have been exempted by conscious design.

68
00:07:18,834 --> 00:07:23,047
- 我会说，这是一个合逻辑的假设  - 他们现在的行为可以用
- A valid assumption, I would say. - And their present behavior

69
00:07:23,214 --> 00:07:26,300
对惩罚的恐惧来解释。
explained by a fear of punishment.

70
00:07:26,467 --> 00:07:30,137
或是对奖励的承诺
Or the promise of reward.

71
00:07:30,304 --> 00:07:33,557
一个未知的袭击者攻击
An attack by an unknown assailant

72
00:07:33,766 --> 00:07:36,727
一个无人居住的星球
on an uninhabited planet.

73
00:07:36,894 --> 00:07:41,232
就我们所知，这个星球是无人居住的？
This planet is uninhabited, to the best of our information?

74
00:07:41,398 --> 00:07:43,567
目前，是的
At present, yes.

75
00:07:48,697 --> 00:07:51,575
- 奇怪  - 有读数？
- Odd. - Getting a reading?

76
00:07:54,787 --> 00:08:00,084
似乎有一些干扰来自那个洞穴
There seems to be some disturbance coming from that cave.

77
00:08:14,431 --> 00:08:16,934
有任何生命形式吗？
Picking up any life-forms?

78
00:08:17,101 --> 00:08:19,770
绝对不是人形生物，舰长
Definitely not humanoid, Captain.

79
00:08:19,937 --> 00:08:23,899
无法确认具体身份
Impossible to make any specific identification.

80
00:08:24,066 --> 00:08:27,862
读数与任何已知信息无关
Readings do not correlate with any known information.

81
00:08:28,028 --> 00:08:30,114
奇怪
That's strange.

82
00:08:31,407 --> 00:08:35,077
那...非常奇怪
That's... very strange.

83
00:08:35,244 --> 00:08:39,081
我在这个地方有一种焦虑的感觉
I'm getting a feeling of anxiety in this place.

84
00:08:40,291 --> 00:08:44,295
听起来很不科学，不是吗？
It doesn't sound very scientific, does it?

85
00:08:44,461 --> 00:08:47,798
但在这里是最强的
But it's strongest right here.

86
00:08:47,965 --> 00:08:50,551
我不知道
I'm not aware of it.

87
00:08:50,718 --> 00:08:54,471
也许这就是你三录仪上显示的东西。
Maybe that's what's registering on your tricorder.

88
00:08:54,638 --> 00:08:59,310
我不知道焦虑能在传感器上显示
I was not aware that anxiety could be registered on sensors.

89
00:08:59,476 --> 00:09:00,561
不能...
No...

90
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:06,775
当然不能，那...是我
Of course. That's... that's me.

91
00:09:08,444 --> 00:09:10,279
那是我
That's me.

92
00:09:10,446 --> 00:09:15,492
但是，是什么导致的的三录仪做出反应呢？
But what's causing your tricorder to react?

93
00:09:24,168 --> 00:09:29,506
- 你没事吧，舰长？  - 是的，我很好，我...很好
- Are you all right, Captain? - Yes, I'm fine. I'm... fine.

94
00:09:32,259 --> 00:09:37,014
只是对这里发生的事情产生了一些共鸣
Just some sympathetic vibration with what happened here.

95
00:09:37,181 --> 00:09:39,767
让我们回船上
Let's get back to the ship.

96
00:09:39,934 --> 00:09:44,647
我想检查一下斯塔恩斯教授的三录仪的磁带
I want to check out those tapes from Professor Starnes' tricorder.

97
00:09:47,191 --> 00:09:49,777
我要问问那些孩子
And I am going to question those children.

98
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:58,285
好的，每张卡代表不同的口味
All right. Each card is a different flavor.

99
00:09:58,452 --> 00:10:01,038
随你挑，电脑会混合组合
Take your pick and the computer will mix a combination.

100
00:10:01,205 --> 00:10:03,624
说出你最喜欢的
Call out your favorite.

101
00:10:03,791 --> 00:10:06,168
- 香草！- 巧克力！
- Vanilla! - Chocolate!

102
00:10:06,335 --> 00:10:07,795
好的！
OK!

103
00:10:13,801 --> 00:10:16,553
你想要一个惊喜吗，史蒂夫？
Well. Would you like a surprise, Stevie?

104
00:10:27,481 --> 00:10:30,859
这是椰子和香草，它们都是白的
It's coconut and vanilla. They're both white.

105
00:10:31,026 --> 00:10:32,820
那里，那里，现在
There, there, now.

106
00:10:32,987 --> 00:10:36,323
既有令人不快的惊喜，也有令人愉快的惊喜
There are unpleasant surprises as well as pleasant ones.

107
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:42,329
那是你不喜欢的，你想来个你喜欢的吗？
That was your unpleasant one. What would you like for your pleasant one?

108
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:46,000
巧克力旋和开心果
Chocolate wobble and pistachio.

109
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:48,502
好吧，马上就来了
Well, coming right up.

110
00:10:48,669 --> 00:10:50,546
还有桃子
And peach.

111
00:10:54,383 --> 00:10:57,678
好吧，这将是一个美妙的惊喜
All right. It's going to be a wonderful surprise.

112
00:11:05,978 --> 00:11:08,022
测试显示没有撒谎的迹象
Tests show no evidence of lying.

113
00:11:08,188 --> 00:11:10,524
他们表现得好像没什么问题
They behave as though nothing's wrong.

114
00:11:10,691 --> 00:11:12,735
他们的身体很健康
They're sound physically,

115
00:11:12,901 --> 00:11:16,613
并且没有药物迹象来解释它们目前的状态
and no signs of substances to account for their present state.

116
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:19,450
- 我没有答案  - 一定有
- I have no answers. - There has to be one.

117
00:11:19,616 --> 00:11:22,286
难道不能等到我们去医院吗？
Can't it wait till we get to a hospital?

118
00:11:22,453 --> 00:11:27,291
我们不会离开，除非我们知道发生了什么，或者正在发生什么
We're not leaving until we know what went on, or what's going on.

119
00:11:27,458 --> 00:11:31,628
我不会阻止你质问他们，但这可能会伤害孩子们
I won't prevent you questioning them, but it could harm the children.

120
00:11:31,795 --> 00:11:35,966
如果我不这样做，对他们来说可能会更糟，对我们也是如此
It could be worse for them if I don't, and for us too.

121
00:11:36,133 --> 00:11:38,010
小心
Be careful.

122
00:11:41,013 --> 00:11:44,308
结束之后，我们可以一起玩游戏。
After this, we can all play games.

123
00:11:46,977 --> 00:11:50,564
从电脑里拿出冰淇淋是什么感觉？
What's it like getting your ice cream out of a computer?

124
00:11:50,731 --> 00:11:55,152
- 这很有趣  - 嗯，你们都玩得很开心
- That was fun. - Well, you're all having a good time.

125
00:11:55,319 --> 00:11:58,155
- 我想我要加入你们，可以吗？  - 请便
- I think I'll join you. Is that OK? - Please do.

126
00:11:58,322 --> 00:11:59,740
好吧，我也要一份冰淇淋
All right. I'll have a dish too.

127
00:11:59,907 --> 00:12:04,828
一份非常小的，它比提拉库斯更好，不是吗？
A very small one. It's better than Triacus, isn't it?

128
00:12:04,995 --> 00:12:09,333
- 那个肮脏的老星球？  - 那地方有什么好的？
- That dirty old planet? - What's so good about that place?

129
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:12,628
你在那里的时间不长，你不知道
You weren't there very long. You don't know.

130
00:12:12,795 --> 00:12:17,424
- 我认为你们的父母不喜欢它  - 不，他们喜欢
- I don't think your parents liked it. - Yes, they did.

131
00:12:17,591 --> 00:12:21,303
- 我的父母也喜欢  - 父母喜欢愚蠢的事情
- Mine sure did. - Parents like stupid things.

132
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:24,473
我不确定，父母喜欢孩子
I don't know. Parents like children.

133
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:27,184
哈，那是你的想法
Ha. That's what you think.

134
00:12:28,852 --> 00:12:33,023
我确定你们的父母爱你们，所以他们带你们去提拉库斯
I'm sure your parents loved you. That's why they took you to Triacus.

135
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:36,693
这样他们就不会和你们分别很久
So they wouldn't be far away from you for a long time.

136
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:39,863
那会让他们不高兴，他们会想念你们的
That would make them unhappy. They'd miss you.

137
00:12:40,072 --> 00:12:43,450
我相信你们也会想念他们的
I'm sure that you would miss them too.

138
00:12:50,999 --> 00:12:53,335
忙，忙...
Busy, busy...

139
00:12:53,502 --> 00:12:56,797
忙，忙，忙，忙！
Busy, busy, busy, busy!

140
00:12:56,964 --> 00:13:01,218
孩子：忙，忙，忙，忙！
CHILDREN: Busy, busy, busy, busy!

141
00:13:10,102 --> 00:13:13,230
- 猜猜我们是什么？  - 我知道，一群蜜蜂
- Guess what we are? - I know. A swarm of bees.

142
00:13:18,026 --> 00:13:21,238
小心，小心，我会刺你
Watch out. Watch out. I'll sting you.

143
00:13:24,616 --> 00:13:25,659
现在，等一下
Now, wait a minute.

144
00:13:25,826 --> 00:13:28,871
我们能吃更多的冰淇淋吗？
Can we have more ice cream, please?

145
00:13:29,037 --> 00:13:31,507
不能，它会毁了你的晚餐
I don't think so. It'll spoil your dinner.

146
00:13:31,674 --> 00:13:33,834
看见没？他们都这么说
See? They all say it.

147
00:13:34,001 --> 00:13:36,086
是的
Yeah.

148
00:13:38,088 --> 00:13:42,593
你们度过了忙碌的一天，查佩尔护士会送你们回宿舍
You've had a busy day. Nurse Chapel will see you to your quarters.

149
00:13:42,759 --> 00:13:45,345
非常好的主意，来吧
Very good idea. Come on.

150
00:13:45,512 --> 00:13:49,183
- 我们必须这样做吗？  - 汤米，等一会儿
- Do we have to? - Tommy, just a moment.

151
00:13:49,349 --> 00:13:53,145
我想问你一个问题，来坐下
I'd like to ask you a question. Come and sit down.

152
00:14:00,694 --> 00:14:03,405
你能告诉我你看到了什么吗？
Will you tell me what you saw?

153
00:14:03,572 --> 00:14:06,074
在哪里看到？
Saw where?

154
00:14:06,241 --> 00:14:10,037
在山洞里，在星球上，在提拉库斯
In the cave. On the planet. On Triacus.

155
00:14:10,204 --> 00:14:13,248
- 你在那里  - 你今天看到你父亲了吗？
- You were there. - Did you see your father today?

156
00:14:13,415 --> 00:14:16,126
- 我看到了他  - 他看起来很生气吗？
- I saw him. - Did he seem upset?

157
00:14:16,293 --> 00:14:18,921
- 他很生气  - 为什么生气？
- He was very upset. - What about?

158
00:14:19,087 --> 00:14:23,467
- 我没有问他  - 发生了什么事惹他生气了？
- I didn't ask him. - What was going on to upset him?

159
00:14:23,634 --> 00:14:28,639
我怎么知道？他总是很生气，就像你一样
How should I know? He was always upset, just like you.

160
00:14:30,265 --> 00:14:33,977
我没有生你或你的朋友的气
I'm not upset with you, or your friends.

161
00:14:35,938 --> 00:14:40,984
我们邀请你登上了企业号，如果我不喜欢你，我为什么要这样做？
We invited you aboard the <i>Enterprise</i>. Why would I do that if I didn't like you?

162
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:43,737
你有你的理由
You have your reasons.

163
00:14:43,904 --> 00:14:46,990
你没有对离开提拉库斯感到不高兴吗？
Aren't you unhappy about leaving Triacus?

164
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:50,077
那个地方？那里是给成年人的
That place? That's for adults.

165
00:14:50,244 --> 00:14:54,915
你不为离开你的父母而难过吗？
Aren't you upset about leaving your parents?

166
00:14:55,082 --> 00:14:58,001
我的父母？他们喜欢那里
My parents? They love it down there.

167
00:14:58,210 --> 00:15:00,587
总是很忙
Always busy.

168
00:15:03,257 --> 00:15:05,175
他们很高兴
They're happy.

169
00:15:05,342 --> 00:15:08,262
我现在可以走了吗？我也累了，你知道的
Can I go now? I'm tired too, you know.

170
00:15:08,428 --> 00:15:12,307
- 是的，当然，我带你去  - 我认识路
- Yes, certainly. I'll take you. - I know the way.

171
00:15:24,027 --> 00:15:28,865
柯克呼叫安保部门，派人看着孩子们
Kirk to security. Post a guard on the children.

172
00:15:29,032 --> 00:15:32,035
他们要一直处于监视之下
They're to be kept under constant watch.

173
00:15:32,202 --> 00:15:35,789
所有人：<i>冰雹，冰雹，火和雪</i>
ALL: <i>Hail, hail, fire and snow,</i>

174
00:15:35,956 --> 00:15:39,209
<i>呼叫天使，我们要走了</i>
<i>call the angel, we will go,</i>

175
00:15:39,376 --> 00:15:43,046
<i>远远地，看到了</i>
<i>far away, for to see,</i>

176
00:15:43,213 --> 00:15:46,550
<i>友好的天使来找我</i>
<i>friendly angel come to me.</i>

177
00:15:46,758 --> 00:15:50,137
<i>冰雹，冰雹，火和雪</i>
<i>Hail, hail, fire and snow,</i>

178
00:15:50,304 --> 00:15:53,557
<i>呼叫天使，我们要走了</i>
<i>call the angel, we will go,</i>

179
00:15:53,724 --> 00:15:56,476
<i>远远地，看到了</i>
<i>far away, for to see,</i>

180
00:15:56,643 --> 00:16:00,272
<i>友好的天使来找我</i>
<i>friendly angel come to me.</i>...

181
00:16:06,361 --> 00:16:09,239
朋友们，你们做得很好
You have done very well, my friends.

182
00:16:09,406 --> 00:16:12,743
你们已经做了必须做的事情
You have done what must be done.

183
00:16:12,909 --> 00:16:15,829
你们已经登上了<i>企业号</i>
You have come aboard the <i>Enterprise.</i>

184
00:16:15,996 --> 00:16:20,667
现在，我们的目的地是联邦殖民地
Now, our destination is a Federation settlement.

185
00:16:20,834 --> 00:16:25,922
柯克舰长无疑会选择离得更近的太空站
Captain Kirk will undoubtedly choose a closer station.

186
00:16:26,089 --> 00:16:31,762
不要让这阻止你们，马科斯十二号星球有数百万人在上面
Do not let that deter you. Marcos XII has millions of people on it.

187
00:16:31,928 --> 00:16:35,057
近百万人将加入我们，成为我们的朋友
Nearly a million will join us as our friends.

188
00:16:35,223 --> 00:16:38,101
其余的将是我们的敌人
The rest will be our enemies.

189
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:43,774
与其他愿意加入我们的朋友一起，我们将击败我们的敌人
Together with our other friends who will join us, we will defeat our enemies

190
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:46,443
因为我们在提拉库斯上击败了他们
as we defeated them on Triacus.

191
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:51,281
马科斯上的一百万朋友将使我们立于不败之地
A million friends on Marcos will make us invincible.

192
00:16:51,448 --> 00:16:56,578
将没人命令我们去哪里，什么时候睡觉，在哪里吃饭
No one will tell us where to go, when to sleep, where to eat.

193
00:16:56,745 --> 00:17:01,875
宇宙将由我来控制，由你们来玩耍
The universe will be mine to command, yours to play in.

194
00:17:02,042 --> 00:17:06,755
为了完成这个伟大的使命，我们必须首先控制<i>企业号</i>
To accomplish this great mission, we must first control the <i>Enterprise</i>.

195
00:17:06,922 --> 00:17:11,385
要控制这艘船，我们首先必须控制船员
To control the ship, we first must control the crew.

196
00:17:11,551 --> 00:17:15,597
你知道怎么做，这是你们的下一个任务
You know how to do that. That is your next task.

197
00:17:15,764 --> 00:17:21,395
你们信什么，你们就做什么，你们就做什么
And as you believe, so shall you do, so shall you do.

198
00:17:21,561 --> 00:17:26,400
你们信什么，你们就做什么，你们就做什么
As you believe, so shall you do, so shall you do.

199
00:17:26,566 --> 00:17:31,238
你们信什么，你们就做什么，你们就做什么
As you believe, so shall you do, so shall you do.

200
00:17:43,792 --> 00:17:45,961
维持标准轨道
Maintaining standard orbit.

201
00:17:46,336 --> 00:17:49,131
有行星安全小队的报告吗？
Any report from planet's security team?

202
00:17:49,297 --> 00:17:52,634
一切都很安静，长官
Everything is quiet, sir.

203
00:17:52,801 --> 00:17:57,514
我提取了斯塔恩斯教授的磁带中主要的部分
I have extracted the salient portion of Professor Starnes' tapes.

204
00:18:02,018 --> 00:18:03,520
在收集到的技术事实中
Among the technical facts gathered,

205
00:18:03,687 --> 00:18:07,357
他还提出了不科学的假设
he also offered unscientific hypotheses.

206
00:18:07,524 --> 00:18:09,443
让我们看看
Let's see them.

207
00:18:11,027 --> 00:18:13,864
斯塔恩斯：<i>日志日期 5025.3</i>
STARNES: <i>Log date 5025.3.</i>

208
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:15,824
<i>自从我们抵达提拉库斯以来</i>
<i>Ever since our arrival on Triacus,</i>

209
00:18:15,991 --> 00:18:20,203
<i>我感到日益不安</i>
<i>I've felt a growing feeling of uneasiness.</i>

210
00:18:20,412 --> 00:18:26,918
<i>首先，我将其归因于与新项目相关的常见的神经问题</i>
<i>First, I attributed it to the usual case of nerves associated with a new project.</i>

211
00:18:28,044 --> 00:18:34,176
<i>然而，我发现我的其他同事也受到焦虑的困扰</i>
<i>However, I found the rest of my associates also bothered by anxieties.</i>

212
00:18:34,342 --> 00:18:37,304
<i>唯一没有受到影响的是孩子们</i>
<i>The only ones not affected are the children.</i>

213
00:18:37,471 --> 00:18:40,557
<i>他们发现整件事是一次令人兴奋的冒险</i>
<i>They find the whole thing an exciting adventure.</i>

214
00:18:40,724 --> 00:18:42,684
<i>啊，再次年轻</i>
<i>Ah, to be young again.</i>

215
00:18:42,851 --> 00:18:48,982
让我们再看看这些不科学的假设，史波克先生
Let's see some more of these unscientific hypotheses, Mr. Spock.

216
00:18:53,445 --> 00:18:55,906
<i>5032.4.</i>
<i>5032.4.</i>

217
00:18:56,072 --> 00:19:01,745
<i>我们都有的这种焦虑感越来越严重</i>
<i>The feeling of anxiety we've all been experiencing is growing worse.</i>

218
00:19:01,953 --> 00:19:07,459
还有另一部分，我想你会认为特别有趣
There is another portion which I think you'll find particularly interesting.

219
00:19:10,754 --> 00:19:12,839
<i>5038.3.</i>
<i>5038.3.</i>

220
00:19:13,006 --> 00:19:16,593
<i>威尔金斯教授今天完成了他的挖掘工作</i>
<i>Professor Wilkins finished his excavation today.</i>

221
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:22,766
<i>虽然这里的文明被一场自然灾害摧毁了</i>
<i>Although the civilization here was destroyed by a natural catastrophe,</i>

222
00:19:22,974 --> 00:19:26,353
<i>看来我们的一个种族在山洞里避难了</i>
<i>it would appear one of our race took refuge in the cave.</i>

223
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:33,109
<i>对于我们的努力，我们只是变得更加担心</i>
<i>For our efforts, we are becoming only more apprehensive.</i>

224
00:19:33,276 --> 00:19:38,031
<i>仿佛某种看不见的力量正在影响着我们......</i>
<i>As if some unseen force were influencing us...</i>

225
00:19:39,783 --> 00:19:42,410
- 发生了什么事？  - 未知
- What happened? - Unknown.

226
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:49,292
我没有看到你进来
I didn't see you come in.

227
00:19:49,501 --> 00:19:53,547
我们离开这里后，你能带我们去马科斯十二号星球吗？
After we leave here, can you take us to Marcos XII?

228
00:19:53,713 --> 00:19:56,716
我们可能会带你们去一个联邦星际基地
We'll probably take you to a Federation starbase.

229
00:19:56,883 --> 00:20:00,554
- 我在马科斯十二号上有亲戚  - 对不起
- I have relatives on Marcos XII. - I'm sorry.

230
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:05,976
它不在我们的巡逻区域内，史波克先生，我们将在我的宿舍里讨论这个问题
It's not in our patrol area. Mr. Spock, we'll pursue this in my quarters.

231
00:20:06,142 --> 00:20:09,312
我可以留在这里观看吗？我会非常安静
Can I stay here and watch? I'll be very quiet.

232
00:20:11,314 --> 00:20:16,236
好的，汤米，上尉，让麦考伊医生到我的宿舍报告
All right, Tommy. Lieutenant, have Dr. McCoy report to my quarters.

233
00:20:16,403 --> 00:20:18,488
莱斯利先生？
Mr. Leslie?

234
00:20:42,679 --> 00:20:45,140
- 嗨，你好  - 嗨
- Hi, there. - Hi.

235
00:21:32,354 --> 00:21:34,564
那是什么？
What is that?

236
00:21:37,525 --> 00:21:40,236
行星提拉库斯
The planet Triacus.

237
00:21:40,403 --> 00:21:44,199
- 我们在这里的时候会一直看到它吗？  - 是的，我们会的
- Will we see it all the time we're here? - Yes, we will.

238
00:21:44,366 --> 00:21:49,037
- 我们在这里的时间里都能看到  - 他在屏幕上看到了提拉库斯
- All the time we're here. - He sees Triacus on the screen.

239
00:21:49,204 --> 00:21:51,664
他以为他看到了
He thinks he sees it.

240
00:22:03,635 --> 00:22:06,638
苏鲁先生，屏幕，我们脱离轨道了
Mr. Sulu, the screen. We're out of orbit.

241
00:22:24,364 --> 00:22:28,410
- 我们很快就会到达马科斯十二号吗？  - 很快
- Will we reach Marcos XII soon? - Very soon.

242
00:23:05,488 --> 00:23:08,450
我们什么时候改变航线的？
When did we change course?

243
00:23:08,616 --> 00:23:12,412
- 我们没有改变航线  - 你是什么意思？
- We haven't changed course. - What do you mean?

244
00:23:12,579 --> 00:23:16,124
- 看看你的控制显示器  - 我们仍然在轨道上
- Look at your control monitor. - We're still in orbit.

245
00:23:16,291 --> 00:23:20,086
你瞎了吗？那不是轨道位置
Have you gone blind? That's not orbiting position.

246
00:23:20,253 --> 00:23:24,174
- 别碰控制器  - 你到底在干什么？
- Don't touch the controls. - What the devil are you doing?

247
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:28,428
- 我们必须留在这个轨道上  - 你这个瞎子
- We must remain in this orbit. - You blind fool.

248
00:23:28,595 --> 00:23:32,849
你看不见你面前的东西吗？我们不在轨道上
Can't you see what's in front of you? We're not in orbit.

249
00:23:33,808 --> 00:23:35,477
我不会违抗舰桥的命令
I won't disobey orders from the bridge.

250
00:23:35,643 --> 00:23:38,980
你正在违抗命令，现在退到一边
You are. Now step aside.

251
00:23:40,523 --> 00:23:43,276
你正在失去对自己的控制，长官
You're losing control of yourself, sir.

252
00:23:43,443 --> 00:23:45,653
还没有
Not yet.

253
00:24:03,171 --> 00:24:06,799
斯塔恩斯：<i>我受到影响，去做一些没有意义的事情</i>
STARNES: <i>I'm being influenced to do things that do not make sense.</i>

254
00:24:06,966 --> 00:24:10,386
<i>我甚至联系星际舰队司令部</i>
<i>I even went so far as to call Starfleet Command</i>

255
00:24:10,553 --> 00:24:14,849
<i>请求将宇宙飞船用作运输工具</i>
<i>to request a spaceship to be used as a transport.</i>

256
00:24:15,016 --> 00:24:17,977
<i>直到我不知道该运输什么时</i>
<i>It was only when I didn't know what to transport </i>

257
00:24:18,144 --> 00:24:21,731
<i>我才意识到我的思想正在被引导</i>
<i>that I realized my mind was being directed.</i>

258
00:24:21,898 --> 00:24:25,902
<i>我决定向星际舰队发出警告</i>
<i>I decided to send a dispatch to Starfleet, warning them.</i>

259
00:24:27,403 --> 00:24:30,907
<i>上帝宽恕我们，我们必须毁灭自己</i>
<i>God forgive us. We must destroy ourselves.</i>

260
00:24:31,074 --> 00:24:35,370
<i>外星人降临，敌人来自内部</i>
<i>Alien upon us. The enemy from within.</i>

261
00:24:35,537 --> 00:24:37,789
<i>敌人？！</i>
<i>The enemy?!</i>

262
00:24:41,876 --> 00:24:45,255
他没有完成记录，也没有发送急件
He never completed the entry. The dispatch wasn't sent.

263
00:24:45,421 --> 00:24:49,342
除了家庭生活的场景，与孩子们的游戏
Except for scenes of family life, games with the children,

264
00:24:49,509 --> 00:24:52,011
那被完整地记录了
that is the complete record.

265
00:24:52,178 --> 00:24:55,765
无论什么压倒了他们，他们一定做得如此之快
Whatever overwhelmed them must have done so fast.

266
00:24:55,932 --> 00:25:00,353
否则，教授会提供经历的细节
Otherwise the professor would have provided details of the experience.

267
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:05,024
他是一位出色的科学家，孜孜不倦地追求真理
He was an excellent scientist and tireless in his pursuit of the truth.

268
00:25:05,191 --> 00:25:10,029
- 这可能就是摧毁他的原因  - 邪恶确实试图维持权力
- That could be what destroyed him. - Evil does seek to maintain power

269
00:25:10,196 --> 00:25:14,367
- 通过压制真相  - 或误导无辜者
- by suppressing the truth. - Or misleading the innocent.

270
00:25:14,534 --> 00:25:18,121
误导无辜者？我想知道
Misleading the innocent? I wonder.

271
00:25:18,288 --> 00:25:22,875
你的意思是孩子们可能参与其中吗？
Do you mean the children may be involved?

272
00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:34,596
是的，医生，我们对住在这里的种族了解多少？
Yes, Doctor. What do we know about the race that lived here?

273
00:25:34,762 --> 00:25:38,641
根据传说，提拉库斯是一群掠夺者的所在地
According to legend, Triacus was the seat of a band of marauders

274
00:25:38,808 --> 00:25:42,145
他们在整个爱普西隆印地星系中不断进行战争
who were at constant war throughout Epsilon Indi.

275
00:25:42,353 --> 00:25:48,318
几个世纪后，驱逐舰被他们掠夺的人摧毁
After centuries, the destroyers were destroyed by those they preyed upon.

276
00:25:48,484 --> 00:25:52,238
- 这就是结局吗？  - 不，像许多传说一样
- Is that the end of it? - No. Like so many legends,

277
00:25:52,405 --> 00:25:55,074
这个传说有个可怕的结局
this one has a frightening ending.

278
00:25:55,241 --> 00:26:00,330
它警告说，邪恶正在等待催化剂再次启动它
It warns that the evil is awaiting a catalyst to set it again into motion

279
00:26:00,496 --> 00:26:03,499
并让它穿越银河系
and send it marauding across the galaxy.

280
00:26:05,918 --> 00:26:11,174
邪恶有可能找到催化剂吗？
Is it possible that the evil found the catalyst?

281
00:26:11,382 --> 00:26:17,013
- 我说的是一个传说  - 大多数传说都有其事实依据
- I was speaking of a legend. - Most legends have their basis in fact.

282
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:21,017
我明白你的意思，但作为医务人员，我必须警告你
I read you, but as medical officer, I must warn you.

283
00:26:21,184 --> 00:26:26,522
除非孩子们释放和宣泄正常的悲伤
Unless the normal grief is tapped and released from these children,

284
00:26:26,689 --> 00:26:28,816
否则你是在踩红线
you are treading dangerously.

285
00:26:28,983 --> 00:26:32,028
我理解你的诊断，我会尊重它
I understand your diagnosis and I'll respect it.

286
00:26:32,195 --> 00:26:36,783
但不会把ii<i>企业号</i>的安全置之度外，谢谢
But not to the exclusion of the safety of the <i>Enterprise</i>. Thank you.

287
00:26:42,372 --> 00:26:45,541
还有哪些探险队访问过提拉库斯？
What other expeditions have visited Triacus?

288
00:26:45,708 --> 00:26:49,545
根据联邦的记录，这是第一次
According to Federation records, this is the first.

289
00:26:49,712 --> 00:26:52,882
斯塔恩斯对看不见的力量有什么看法？
What did Starnes say about the unseen force?

290
00:26:53,049 --> 00:26:56,552
他说，一股看不见的力量正在影响着他
He said an unseen force was influencing him.

291
00:26:56,719 --> 00:27:01,849
他意识到了这一点，与它作斗争，并取消了他要一艘船的请求
He recognized it, was fighting it, and canceled his request for a ship.

292
00:27:03,184 --> 00:27:08,940
一艘船？是的，一艘通往提拉库斯的船，但是为什么？由谁？
A ship? Yes. A ship for Triacus. But why? And by whom?

293
00:27:10,942 --> 00:27:15,530
警卫部队，准备执行救援任务，在传送室集合
Security detachment. Ready for relief duty. Assemble in transporter room.

294
00:27:15,697 --> 00:27:19,701
他们传送上来的时候，我有一些问题要问他们
I'll have questions for that detachment when they're beamed up.

295
00:27:19,867 --> 00:27:24,831
现在是时候让我们弄清楚斯塔恩斯的敌人
It's about time we found out whether Starnes' enemy within

296
00:27:24,997 --> 00:27:28,501
是在下面的星球上还是和我们一起在船上了
is on the planet below or here on board with us.

297
00:27:28,668 --> 00:27:30,378
来吧
Come on.

298
00:27:43,850 --> 00:27:48,604
你们的任务将持续一个小时，准备好你们的通讯器
Your tour of duty will last one hour. Be prepared with your communicators

299
00:27:48,771 --> 00:27:52,233
报告任何外星生物，不要等待调查
to report any alien beings. Don't wait to investigate.

300
00:28:01,993 --> 00:28:04,996
【把警卫部队从提拉库斯传送上来
Beam up the security detachment from Triacus.

301
00:28:12,003 --> 00:28:13,796
史波克？
Spock?

302
00:28:17,258 --> 00:28:19,302
怎么了？
What's wrong?

303
00:28:21,387 --> 00:28:24,932
- 我无法锁定坐标  - 为什么不呢？
- I can't lock on to the coordinates. - Why not?

304
00:28:25,099 --> 00:28:28,978
看来我们不再绕着提拉库斯运行
It appears we are no longer orbiting Triacus.

305
00:28:29,145 --> 00:28:31,272
那不可能
That's impossible.

306
00:28:31,439 --> 00:28:37,153
如果我们不绕着提拉库斯运行，那么我传送下去的人就死了
If we're not orbiting Triacus, the men I beamed down are dead.

307
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:40,990
舰长，我们不再绕着提拉库斯运行
Captain, we are no longer orbiting Triacus.

308
00:28:41,157 --> 00:28:43,659
激活舰桥监视器屏幕
Activate the bridge monitor screen.

309
00:28:53,127 --> 00:28:57,340
舰长呼叫舰桥，我们没有绕提拉库斯运行
Captain to bridge. We're not orbiting Triacus.

310
00:28:57,507 --> 00:29:02,094
从各方面来看，你都错了，我的屏幕上有提拉库斯
With all respects, you're wrong. I have Triacus on my screen now.

311
00:29:02,261 --> 00:29:04,514
你偏离了轨道，我上来了
You're off course. I'm coming up.

312
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:07,975
所有人：<i>冰雹，冰雹，火和雪</i>
ALL: <i>Hail, hail, fire and snow,</i>

313
00:29:08,142 --> 00:29:11,687
<i>呼叫天使，我们要走了</i>

314
00:29:11,854 --> 00:29:15,149
<i>远远地，看到了</i>

315
00:29:15,316 --> 00:29:18,528
<i>友好的天使来找我</i>

316
00:29:18,694 --> 00:29:20,863

Sulu...

317

<i>far away, for to see,</i>

319
00:29:27,870 --> 00:29:30,957
<i>友好的天使来找我</i>

320
00:29:52,728 --> 00:29:56,566
朋友们，我们已经到了危机时刻
Friends, we have reached a moment of crisis.

321
00:29:56,732 --> 00:30:00,987
敌人发现了我们的行动
The enemy have discovered our operation.

322
00:30:01,153 --> 00:30:06,242
但他们太晚了，他们不再控制这艘船了，是我们在控制
But they are too late. They no longer control the ship. We do.

323
00:30:06,409 --> 00:30:11,372
我们将取得胜利，他们会带我们去任何我们想要的地方
We shall prevail. They will take us any place we desire.

324
00:30:11,539 --> 00:30:16,210
回到你们的岗位，保持你们的控制
So back to your stations. Maintain your controls.

325
00:30:16,377 --> 00:30:22,425
如果抵抗力增加，召唤他们的野兽，他们的野兽会很好地为我们服务
If resistance mounts, call upon their beast. Their beast will serve us well.

326
00:30:22,633 --> 00:30:27,096
他们每个人心中的恐惧都是会吞噬他的野兽
The fear in each one of them is the beast which will consume him.

327
00:30:27,263 --> 00:30:29,932
还记得在提拉库斯上的情况吗？
Remember how it was on Triacus?

328
00:30:30,099 --> 00:30:34,061
如果他们抵抗，在<i>企业号</i>上也应该如此
If they resist, so shall it be on the <i>Enterprise</i>.

329
00:30:34,228 --> 00:30:38,024
如果你们需要我，呼叫我，我会出现
If you need me, call and I will appear.

330
00:30:38,190 --> 00:30:41,277
我们的新目标是马科斯十二号星球
Our new goal is Marcos XII.

331
00:30:41,444 --> 00:30:45,281
这是我们新的开始，我们决不能动摇
It is our new beginning. We must not falter.

332
00:30:53,706 --> 00:30:57,209
去你们的岗位，玛丽，你和我在一起
Go to your stations. Mary, you remain with me.

333
00:31:11,807 --> 00:31:17,647
舵手，忽略你在屏幕上看到的东西，你认为你看到的东西
Helmsman, disregard what you see on the screen, what you think you see.

334
00:31:17,813 --> 00:31:21,651
设定去星际基地4的航线
Set a course for Starbase 4.

335
00:31:27,114 --> 00:31:29,992
- 你听到我说话了吗？  - 是的，长官

336
00:31:32,703 --> 00:31:34,497
乌乎拉上尉

337
00:31:34,705 --> 00:31:39,460
联系星际基地4，告诉他们我们把孩子带到那里
Contact Starbase 4. Tell them we're bringing the children there.

338
00:31:39,627 --> 00:31:43,839
告诉星际舰队司令部我怀疑他们实际上是外星人
Tell Starfleet Command I suspect them of being alien in nature

339
00:31:44,006 --> 00:31:48,177
我希望在我们抵达时进行彻底的调查
and I want a thorough investigation made upon our arrival.

340
00:31:48,344 --> 00:31:50,346
是的，长官
Aye, aye, sir.

341
00:32:05,444 --> 00:32:07,196
上尉？
Lieutenant?

342
00:32:08,781 --> 00:32:12,827
- 你在看什么？  - 我看了到我的死亡
- What are you staring at? - I see my death.

343
00:32:15,287 --> 00:32:20,501
漫长的死亡，疾病和疼痛
A long death. Disease and pain.

344
00:32:20,668 --> 00:32:23,379
我看到了我的死亡
I see my death.

345
00:32:23,546 --> 00:32:26,382
- 那里什么都没有  - 哦，上帝！
- There's nothing there. - Oh, God!

346
00:32:26,549 --> 00:32:30,886
舰长，不要让它成为现实
Captain, don't let it be.

347
00:32:32,513 --> 00:32:35,266
史波克先生，你联系星际舰队
Mr. Spock, you make the call to Starfleet.

348
00:32:46,193 --> 00:32:48,696
我命令你改变航线
I ordered you to change course.

349
00:32:59,915 --> 00:33:01,375
苏鲁先生...
Mr. Sulu...

350
00:33:01,542 --> 00:33:06,172
离控制器远点，如果你碰到它们，我们会被摧毁
Stay away from the controls. If you touch them, we'll be destroyed.

351
00:33:07,214 --> 00:33:10,259
苏鲁先生，那里什么都没有
Mr. Sulu, there's nothing there.

352
00:33:11,385 --> 00:33:14,430
舰长，我们为什么要打扰星际舰队？
Captain, why are we bothering Starfleet?

353
00:33:23,439 --> 00:33:27,568
- 这是命令  - 舰桥完全在控制中
- That was an order. - This bridge is under complete control.

354
00:33:27,735 --> 00:33:30,321
- 完全... - 没有必要
- Complete... - There is no need.

355
00:33:32,907 --> 00:33:35,910
看看你周围
Take a look around you.

356
00:34:08,609 --> 00:34:11,237
我不能服从你的命令，舰长
I cannot obey your order, Captain.

357
00:34:40,474 --> 00:34:44,019
把苏鲁先生带到他的宿舍，他被解除职务了
Take Mr. Sulu to his quarters. He's relieved of duty.

358
00:34:45,688 --> 00:34:48,691
[倒着说]
[TALKS BACKWARDS]

359
00:35:20,347 --> 00:35:22,433
你听到我说话了吗？
Did you hear me?

360
00:35:51,378 --> 00:35:54,506
舰长，我们必须从舰桥上下来
Captain, we must get off this bridge.

361
00:35:57,843 --> 00:36:00,888
我们必须...我正在失去指挥权
We must... I'm losing command.

362
00:36:02,014 --> 00:36:04,725
我正在失去指挥的能力
I'm losing my ability to command.

363
00:36:05,851 --> 00:36:08,187
我正在失去<i>企业号</i>
I'm losing the <i>Enterprise</i>.

364
00:36:11,023 --> 00:36:13,025
我正在失去指挥权
I'm losing command.

365
00:36:13,192 --> 00:36:15,361
我正在失去<i>企业号</i>
I'm losing the <i>Enterprise</i>.

366
00:36:15,527 --> 00:36:18,489
这艘船在不断航行
The ship is sailing on and on.

367
00:36:20,532 --> 00:36:22,868
我独自一人
I'm alone.

368
00:36:23,035 --> 00:36:25,120
独自
Alone.

369
00:36:26,288 --> 00:36:28,290
独自
Alone.

370
00:36:28,499 --> 00:36:31,710
- 我正在失去指挥权  - 舰长
- I'm losing command. - Captain.

371
00:36:31,877 --> 00:36:34,296
我失去了指挥权
I've lost command.

372
00:36:34,505 --> 00:36:36,632
我失去了<i>企业号</i>
I've lost the <i>Enterprise</i>.

373
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:43,597
吉姆...
Jim...

374
00:36:56,819 --> 00:36:58,821
我获得了指挥权
I've got command.

375
00:37:00,322 --> 00:37:02,408
我获得了指挥权
I've got command.

376
00:37:05,994 --> 00:37:09,581
- 我获得了指挥权  - 是的，舰长
- I've got command. - Correct, Captain.

377
00:37:18,674 --> 00:37:23,470
- 舰长，去哪里？  - 辅助控制，我的瓦肯朋友
- Where to, Captain? - Auxiliary control, my Vulcan friend.

378
00:37:23,637 --> 00:37:26,098
这艘船偏离了航向
This ship is off course.

379
00:37:30,519 --> 00:37:32,479
斯科提
Scotty.

380
00:37:32,646 --> 00:37:36,525
手动控制导航系统，绘制去星际基地4的航线
Override the navigation system and plot a course for Starbase 4.

381
00:37:36,692 --> 00:37:39,111
我做不到，先生
I can't do that, sir.

382
00:37:39,278 --> 00:37:42,322
- 为什么不行？  - 这些是灵敏的仪器
- Why not? - These are sensitive instruments.

383
00:37:42,489 --> 00:37:47,369
我不会让你破坏他们微妙的平衡，我们会迷路，永远迷路
I will not have you upset their delicate balance. We'd be lost, forever lost.

384
00:37:56,211 --> 00:38:00,215
现在走开，走开，否则我们会杀了你
Go away now. Go away or we'll kill you.

385
00:38:00,382 --> 00:38:01,675
斯科提...
Scotty...

386
00:38:01,842 --> 00:38:06,555
听我说，<i>企业号</i>已被外星生物入侵
Listen to me. The <i>Enterprise</i> has been invaded by alien beings.

387
00:38:06,722 --> 00:38:11,477
如果我们把它带到马科斯，数百万人将死亡，像在提拉库斯一样
If we take it to Marcos, millions will die the way they died at Triacus.

388
00:38:39,922 --> 00:38:45,594
不，我没事，史波克，我的野兽被消灭了，它不会回来了
No, I'm all right, Spock. My beast is finished. It won't return.

389
00:38:45,761 --> 00:38:50,516
只要孩子们在场，就会有危险，他们是载体
So long as the children are present, there is danger. They are the carriers.

390
00:38:50,682 --> 00:38:54,853
他们不是外星生物，他们是被误导的孩子
They're not the alien beings. They're children being misled.

391
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:58,941
他们是追随者，没有他们，邪恶就无法蔓延
They are followers. Without them, evil cannot spread.

392
00:38:59,107 --> 00:39:00,108
他们是孩子
They're children.

393
00:39:00,275 --> 00:39:04,279
<i>企业号</i>上的430名男女
430 men and women on the <i>Enterprise</i>

394
00:39:04,446 --> 00:39:09,451
和飞船本身都受到这些儿童的威胁
and the ship itself are endangered by these children.

395
00:39:11,537 --> 00:39:13,997
他们不知道自己在做什么坏事
They don't know the evil they're doing.

396
00:39:14,164 --> 00:39:15,916
也许这是真的
Perhaps that is true.

397
00:39:16,083 --> 00:39:19,628
但是他们内心的邪恶正在迅速蔓延
But the evil within them is spreading fast

398
00:39:19,795 --> 00:39:23,549
除非我们能找到一种方法来去除它...
and unless we can find a way to remove it...

399
00:39:23,715 --> 00:39:26,093
我们将不得不杀死他们
We'll have to kill them.

400
00:39:35,310 --> 00:39:37,312
- 柯克舰长？  - 这是什么？
- Captain Kirk? - What is it?

401
00:39:37,479 --> 00:39:41,191
我奉命逮捕你和史波克
I have been instructed to place you and Spock under arrest.

402
00:39:41,733 --> 00:39:45,279
- 根据谁的命令？  - 星际舰队司令部，长官
- By whose order? - Starfleet Command, sir.

403
00:39:45,445 --> 00:39:49,616
你从哪里听到的这个命令，少尉？
Where did you hear this order, Ensign?

404
00:39:55,497 --> 00:40:01,587
听我说，这个命令是假的，我希望你们回到你们的岗位
Listen to me. This order is false. I want you to return to your stations.

405
00:40:01,753 --> 00:40:06,842
很抱歉，但我必须坚持你和史波克和我一起去拘留区
Sorry, but I must insist you and Spock come with me to the detention section.

406
00:40:07,009 --> 00:40:09,219
少尉，听我说
Ensign, listen to me.

407
00:40:16,935 --> 00:40:21,732
不要强迫我杀了你，长官，如果有必要，我会的
Do not force me to kill you, sir. I will if I have to.

408
00:40:33,118 --> 00:40:37,789
- 你能安静地过来吗？  - 这个命令是假的，少尉
- Will you come peacefully? - This is a false order, Ensign.

409
00:40:37,956 --> 00:40:43,211
- 我从来没有违抗过命令  - 我知道
- I have never disobeyed an order. - I know that.

410
00:40:43,378 --> 00:40:47,215
- 但是船上有一个外星人  - 我不能违抗
- But there's an alien aboard the ship. - I cannot disobey.

411
00:40:47,382 --> 00:40:51,762
- 你要违抗这个命令！- 星际舰队取代你的命令
- You will disobey this order! - Starfleet supersedes your order.

412
00:41:12,074 --> 00:41:13,909
够了
Enough.

413
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:22,042
带这些人去拘禁，在舰桥上和我汇合
Take these men to detention and join me on the bridge.

414
00:41:40,435 --> 00:41:44,564
<i>企业号</i>永远不会到达马科斯十二号，它不会降落在那里
<i>Enterprise</i> will never reach Marcos XII. It will not land there.

415
00:41:44,731 --> 00:41:50,570
- 船员们会带我们去，他们相信  - 船员...不明白
- The crew will take us. They believe. - The crew... does not understand.

416
00:41:50,737 --> 00:41:54,199
当他们明白了，他们就不会带你去那里
When they understand, they won't take you there.

417
00:41:54,366 --> 00:41:57,703
- 他们会的！- 我们要去马科斯！
- They will! - We are going to Marcos!

418
00:41:57,869 --> 00:42:00,539
我们要去跟随我们的朋友
We're going to follow our friend.

419
00:42:01,873 --> 00:42:06,795
你们的朋友？那个偷渡者在哪里？他为什么躲起来？
Your friend? Where is that stowaway? Why does he hide?

420
00:42:06,962 --> 00:42:09,756
如果我们呼叫他，他会来的
He will come if we call him.

421
00:42:09,923 --> 00:42:13,301
我们不需要他，我们不怕你
We don't need him. We're not afraid of you.

422
00:42:13,468 --> 00:42:16,805
好，我很高兴你们不怕我
Good. I'm glad you're not afraid of me.

423
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:23,603
但你们的领导者害怕，他怕什么？
But your leader is afraid. What's he afraid of?

424
00:42:23,770 --> 00:42:26,815
- 他不怕任何人  - 或任何东西
- He's not afraid of anybody. - Or anything.

425
00:42:26,982 --> 00:42:28,734
他害怕被人看到
He's afraid to be seen.

426
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:30,861
当船员们看到和听到他时
And when the crew sees and hears him,

427
00:42:31,027 --> 00:42:35,240
他们会明白他不是他们的朋友，他们不会跟随他
they'll understand he is not their friend, and they won't follow him.

428
00:42:35,407 --> 00:42:39,911
- 他是我们的朋友  - 那就让他现身
- He is our friend. - Then let him show himself.

429
00:42:40,078 --> 00:42:43,290
让他出来，让他证明他是我的朋友
Bring him out. Let him prove that he is my friend

430
00:42:43,457 --> 00:42:47,169
我会...我会跟随他到宇宙的尽头
and I'll... I'll follow him to the end of the universe.

431
00:42:47,377 --> 00:42:48,837
不！
No!

432
00:42:53,383 --> 00:42:55,635
史波克先生，回放孩子们
Mr. Spock. Play back the chant

433
00:42:55,802 --> 00:42:58,680
为召唤戈尔甘而唱的圣歌
the children sang to summon up the Gorgan.

434
00:43:03,018 --> 00:43:06,188
<i>冰雹，冰雹，火和雪</i>
<i>Hail, hail, fire and snow,</i>

435
00:43:06,396 --> 00:43:09,858
<i>呼叫天使，我们要走了</i>
<i>call the angel, we will go,</i>

436
00:43:10,025 --> 00:43:13,653
<i>远远地，看到了</i>
<i>far away, for to see,</i>

437
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:17,157
<i>友好的天使来找我</i>
<i>friendly angel come to me.</i>

438
00:43:17,324 --> 00:43:21,203
<i>冰雹，冰雹，火和雪</i>
<i>Hail, hail, fire and snow,</i>

439
00:43:21,369 --> 00:43:24,539
<i>呼叫天使，我们要走了</i>
<i>call the angel, we will go,</i>

440
00:43:24,706 --> 00:43:28,126
<i>远远地，看到了</i>
<i>far away, for to see,</i>

441
00:43:28,293 --> 00:43:31,421
<i>友好的天使来找我</i>
<i>friendly angel come to me.</i>

442
00:43:47,437 --> 00:43:51,483
现在是看清世界本来面目的时候了
The time has come to see the world as it is.

443
00:43:52,025 --> 00:43:54,069
来吧
Come on.

444
00:43:58,073 --> 00:44:01,201
谁召见了我？
Who has summoned me?

445
00:44:01,368 --> 00:44:05,831
是我，戈尔根，我的野兽走了
I did, Gorgan. My beast has gone.

446
00:44:05,997 --> 00:44:10,252
它在现实的光芒下失去了力量，我又能指挥了
It lost its power in the light of reality. I command again.

447
00:44:10,460 --> 00:44:13,547
我在这里命令你
And I ordered you here.

448
00:44:13,713 --> 00:44:17,592
不，舰长，我在这里指挥
No, Captain. I command here.

449
00:44:17,759 --> 00:44:21,888
我的追随者是坚强、忠诚和顺从的
My followers are strong and faithful and obedient.

450
00:44:22,055 --> 00:44:26,351
这就是为什么我们无论走到哪里都会带走属于我们的东西
That's why we take what is ours wherever we go.

451
00:44:26,518 --> 00:44:28,895
你从那些不认识你的人那里拿走
You take from those who do not know you.

452
00:44:29,062 --> 00:44:31,398
而我们认识你
And we know you.

453
00:44:31,565 --> 00:44:35,777
- 那你知道我一定会赢  - 如果我们联合起来对抗你就不会
- Then you know I must win. - Not if we join together to fight you.

454
00:44:35,944 --> 00:44:39,072
愚蠢，你会被毁灭的
Foolish. You will be destroyed.

455
00:44:39,239 --> 00:44:42,909
我想请你加入我，但你很温柔
I would ask you to join me, but you are gentle.

456
00:44:43,076 --> 00:44:45,287
这是一个致命的弱点
And that is a grave weakness.

457
00:44:45,495 --> 00:44:50,458
- 我们也非常强大  - 力量被温柔抵消
- We are also very strong. - Strength is canceled by gentleness.

458
00:44:50,625 --> 00:44:54,796
你充满了善良，比如你不能被改变
You are full of goodness. Such as you cannot be changed.

459
00:44:54,963 --> 00:44:59,384
你就像父母们一样，你必须被消灭
You were like the parents. You must be eliminated.

460
00:45:03,138 --> 00:45:07,976
孩子们，我有你们在提拉库斯上的照片，你们想看看吗？
Children, I have pictures of you on Triacus. Would you like to see?

461
00:45:10,061 --> 00:45:12,647
史波克先生？图片呢？
Mr. Spock? The pictures?

462
00:45:12,814 --> 00:45:15,483
我禁止
I forbid it.

463
00:45:15,650 --> 00:45:18,778
- 你为什么要害怕它？  - 我没有害怕
- Why should you fear it? - I fear nothing.

464
00:45:18,945 --> 00:45:24,284
正如我们听说的，史波克先生，照片，孩子们在等着
So we were told. Mr. Spock, the pictures. The children are waiting.

465
00:46:36,231 --> 00:46:40,235
他们不会帮我们运送，他们反对我们
They would not help transport us. They were against us.

466
00:46:41,111 --> 00:46:43,405
他们必须被消灭
They had to be eliminated.

467
00:46:53,415 --> 00:46:57,210
汤米的父亲本来要毁灭你，但他为时已晚
Tommy's father would have destroyed you, but he was too late.

468
00:46:57,377 --> 00:47:02,757
你也来不及了，善良的人总是这样
You were also too late. The kind ones always are.

469
00:47:02,924 --> 00:47:06,094
并非总是如此，这次不是
Not always. Not this time.

470
00:47:06,261 --> 00:47:09,931
你不能隐瞒他们，他们就像我们一样能看到你
You can't hide from them. They see you as we see you.

471
00:47:10,140 --> 00:47:13,435
他们知道你是什么
They know what you are.

472
00:47:15,437 --> 00:47:19,024
- 孩子们也会学习  - 你们是我未来的将军
- Even the children learn. - You are my future generals.

473
00:47:19,190 --> 00:47:23,403
我们可以一起组建追随者大军，去你们的岗位上
Together we can raise armies of followers. Go to your posts.

474
00:47:23,570 --> 00:47:28,033
第一次伟大的胜利就在我们身上，你会看到的
The first great victories are upon us. You will see.

475
00:47:28,908 --> 00:47:32,704
我们在马科斯十二号上有数百万朋友
We have millions of friends on Marcos XIII.

476
00:47:32,871 --> 00:47:36,207
我们将消灭所有反对我们的人
We shall exterminate all who oppose us.

477
00:47:36,374 --> 00:47:40,378
我们的目标不能被那些不同意
Our purpose cannot be contaminated by those who disagree,

478
00:47:40,545 --> 00:47:43,131
不理解的人污染
who do not understand.

479
00:47:43,298 --> 00:47:47,093
- 他们必须被消灭  - 不要害怕
- They must be annihilated. - Don't be afraid.

480
00:47:47,260 --> 00:47:49,054
看看他
Look at him.

481
00:47:53,391 --> 00:47:56,478
没有你们这些孩子，他就什么都不是
Without you children, he's nothing.

482
00:47:58,271 --> 00:48:00,982
邪恶依然存在于他的内心
The evil remains within him.

483
00:48:02,942 --> 00:48:06,654
我命令你们！我命令你们！
I command you! I command you!

484
00:48:06,821 --> 00:48:12,827
去你们的岗位，履行你们的职责，否则我会摧毁你们
To your posts. Carry out your duties or I will destroy you.

485
00:48:12,994 --> 00:48:17,749
你将被扫到一边为强者让路
You will be swept aside to make way for the strong.

486
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:23,713
看看他到底有多丑，看着他，不要害怕
Look how ugly he really is. Look at him and don't be afraid.

487
00:48:25,340 --> 00:48:30,428
死亡，你们都去死，你们都去死
Death. Death to you all. Death to you all.

488
00:48:30,595 --> 00:48:33,807
你们都去死
Death to you all.

489
00:48:53,034 --> 00:48:55,703
没事了
It's all right.

490
00:48:55,870 --> 00:49:00,208
他们在哭，我不知道是怎么回事，但很乐意看到
They're crying. I don't know how it happened, but it's good to see.

491
00:49:02,210 --> 00:49:06,214
没事了，没事了，不是吗，医生？
It's all right. It's all right, isn't it, Doctor?

492
00:49:06,381 --> 00:49:09,175
是的，没事了
Yes, it's all right.

493
00:49:09,342 --> 00:49:11,386
我们现在可以帮助他们了
We can help them now.

494
00:49:18,643 --> 00:49:22,772
- 马科斯十二号就在前面，长官  - 调转航向，苏鲁先生
- Marcos XII dead ahead, sir. - Reverse course, Mr. Sulu.

495
00:49:34,868 --> 00:49:37,245
航线已调转，舰长

496
00:49:40,415 --> 00:49:43,918
