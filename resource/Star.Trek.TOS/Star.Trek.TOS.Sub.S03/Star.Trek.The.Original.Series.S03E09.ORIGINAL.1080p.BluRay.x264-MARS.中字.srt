<i>三周前消失得无影无踪</i>
<i>which vanished without trace three weeks ago.</i>

5
00:00:35,682 --> 00:00:38,643
<i>我们处于未经勘测的领域</i>
<i>We are in unsurveyed territory.</i>

6
00:00:39,811 --> 00:00:43,148
舰长，我们所有传感器的读数都非常奇怪
Captain, we are registering very curious readings from all sensors.

7
00:00:43,398 --> 00:00:44,816
- 具体说明  - 我不能
- Specify. - I cannot.

8
00:00:44,983 --> 00:00:48,945
根据我们的仪器，空间本身实际上正在分裂
According to our instruments, space itself is literally breaking up.

9
00:00:49,112 --> 00:00:52,699
没有已知的现象可以解释这些读数
There is no known phenomenon which would account for these readings.

10
00:00:52,907 --> 00:00:55,160
- 是不是传感器故障？  - 不是
- What about sensor failure? - Negative.

11
00:00:55,326 --> 00:00:58,329
- 我已经对所有系统进行了检查  - 斯科提：舰长
- I have run a check on all systems. - SCOTTY: Captain.

12
00:00:58,496 --> 00:01:01,207
- 我们正在失去引擎的动力  - 情况有多糟？
- We're losing power in the engines. - How bad is it?

13
00:01:01,416 --> 00:01:04,210
我们几乎读不到它，但我不喜欢它的样子
We can barely read it, but I don't like the looks of it,

14
00:01:04,419 --> 00:01:06,337
也找不到原因

17
00:01:22,353 --> 00:01:24,856

18
00:01:25,023 --> 00:01:28,568
- 说说  - 几乎没有传感器接触
- Explain. - There is virtually no sensor contact.

19
00:01:28,735 --> 00:01:31,529
没有质量分析，没有辐射痕迹

23
00:01:57,222 --> 00:01:59,724
- 接近传送范围  - 是，长官
- Close to transporter range. - Aye, aye, sir.

24
00:01:59,891 --> 00:02:01,893
上尉，打开呼叫频率
Lieutenant, open up a hailing frequency.

25
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:04,729
我一直在尝试与他们取得联系，长官，没有回应
I've been trying to raise them, sir. There is no response.

26
00:02:09,567 --> 00:02:14,530
- 正好在传送范围内，长官  - 好的，保持位置

00:02:14,697 --> 00:02:17,575
史波克先生，契科夫先生，跟我来

28
00:02:17,742 --> 00:02:20,203
麦考伊医生，立即到传送室报告

船还在运作，舰长
The ship is still functioning, captain.

42
00:05:28,057 --> 00:05:31,394
合理假设，叛变者在船上的某个地方
It is logical to assume the mutineers are somewhere aboard.

43
00:05:31,561 --> 00:05:33,479

奇怪，史波克先生，很奇怪
Odd, Mr. Spock. Very odd.

但是我知道它正在远离我们
but I know it's drifting away from us.

58
00:06:15,855 --> 00:06:18,316
我要修正范围吗，长官？
Shall I correct for range, sir?

59
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:23,112
是的，我觉得你是对的
Aye. I think you're right.

60
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:25,781
让我们保持在传送范围内，但不要太近
Keep us within beaming range, but not too close.

63
00:07:32,223 --> 00:07:33,307

All dead.

64

66
00:08:10,428 --> 00:08:13,931
老骨头，你能告诉我他们都是怎么死的吗？
Bones, can you tell me what they all died of?

67
00:08:14,098 --> 00:08:16,976
麦考伊[通过无线电]：<i>我说这些人是互相残杀的</i>
McCOY [OVER RADIO]: <i>I'd say these people killed each other.</i>

68
00:08:17,268 --> 00:08:18,269
他们什么？
They what?

69
00:08:18,436 --> 00:08:21,272
你没听错，吉姆，这些人互相残杀
You heard correctly, Jim. These people killed each other.

70
00:08:22,606 --> 00:08:27,153
精神疾病会感染所有船员吗？
Could mental disease have infected all of the crew?

71
00:08:27,403 --> 00:08:28,779
<i>根据飞船日志</i>
<i>According to the ship's log,</i>

72
00:08:28,946 --> 00:08:31,949
<i>这里的外科医生甚至不知道发生了什么</i>
<i>the medical surgeon down here didn't even know what was going on.</i>

73
00:08:32,116 --> 00:08:34,160
我尽可能收集所有数据
The best I can do is get all the readings I can get

74
00:08:34,368 --> 00:08:36,620
稍后分析它们
and analyze them later.

75
00:08:51,886 --> 00:08:53,763
什么鬼…？
What the devil...?

76
00:08:54,388 --> 00:08:56,140
柯克：<i>老骨头，是什么？</i>
KIRK: <i>Bones, what is it?</i>

00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:12,448
- 回答我  - 吉姆，这艘船正在解体
- Answer me. - Jim, this ship is dissolving.

80
00:09:12,615 --> 00:09:15,451
我的手刚刚穿过一个人和一张桌子
My hand just passed through a man and a table.

81
00:09:15,618 --> 00:09:17,703
立刻上来
Get back up here on the double.

82
00:09:20,664 --> 00:09:24,710
斯科特先生，<i>挑战号</i>开始消失了
Mr. Scott, the <i>Defiant</i>. It's starting to disappear.

SCOTTY [OVER RADIO]: <i>Bridge to transporter room.</i>

85
00:09:34,512 --> 00:09:36,180
<i>你修好传送装置了吗，先生？</i>
<i>You got that transporter working, mister?</i>

86
00:09:36,347 --> 00:09:37,431
不，长官，还没有
No, sir. Not yet.

87
00:09:38,808 --> 00:09:40,851
苏鲁先生，你接手，我去传送室
Take over, Mr. Sulu. I'll be in the transporter room.

88
00:09:41,018 --> 00:09:42,686
是，长官
Aye, aye, sir.

89
00:09:49,151 --> 00:09:52,321
船长，<i>挑战号</i>的传感器
Captain, the <i>Defiant</i>'s sensors correspond with an extremely

90
00:09:52,488 --> 00:09:54,949
与<i>企业号</i>的传感器具有极高的相关性
high degree of correlation to those of the <i>Enterprise</i>.

91
00:09:55,116 --> 00:09:56,534
你是说<i>挑战号</i>上发生的事
You mean what happened to the <i>Defiant</i>

92
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:58,202
<i>企业号</i>上可能也在发生？
might be happening to the <i>Enterprise</i>?

93
00:09:58,369 --> 00:09:59,870
是的
Affirmative.

94
00:10:00,871 --> 00:10:03,415
- 柯克呼叫<i>企业号</i>，斯科特先生  - 斯科提[通过无线电]：<i>我是斯科特</i>
- Kirk to <i>Enterprise</i>. Mr. Scott. SCOTTY [OVER RADIO]: <i>Scott here.</i>

95
00:10:03,582 --> 00:10:05,876
斯科特先生，准备传送我们回去
Mr. Scott, stand by to beam us back.

96
00:10:08,546 --> 00:10:12,508
- 我不能，长官，不能一次传送所有人  - 为什么不能？发生了什么？
- I can't, sir. At least not all at once. - Why not? What's happen--?

97
00:10:12,716 --> 00:10:14,885
一切，你所在的那艘船正在消失
Everything. That ship you're in is fading out

98
00:10:15,052 --> 00:10:18,597
它正在…它正在撕扯这艘船的内部结构
and it's-- Well, it's ripping the innards out of this one.

99
00:10:18,764 --> 00:10:20,558
<i>它干扰了我们的传送频率</i>
<i>It's jamming our transporter frequencies.</i>

100
00:10:20,724 --> 00:10:23,477
<i>只有其中三个在工作，并且我没有把握</i>
<i>I've only got three of them working, and I'm not sure of those.</i>

<i>你们中的一个人得等等</i>
<i>One of you has got to wait.</i>

契科夫，麦考伊，准备传送
Chekov, McCoy, prepare for transportation.

103
00:10:31,193 --> 00:10:32,236
你也是，史波克
You too, Spock.

104
00:10:32,403 --> 00:10:33,863
请求允许我留下，舰长
Request permission to remain, captain.

105
00:10:34,029 --> 00:10:36,407
- 我可以收集完整数据  - 拒绝请求
- I could be completing the data. - Request denied.

106
00:10:36,574 --> 00:10:38,075
舰长，有风险…
Captain, there is a chance--

107
00:10:38,242 --> 00:10:39,910
我知道有什么风险，史波克先生
I know what the chances are, Mr. Spock.

108
00:10:40,077 --> 00:10:42,913
不要争了，带着资料回去
Don't argue. Get back with the information.

109
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,082
我马上过去
I'll be right there.

110
00:10:48,252 --> 00:10:51,755
- 斯科提，启动传送装置  - 是
- Scotty, energize transporter. - Aye.

111
00:11:37,801 --> 00:11:38,844
史波克：传送
SPOCK: Energize.

112
00:12:19,969 --> 00:12:21,136
它消失了
It's gone.

113
00:12:22,596 --> 00:12:25,516
<i>挑战号</i>就这样消失了
The <i>Defiant</i> just vanished.

114
00:12:40,698 --> 00:12:42,533
有发现吗？
Anything?

115
00:12:44,368 --> 00:12:46,120
史波克：没有
SPOCK: Negative.

116
00:12:46,412 --> 00:12:48,205
就是这样，我已经尽力了
That's it. I've done all I can.

117
00:12:48,372 --> 00:12:51,166
外面没有什么可以抓住并带进来的
There's nothing out there to grab a hold of and bring in.

118
00:12:52,334 --> 00:12:54,753
那艘船走的时候，肯定带走了舰长
When that ship went, it must have taken the captain with it.

119
00:13:09,643 --> 00:13:11,395
女人的声音[在电脑上]：<i>电脑工作中</i>
WOMAN'S VOICE [ON COMPUTER]: <i>Computer working.</i>

120
00:13:11,562 --> 00:13:14,565
计算空间分裂间期的下一个周期
Compute the next period of spatial interphase.

121
00:13:14,732 --> 00:13:19,111
<i>距下一次分裂间期2小时12分钟</i>
<i>Next interphase two hours, 12 minutes.</i>

122
00:13:19,278 --> 00:13:21,739
2小时12分钟？
Two hours and 12 minutes?

123
00:13:21,905 --> 00:13:24,742
能量泄漏对船造成了损坏，她开始漂移了
That power leak has done damage to the ship, and she's starting to drift.

124
00:13:24,908 --> 00:13:26,368
我不能保持她在原地那么久
I can't hold her in place that long.

125
00:13:26,535 --> 00:13:30,039
我们必须试试，斯科特先生，这里的空间结构非常薄弱
We must try, Mr. Scott. The fabric of space is very weak here.

126
00:13:30,205 --> 00:13:34,752
如果我们干扰它，就没有机会救回舰长了
If we disturb it, there will be no chance of retrieving the captain alive.

127
00:13:34,918 --> 00:13:39,465
我不明白这个空间区域有什么特别之处
I don't understand what's so special about this region of space.

128
00:13:42,092 --> 00:13:44,428
可以这样想，契科夫先生
Picture it this way, Mr. Chekov.

129
00:13:44,595 --> 00:13:47,723
我们存在的宇宙与其他众多宇宙共存
We exist in a universe which coexists with a multitude of others

130
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:49,558
在同一个物理空间中
in the same physical space.

131
00:13:49,725 --> 00:13:51,393
在特定的短暂时间内
At certain brief periods of time,

132
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:54,772
他们的空间区域与我们的区域重叠
an area of their space overlaps an area of ours.

133
00:13:54,938 --> 00:13:56,815
那就是分裂间期的时间
That is the time of interphase,

134
00:13:56,982 --> 00:14:00,110
在此期间，我们可以和<i>挑战号</i>的宇宙联系
during which we can connect with the <i>Defiant</i>'s universe.

135
00:14:00,277 --> 00:14:01,612
史波克先生？
Mr. Spock?

136
00:14:02,696 --> 00:14:06,742
到时候我们就能找回舰长了，不是吗？
We will be able to retrieve the captain at that time, won't we?

137
00:14:06,909 --> 00:14:10,245
是的，然而，每个宇宙的维度结构
Yes. However, the dimensional structure of each universe

138
00:14:10,412 --> 00:14:14,166
完全不一样，任何能量的使用都会干扰它
is totally dissimilar. Any use of power disturbs it.

139
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:15,834
如果我们不是特别小心
If we are not extremely careful,

140
00:14:16,001 --> 00:14:19,296
我们将失去舰长，而我们自己也会被困住
we shall lose the captain and become trapped ourselves.

141
00:14:20,005 --> 00:14:23,133
- 我明白了  - 像他一样死去？
- I see. - And die like him?

142
00:14:23,342 --> 00:14:25,469
[尖叫和咕噜声]
[SCREAMING AND GRUNTING]

143
00:14:35,813 --> 00:14:37,022
契科夫
Chekov.

144
00:14:38,232 --> 00:14:41,026
- 契科夫！  - 啊！
- Chekov! - Aah!

145
00:14:43,654 --> 00:14:46,323
- 史波克：让警卫到舰桥  - 是，长官
- SPOCK: Security guards to the Bridge. - Aye, sir.

146
00:14:50,869 --> 00:14:53,163
发生什么事了，史波克先生？
What happened, Mr. Spock?

147
00:14:53,872 --> 00:14:56,834
在他攻击时，我正试图向契科夫先生解释
I was attempting to explain to Mr. Chekov

148
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,796
这种情况下我们问题的原理
the nature of our problems in this situation when he attacked.

149
00:15:01,004 --> 00:15:03,841
有没有人注意到在这之前他的行为有什么异常？
Did anyone notice anything peculiar in his behavior before this?

150
00:15:04,007 --> 00:15:06,718
我想他有几次疼痛痉挛
I think he had several spasms of pain.

151
00:15:06,885 --> 00:15:10,013
- 他似乎变得有些疯狂？  - 医生
- Did he seem to be getting hysterical? - Doctor,

152
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:12,766
他更像是愤怒而不是害怕
he seemed more angry than frightened.

153
00:15:12,975 --> 00:15:15,060
他没有理由愤怒
He had no cause to be angry.

154
00:15:15,269 --> 00:15:18,814
带契科夫先生去医务室，把他束缚起来
Take Mr. Chekov to Sickbay. Put him under restraint.

155
00:15:32,411 --> 00:15:37,040
乌胡拉上尉是对的，契科夫心中充满了杀人的愤怒
Lieutenant Uhura is correct. There was murderous fury in Chekov,

156
00:15:37,207 --> 00:15:41,003
同样的愤怒在<i>挑战号</i>上很明显
the same fury which was evident in the <i>Defiant</i>.

157
00:15:41,211 --> 00:15:42,504
那就是我害怕的
That's what I was afraid of.

158
00:15:42,671 --> 00:15:45,716
无论是什么驱使<i>挑战号</i>的船员互相残杀
Whatever it was that drove the crew of the <i>Defiant</i> to murder each other

159
00:15:45,883 --> 00:15:47,050
可能是有传染性的
could be communicable.

160
00:15:47,217 --> 00:15:50,220
你需要什么东西来找出原因？
Is there anything you need to isolate the cause?

161
00:15:50,596 --> 00:15:52,222
时间
Time.

162
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:56,602
哦，顺便说一下，史波克先生，我认为这可能是一个明智的预防措施
Oh, and by the way, Mr. Spock, I think it might be a wise precaution

163
00:15:56,810 --> 00:15:59,771
让我们与<i>挑战号</i>拉开一些距离
to put some distance between us and the <i>Defiant</i>.

164
00:15:59,938 --> 00:16:03,734
如果我们要找回舰长，我们不能动
If we are to recover the captain, we must not move.

165
00:16:03,942 --> 00:16:05,027
那需要多久？
How long will that take?

166
00:16:05,194 --> 00:16:08,030
大约两小时后才能进行尝试。
Approximately two hours before the attempt can be made.

167
00:16:09,406 --> 00:16:13,577
史波克，你确定吉姆还活着吗？
Spock, are you sure that Jim is still alive?

168
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:18,415
舰长在我们的传送光束内
The captain was caught in our transporter beam

169
00:16:18,582 --> 00:16:20,250
当<i>挑战号</i>逐渐消失时
when the <i>Defiant</i> phased out.

170
00:16:20,417 --> 00:16:24,755
他有可能幸免于跃迁的冲击并幸存下来
It is possible he was spared the shock of transition and survived.

171
00:16:24,922 --> 00:16:27,758
但是，如果我们要找回他
However, if we are to recover him,

172
00:16:27,925 --> 00:16:31,595
我们必须在下一次分裂间期的精确时刻抓住他
we must catch him at the precise moment during the next interphase,

173
00:16:31,762 --> 00:16:35,432
否则他会死，而且没有容错的余地
or he will die, and there can be no margin for error.

174
00:16:35,599 --> 00:16:37,976
他的环境装置能提供可呼吸的空气
His environmental unit can provide breathable air

175
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:40,729
不超过3.62小时
for no more than 3.62 hours.

176
00:16:42,564 --> 00:16:46,318
史波克先生，一艘船只在拦截航线上靠近
Mr. Spock. A vessel approaching on an intercept vector.

177
00:16:46,485 --> 00:16:49,780
- 状态，苏鲁先生  - 距离200,000公里
- Status, Mr. Sulu. - Range 200,000 kilometers.

178
00:16:49,947 --> 00:16:52,574
速度0.510
Velocity 0.510.

179
00:16:58,121 --> 00:17:01,124
- 乌乎拉中尉，发出红色警报  - 是的，长官，红色警报
- Lieutenant Uhura, signal red alert. - Aye, sir. Red alert.

180
00:17:01,291 --> 00:17:03,126
所有甲板进入红色警戒状态
All decks go to red alert.

181
00:17:03,293 --> 00:17:04,419

<i>安全确认，好的</i>
<i>Security confirmed. Will do.</i>

185
00:17:13,136 --> 00:17:17,641
他们完全停下了，长官，距离90,000公里并保持
They've stopped dead, sir. Range 90,000 kilometers and holding.

186
00:17:17,808 --> 00:17:20,143
史波克先生？我正在接收视觉信号
Mr. Spock? I'm receiving a visual signal.

187
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:21,979

188
00:17:22,145 --> 00:17:23,397
是的，长官
Aye, sir.

洛斯肯[通过显示器]：<i>我是指挥官洛斯肯</i>
LOSKENE [OVER MONITOR]: <i>I am Commander Loskene.</i>

190
00:17:33,991 --> 00:17:38,203
<i>你们正在入侵索利安联合体的附属领土</i>
<i>You are trespassing in a territorial annex of the Tholian Assembly.</i>

191
00:17:38,412 --> 00:17:40,998
<i>你们必须立即离开该区域</i>
<i>You must leave this area immediately.</i>

192
00:17:41,164 --> 00:17:45,002
史波克，指挥联邦星舰<i>企业号</i>	
Spock, in command of the Federation starship <i>Enterprise</i>.

193
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:49,006
指挥官，根据联邦记录，这个区域是自由空间
Commander, according to the Federation, this area is free space.

194
00:17:49,172 --> 00:17:52,009
<i>这是我们的领土，我们准备使用武力</i>
<i>We claim this territory and are prepared to use force,</i>

195
00:17:52,175 --> 00:17:55,220
<i>来保护我们的所有权，如有必要</i>
<i>if necessary, to protect our property.</i>

196
00:17:55,429 --> 00:17:57,848
史波克：我们对你们的武力展示不感兴趣
SPOCK: We are not interested in your display of force.

197
00:17:58,015 --> 00:18:01,351
<i>企业号</i>正在响应我们一艘船的求救信号
The <i>Enterprise</i> is responding to a distress signal from one of our ships

198
00:18:01,518 --> 00:18:04,313
目前正在从事救援行动
and is currently engaged in rescue operations.

199
00:18:04,479 --> 00:18:09,693
- 你想帮助我们吗？  - <i>我没有发现一艘残破的​​船的证据</i>
- Do you wish to assist us? - <i>I find no evidence of a disabled ship.</i>

200
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:14,323
<i>我的仪器表明我们是该区域仅有的两艘船</i>
<i>My instruments indicate that ours are the only two vessels in this area.</i>

201
00:18:14,489 --> 00:18:16,992
另一艘船在空间上被困住了
The other ship is interspatially trapped.

202
00:18:17,159 --> 00:18:20,537
它应该会在1小时53分钟后重新出现
It should reappear in one hour and 53 minutes.

203
00:18:20,704 --> 00:18:25,000
- 我们请求您在此之前等待  - <i>很好，</i>企业号
- We request you stand by until then. - <i>Very well,</i> Enterprise.

204
00:18:25,208 --> 00:18:27,044

<i>我们将等1小时53分钟</i>

<i>但要指出，我们不能容忍欺骗</i>
<i>But be correct. We do not tolerate deceit.</i>

207

如果我们能找到合适的过滤剂
If we could only find the proper filtering agent,

208
00:18:42,893 --> 00:18:45,354
我们或许可以解决这个问题
we might be able to solve this problem.

209
00:18:47,731 --> 00:18:50,692
不行，第三次失败了
Negative. It's the third failure.

210
00:18:52,569 --> 00:18:56,198
我告诉你，护士，拿这个样本进行分析

218
00:19:46,415 --> 00:19:47,916
锁定柯克舰长的坐标

柯克舰长不在他指定的坐标上，史波克先生
Captain Kirk is not on his designated coordinates, Mr. Spock.

传感器读数

00:20:18,196 --> 00:20:20,991
与我们上次看到<i>挑战号</i>时收到的读数不对应
to those we received the last time we saw the <i>Defiant</i>.

227
00:20:22,325 --> 00:20:26,997
有可能索利安人进入该区域扰乱了空间
It is possible the Tholian entry into the area has disturbed the space.

228
00:20:27,164 --> 00:20:29,833

Has the captain been beamed aboard yet?

232
00:20:35,338 --> 00:20:37,048
<i>没有，医生</i>
<i>Negative, doctor.</i>

233
00:20:37,215 --> 00:20:39,384
那么，分裂间期什么时候会发生？
Well, when is that interphase gonna happen?

234
00:20:39,593 --> 00:20:42,387
理论上，已经发生了，医生
Theoretically, it already has happened, doctor.

235
00:20:42,596 --> 00:20:45,390
<i>然而，船上的传感器并没有像预测的那样做出反应</i>
<i>However, the ship's sensors are not responding as predicted.</i>

You don't know whether you're gonna be able to recover the captain or not?

它们不会定期发生
They do not take place at regular intervals.

你等不及下一个了，我们还有一个像契科夫这样的案例
You can't wait for the next one. We've had another case like Chekov.

史波克先生，这种疾病不是由人传染的
The disease is not transmitted by the men, Mr. Spock.

247
00:21:18,006 --> 00:21:20,383
原因是我们所处的空间区域
The cause is the area of space we're in.

248

Mr. Sulu, divert all but emergency maintenance power to the shields.

262
00:22:02,425 --> 00:22:05,887

- Take the ship out of here. - Ready, Mr. Sulu?

275
00:22:39,462 --> 00:22:41,506
[机器哔哔声]
[MACHINES BEEPING]

276
00:22:41,715 --> 00:22:43,466
准备好了，史波克先生
Ready, Mr. Spock.

277
00:22:44,718 --> 00:22:46,344
发射
Fire.

278
00:22:51,766 --> 00:22:53,810
命中，史波克先生
A hit, Mr. Spock.

279
00:22:59,774 --> 00:23:02,485
轮机部，状态报告
Engineering, status report.

280
00:23:03,778 --> 00:23:04,821
- 斯科特先生？  - 斯科提：<i>史波克</i>
- Mr. Scott? - SCOTTY: <i>Spock,</i>

281
00:23:04,988 --> 00:23:07,991
<i>索利安人刚才的攻击烧毁了了我们的动力供应转换器</i>
<i>that hit we took from the Tholians has fused our power supply converters.</i>

282
00:23:08,658 --> 00:23:12,829
我现在对<i>企业号</i>无能为力，她一定会漂移
I can't do a thing with the <i>Enterprise</i> now. She's bound to drift.

283
00:23:12,996 --> 00:23:15,123
<i>也许就在外面那个门洞里</i>
<i>Maybe right through that doorway out there.</i>

284
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:18,126
你能估计维修所需的最短时间吗？
Can you estimate minimum time required for repair?

285
00:23:18,293 --> 00:23:20,045
我甚至不知道她是否能修好
I don't even know if she can be repaired.

286
00:23:20,795 --> 00:23:22,672
你满意了吗？
Are you satisfied?

287
00:23:25,175 --> 00:23:29,346
- 史波克，你为什么要这么做？  - 战斗的决定是合乎逻辑的
- Spock, why did you do it? - The decision to fight was logical.

288
00:23:29,512 --> 00:23:32,474
时间不够所以无法采取任何其他行动
Lack of time prevented any other course of action.

289
00:23:32,641 --> 00:23:34,893
索利安船必须被重创
The Tholian ship had to be disabled.

290
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:37,187
你应该知道会发生什么
You should have known what could have happened

291
00:23:37,354 --> 00:23:40,148
并竭尽全力保护你的船员
and done everything in your power to safeguard your crew.

292
00:23:40,315 --> 00:23:43,360
那是星舰舰长的标准，像吉姆
That is the mark of a starship captain. Like Jim.

293
00:23:43,526 --> 00:23:46,529
医生，我不认为现在是比较的时候
Doctor, I hardly believe this is the time for comparisons.

294
00:23:46,696 --> 00:23:48,239
请马上去你的实验室
Please go at once to your laboratory

295
00:23:48,406 --> 00:23:51,159
并寻找空间影响的解药
and search for an antidote to the effects of this space.

296
00:23:51,326 --> 00:23:54,162
那是你的首要任务，因为我们必须留在这里
That is your primary task, since we must remain here.

297
00:23:58,416 --> 00:24:01,336
史波克先生，有东西刚刚进入了传感器范围
Mr. Spock, something has just entered sensor range.

298
00:24:03,171 --> 00:24:04,464
是另一艘索利安飞船，长官
It's another Tholian, sir.

299
00:24:04,673 --> 00:24:07,175
当洛斯肯试图拦截我们时，他一定联系过他们
Loskene must have contacted them when he tried to intercept us.

300
00:24:07,342 --> 00:24:08,551
真有趣
Fascinating.

301
00:24:08,718 --> 00:24:10,679
先生，我要锁定剩余的相位炮能量吗？
Shall I lock in remaining phaser power, sir?

302
00:24:10,845 --> 00:24:11,888
不要，乌胡拉上尉
Negative. Lieutenant Uhura,

303
00:24:12,055 --> 00:24:13,973
你能呼叫靠近的船只吗？
can you open a channel to the approaching vessel?

304
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:15,725
他们拒接，长官，我不能…
They're refusing reception, sir. I can't--

305
00:24:15,892 --> 00:24:17,102
距离，苏鲁先生
Distance, Mr. Sulu.

306
00:24:17,310 --> 00:24:18,853
刚刚超出相位炮射程，长官
Just beyond phaser range, sir.

307
00:24:26,027 --> 00:24:27,195
那是什么？
What is that?

308
00:24:41,876 --> 00:24:45,213
苏鲁先生，我将对这些细丝进行分析
Mr. Sulu, I shall run an analysis on those filaments.

309
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:49,342
将所有传感器连接到船上图书馆的计算机控制台
Tie in all sensors to the ship's library's computer console.

310
00:24:52,345 --> 00:24:54,973
- 切换扫描器  - 是的先生
- Switch scanners. - Yes, sir.

311
00:25:01,271 --> 00:25:04,983
联邦技术中没有与此结构类似的
There is no analogue to this structure in Federation technology.

312
00:25:05,233 --> 00:25:08,987
不管怎样，它是一个能量场
It is, however, an energy field,

313
00:25:09,154 --> 00:25:11,614
如果索利安人成功地完成了这个结构
and if the Tholians are successful in completing this structure

314
00:25:11,781 --> 00:25:15,285
在我们完成维修之前
before we have completed our repairs,

315
00:25:15,618 --> 00:25:17,787
我们再也回不了家了
we shall not see home again.

316
00:25:50,987 --> 00:25:52,947
医生，你上次报告说没有
Doctor, your last report on an antidote

317
00:25:53,114 --> 00:25:55,158
这个空间的影响的解毒剂
on the effects of this space was negative.

318
00:25:55,325 --> 00:25:57,494
史波克先生，现在还是没有
It's still negative, Mr. Spock.

319
00:25:57,660 --> 00:26:01,539
锡拉根似乎是迄今为止测试过的最有希望的物质
Theragen seems to be the most promising substance tested so far.

320
00:26:01,706 --> 00:26:04,459
- 我们正取得进展 - 这有迫切性需要你
- We're progressing. - The urgency requires your attention

321
00:26:04,626 --> 00:26:06,628
把注意力放在实验室
in the laboratory.

322
00:26:07,045 --> 00:26:09,339
我的员工日以继夜地工作
My staff is working around the clock.

323
00:26:09,506 --> 00:26:14,177
我的在场不会影响任何测试的生物化学性质
My being there will not affect the biochemistry of any of the tests.

324
00:26:14,344 --> 00:26:19,057
史波克先生，这项事务需要我的个人的关注
This service requires my personal attention, Mr. Spock.

325
00:26:35,865 --> 00:26:41,996
几个小时前，舰长选择留在<i>挑战号</i>号上
A few hours ago, the captain elected to remain on board the <i>Defiant</i>

326
00:26:42,163 --> 00:26:44,207
所以他的三名船员
so that three members of his crew

327
00:26:44,374 --> 00:26:48,211
最有可能安全返回<i>企业号</i>
would have the best chance of returning safely to the <i>Enterprise</i>.

328
00:26:49,879 --> 00:26:52,549
他关心的不仅仅是他们
His concern was not only for them,

329
00:26:52,715 --> 00:26:56,719
而是这艘飞船的所有船员
but for all the members of the crew of this ship.

330
00:26:59,055 --> 00:27:01,891
你们都知道事件的后果
You all know the sequence of events.

331
00:27:02,058 --> 00:27:04,561
我们被索利安飞船攻击了
We were fired upon by the Tholian ship.

332
00:27:05,395 --> 00:27:10,191
那时，柯克舰长可能还活着
At that time, Captain Kirk may have been alive.

333
00:27:10,358 --> 00:27:13,903
我认为有必要反击
I deemed it necessary to return the Tholian fire

334
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:16,906
为了<i>企业号</i>的安全
for the safety of the <i>Enterprise</i>.

335
00:27:17,073 --> 00:27:20,285
索利安船已失去战斗力
The Tholian ship has been disabled,

336
00:27:20,868 --> 00:27:23,079
但作为战斗的结果
but as a result of the battle,

337
00:27:23,246 --> 00:27:29,752
我们必须接受柯克舰长已经不在人世的事实
we must accept the fact that Captain Kirk is no longer alive.

338
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:32,005
[尖叫]
[SCREAMING]

339
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:40,221
麦考伊：带他去病房，束缚住他
McCOY: Take him to Sickbay. Put him in restraints.

340
00:27:58,615 --> 00:28:02,785
我不会试图表达柯克船长要求的
I shall not attempt to voice the quality of respect and admiration

341
00:28:02,952 --> 00:28:05,455
那种尊重和钦佩的品质
which Captain Kirk commanded.

342
00:28:05,788 --> 00:28:12,420
你们每个人都必须私下想想评估这一损失
Each of you must evaluate the loss in the privacy of your own thoughts.

343
00:28:16,633 --> 00:28:18,301
立正
Attention.

344
00:28:27,143 --> 00:28:28,811
解散
Dismissed.

345
00:28:36,986 --> 00:28:39,489
舰长室里有一项职责
There is a duty to be performed in the captain's quarters

346
00:28:39,656 --> 00:28:41,991
需要我们去完成
which requires our presence.

347
00:28:43,159 --> 00:28:47,830
可以等一下，医生，我的职责要求我立即出现在舰桥上
It can wait, doctor. My duties require my immediate presence on the bridge.

348
00:28:47,997 --> 00:28:49,832
舰长留下了留言带
The captain left a message tape.

349
00:28:49,999 --> 00:28:52,502
他命令由我们两个一起听
It was his order that it be reviewed by both of us

350
00:28:52,669 --> 00:28:54,796
如果他被宣布死亡的话
should he ever be declared dead.

351
00:28:54,962 --> 00:28:57,173
你刚刚宣布吉姆死了
You have just declared Jim dead.

352
00:28:57,340 --> 00:28:59,842
等一个更合适的时刻，医生
It will wait for a more suitable moment, doctor.

353
00:29:00,009 --> 00:29:03,179
为什么？你害怕它会改变你现在的状态吗？
Why? Are you afraid it will change your present status?

354
00:29:04,681 --> 00:29:06,349
船员的身心状况
The mental and physical state of this crew

355
00:29:06,516 --> 00:29:08,351
是你的责任，医生
are your responsibility, doctor.

356
00:29:08,518 --> 00:29:10,812
目前，它们是您的首要任务
At the moment, they are your top priority.

357
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:13,564
舰长最后的命令是重中之重
The captain's last order is top priority,

358
00:29:13,731 --> 00:29:17,360
在你接手之前，你要遵守这个命令
and you will honor that order before you take over.

359
00:29:31,249 --> 00:29:33,209
麦考伊：从各个方面来说，他都是英雄
McCOY: He was a hero in every sense of the word,

360
00:29:33,376 --> 00:29:36,337
然而他的生命却白白牺牲了
yet his life was sacrificed for nothing.

361
00:29:36,504 --> 00:29:38,548
能让他的死变得有意义的
The one thing that would have given his death meaning

362
00:29:38,715 --> 00:29:40,007
是<i>企业号</i>的安全
is the safety of the <i>Enterprise</i>.

363
00:29:40,174 --> 00:29:41,718
现在你已经让它变得不可能了，史…
Now you've made that impossible, Mr. S--

364
00:29:41,884 --> 00:29:43,720
我们来这里有一个明确的目的，医生
We came here for a specific purpose, doctor.

365
00:29:43,886 --> 00:29:45,555
麦考伊：也许不是同一个
McCOY: Maybe not the same one.

366
00:29:46,556 --> 00:29:49,684
我真的来这里是为了找出你为什么留下来战斗
I really came here to find out why you stayed and fought.

367
00:29:50,184 --> 00:29:52,729
舰长会留下来找回一名船员
The captain would have remained to recover a member of the crew

368
00:29:52,895 --> 00:29:55,398
冒着自己的生命甚至船的危险
at the risk of his own life or even the ship.

369
00:29:55,565 --> 00:29:59,736
是的，他会的，史波克先生，但你没有做那个决定
Yes, he would, Mr. Spock, but you didn't have that decision to make.

370
00:29:59,902 --> 00:30:02,363
与索利安人战斗你有什么收获？
What did you have to gain by fighting the Tholians?

371
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:07,452
你本可以通过离开该区域来确保自己的舰长地位
You could have assured yourself of a captaincy by leaving the area,

372
00:30:07,744 --> 00:30:09,704
但你选择留下，为什么？
but you chose to stay. Why?

373
00:30:10,913 --> 00:30:15,084
我不需要向你或任何其他船员解释我的理由
I need not explain my rationale to you or to any other member of this crew.

374
00:30:15,585 --> 00:30:18,546
任何实验都有变化的幅度
There is a margin of variation in any experiment.

375
00:30:18,713 --> 00:30:20,089
虽然机会渺茫
While there was a chance,

376
00:30:20,256 --> 00:30:24,260
但我在法律和道德上都有义务确定船长的状态
I was bound legally and morally to ascertain the captain's status.

377
00:30:25,261 --> 00:30:27,305
你的意思是确定他是否死了
You mean to be sure if he was dead.

378
00:30:30,099 --> 00:30:33,102
- 嗯，你确定了这一点  - 够了，医生
- Well, you made certain of that. - That is enough, doctor.

379
00:30:33,269 --> 00:30:37,940
- 我们都有其他事情要做  - 是的，我有事要做
- We both have other things to do. - Yes, I have something to do.

380
00:30:39,442 --> 00:30:41,944
如果船员要活下来，我必须找到这个空间的解药
If this crew is to survive, I have to find an antidote

381
00:30:42,111 --> 00:30:44,238
你让我们困在其中
to this space you've locked us into.

382
00:30:44,405 --> 00:30:45,448
你将返回你的岗位
You'll return to your duty

383
00:30:45,615 --> 00:30:48,618
一旦我们履行了我们在这里的责任
as soon as we've discharged our responsibilities here.

384
00:30:48,785 --> 00:30:50,453
不着急，史波克先生
There's no hurry, Mr. Spock.

385
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:52,789
你可能不需要解药
The antidote probably doesn't concern you.

386
00:30:52,955 --> 00:30:56,125
瓦肯人可能是免疫的，所以慢慢来
Vulcans are probably immune, so just take your time.

387
00:31:02,131 --> 00:31:04,425
我必须承认我不了解你，史波克
I must admit I don't understand you, Spock,

388
00:31:04,592 --> 00:31:08,304
但我只是不敢相信你会想要吉姆的指挥权
but I just can't believe that you'd want Jim's command.

389
00:31:08,471 --> 00:31:10,640
你得知道如果你让我们脱离困境
You must know that if you get us out of this situation,

390
00:31:10,807 --> 00:31:12,183
他们会授予你勋章
they'll pin a medal on your chest

391
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:14,310
让你指挥<i>企业号</i>
and give you command of the <i>Enterprise</i>.

392
00:31:14,477 --> 00:31:18,147
医生，我在指挥<i>企业号</i>
Doctor, I am in command of the <i>Enterprise</i>.

393
00:31:21,818 --> 00:31:24,028
我想摆脱这个困境
I would like to remedy that situation.

394
00:31:29,742 --> 00:31:33,830
如果你认为我的行为不正常，那就解除我的职责
If you believe I have acted irregularly, then relieve me of duty.

395
00:31:33,996 --> 00:31:36,874
这是你作为这艘船的医务人员的特权
That is your prerogative as medical officer of this ship.

396
00:31:37,041 --> 00:31:39,210
柯克[录音]：<i>老骨头，史波克</i>
KIRK [ON TAPE]: <i>Bones, Spock,</i>

397
00:31:39,377 --> 00:31:42,171
<i>既然你在播放这盘磁带，我们就假设我已经死了</i>
<i>since you're playing this tape, we will assume that I am dead,</i>

398
00:31:42,839 --> 00:31:44,841
<i>战术形势危急</i>
<i>and the tactical situation is critical,</i>

399
00:31:45,007 --> 00:31:48,553
<i>你们俩都陷入了殊死搏斗</i>
<i>and both of you are locked in mortal combat.</i>

400
00:31:49,345 --> 00:31:51,514
<i>这意味着，斯波克，你控制着这艘船</i>
<i>It means, Spock, that you have control of the ship</i>

401
00:31:51,681 --> 00:31:55,017
<i>并且可能正在做出你职业生涯中最艰难的决定</i>
<i>and are probably making the most difficult decisions of your career.</i>

402
00:31:56,143 --> 00:32:00,690
<i>我只能提供一小点建议，不管它的价值如何</i>
<i>I can offer only one small piece of advice, for whatever it's worth.</i>

403
00:32:00,857 --> 00:32:05,903
<i>使用你的所有知识和逻辑来拯救这艘飞船</i>
<i>Use every scrap of knowledge and logic you have to save the ship,</i>

404
00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:10,157
<i>但是用直觉的洞察力来缓和你的判断</i>
<i>but temper your judgment with intuitive insight.</i>

405
00:32:11,367 --> 00:32:17,707
<i>我相信你有这些品质，但如果你在自己身上找不到</i>
<i>I believe you have those qualities, but if you can't find them in yourself,</i>

406
00:32:17,874 --> 00:32:19,876
<i>去找麦考伊</i>
<i>seek out McCoy.</i>

407
00:32:20,042 --> 00:32:25,715
<i>征求他的意见，如果你觉得它合理，就采纳</i>
<i>Ask his advice, and if you find it sound, take it.</i>

408
00:32:26,507 --> 00:32:32,346
<i>老骨头，你已经听到我刚刚告诉史波克的话了</i>
<i>Bones, you've heard what I've just told Spock.</i>

409
00:32:32,513 --> 00:32:34,390
<i>如果可以，请帮助他</i>
<i>Help him if you can,</i>

410
00:32:34,557 --> 00:32:36,434
<i>但记住他是舰长</i>
<i>but remember he is the captain.</i>

411
00:32:36,601 --> 00:32:39,395
<i>必须毫无疑问地遵循他的决定</i>
<i>His decisions must be followed without question.</i>

412
00:32:39,562 --> 00:32:45,192
<i>你可能会发现他有人类的洞察力也会犯人类错误</i>
<i>You might find that he is capable of human insight and human error.</i>

413
00:32:45,359 --> 00:32:48,070
<i>他们是最难掩饰的</i>
<i>They are most difficult to defend.</i>

414
00:32:48,237 --> 00:32:54,243
<i>但你会发现他值得同样的忠诚和信任</i>
<i>But you will find that he is deserving of the same loyalty and confidence</i>

415
00:32:54,452 --> 00:32:57,330
<i>就像你们给我的一样</i>
<i>each of you have given me.</i>

416
00:32:58,831 --> 00:33:00,708
<i>保重</i>
<i>Take care.</i>

417
00:33:17,224 --> 00:33:19,769
史波克，我，呃...
Spock, I, uh...

418
00:33:19,936 --> 00:33:21,771
抱歉
I'm sorry.

419
00:33:25,441 --> 00:33:27,944
它确实很伤人，不是吗？
It does hurt, doesn't it?

420
00:33:29,153 --> 00:33:31,948
你让我说什么，医生？
What would you have me say, doctor?

SCOTTY [OVER RADIO]: <i>Mr. Spock,</i>

424
00:33:43,084 --> 00:33:44,961
<i>我们有一个关于索利安牵引场的读数</i>

425
00:33:45,127 --> 00:33:47,964
<i>我想我们可以估算一下其大概完成时间</i>
<i>I think we can estimate its approximate completion time.</i>

426
00:33:48,130 --> 00:33:50,424
我很快就来
I shall be there shortly.

427
00:33:51,634 --> 00:33:55,805
医生，我相信我们每个人都有各自的任务要完成
Doctor, I believe we each have our respective tasks to complete

428
00:33:55,972 --> 00:33:59,141
在索利安人完成他们的任务之前

乌乎拉：史波克！史--

433

- 医生，我刚刚看见了舰长--  - 当然，乌乎拉
- Doctor, I have just seen Captain-- - Of course you have, Uhura.

434
00:35:09,253 --> 00:35:12,757
- 我们都很想见他  - 他活着，他还活着，医生
- We would all like to see him. - He's alive. He's alive, doctor.

435
00:35:13,549 --> 00:35:17,011
- 当然  - 相信我，我确实看见了他
- Of course. - Believe me. I did see him.

436
00:35:17,178 --> 00:35:21,432
我看见了，史波克！史波克先生！
I did. Spock! Mr. Spock!

437
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:25,061
- 我们去医务室  - 医生
- We're going to Sickbay. - Doctor.

438
00:35:25,227 --> 00:35:28,689
医生，我没有疯
Doctor, I'm not going mad.

439
00:35:28,856 --> 00:35:31,233
我确实看到了柯克舰长
I did see Captain Kirk.

440
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:36,363
我得去找史波克先生

443
00:36:15,736 --> 00:36:18,280
我是史波克，请说，斯科特先生
Spock here. Proceed, Mr. Scott.

444
00:36:18,447 --> 00:36:21,450
我们的一名船员刚刚发疯了，但我们已经控制住了他
One of our crewmen just went berserk, but we have him under control.

445
00:36:21,617 --> 00:36:26,622

447

- 麦考伊医生  - 是的，护士
- Dr. McCoy. - Yes, nurse.

448
00:36:46,684 --> 00:36:49,812
我对袭击斯科特轮机长的船员进行了诊断
I have a diagnosis of the crewman who attacked Engineer Scott.

449
00:36:49,979 --> 00:36:53,148
这绝对是由于间隙的恶化影响
It was definitely due to the deteriorative effects of interspace.

450
00:36:53,315 --> 00:36:56,652
是的，它开始在整艘船上普遍传播
Yes, it's beginning to spread generally throughout the ship.

451
00:36:56,819 --> 00:36:59,321
医生，我们有进展吗？
Are we any closer, doctor?

452
00:36:59,488 --> 00:37:03,659
不，除了我肯定它是一种锡拉根衍生物，这就是答案
No, except I'm positive that it's a theragen derivative that's the answer.

453
00:37:03,826 --> 00:37:05,995

Mr. Spock didn't believe me either, did he, doctor?

456
00:37:41,864 --> 00:37:44,867
好吧，除了你，没有人看到它，乌乎拉
Well, nobody saw it but you, Uhura.

457
00:37:46,118 --> 00:37:50,623
那么我没有真的看到他，是吗？
Then I didn't really see him, did I?

458
00:37:52,499 --> 00:37:53,792
我认为是的
I don't think so.

459
00:37:53,959 --> 00:37:55,920
[契科夫继续尖叫]
[CHEKOV CONTINUES SCREAMING]

460
00:38:00,883 --> 00:38:04,762
- 我会变得像契科夫一样吗，医生？  - 不
- Will I become like Chekov, doctor? - No.

461
00:38:04,929 --> 00:38:08,891
我们正在努力工作，我们会找到解药的
We're working hard. We'll find an antidote.

462
00:38:20,653 --> 00:38:24,073
- 我们开始进入分裂间期  - 我很好
- We're beginning to interphase. - I'm all right.

463
00:38:28,911 --> 00:38:29,954
斯科特呼叫舰桥
Scott to Bridge.

史波克[通过无线电]：<i>这里是舰桥，我是史波克</i>
SPOCK [OVER RADIO]: <i>Bridge. Spock here.</i>

465
00:38:31,789 --> 00:38:34,124
- 我们是否正在进入间隙？  - 不是
- Are we slipping into interspace? - Negative.

466
00:38:34,291 --> 00:38:38,087
我们目前相对稳定，你为什么要问？
We are relatively stable at the moment. Why do you ask?

467
00:38:47,096 --> 00:38:49,181
我不相信
I don't believe it.

468
00:38:52,768 --> 00:38:54,061
史波克：怎么了，斯科特先生？
SPOCK: <i>What is it, Mr. Scott?</i>

469
00:38:57,064 --> 00:38:58,607
斯科特先生？
Mr. Scott?

470
00:38:58,774 --> 00:39:02,194
史波克先生，我刚刚看到了柯克舰长
Mr. Spock, I've just seen Captain Kirk.

471
00:39:02,403 --> 00:39:07,908
他和我们一样站在那里，然后他就消失了
He was standing there just as plain as we are. And then he disappeared.

472
00:39:08,117 --> 00:39:10,452
立即向舰桥报告
Report to the bridge immediately.

473
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:13,789
这听起来像乌乎拉的故事，你认为这里面有什么真相吗？
That sounds like Uhura's story. You suppose there's any truth in it?

474
00:39:13,956 --> 00:39:17,960
在关键时刻，人有时会看到他们想看到的东西
In critical moments, men sometimes see exactly what they wish to see.

475
00:39:18,127 --> 00:39:19,461
你认为他们看到吉姆
Do you suppose they're seeing Jim

476
00:39:19,628 --> 00:39:21,296
是因为他们对你失去了信心吗？
because they've lost confidence in you?

477
00:39:22,965 --> 00:39:26,010
- 我只是在陈述一个事实，医生  - 麦考伊：它变得越来越危险
- I was merely stating a fact, doctor. - McCOY: It's getting critical.

478
00:39:26,218 --> 00:39:28,637
在下层甲板上发生了一些袭击事件
There have been a number of assaults down on the lower decks.

479
00:39:28,804 --> 00:39:30,305
甚至斯科提也受到了影响
Even Scotty's being affected.

480
00:39:30,472 --> 00:39:33,100
如果斯科提倒下，那是我们就没有任何机会
If Scotty goes under, that's the finish of whatever chance we have

481
00:39:33,267 --> 00:39:34,768
让<i>企业号</i>离开这里了
of getting the <i>Enterprise</i> out of here.

482
00:39:34,977 --> 00:39:36,854
麦考伊医生，请交给我
Please leave that to me, Dr. McCoy.

483
00:39:37,021 --> 00:39:38,856
我意识到船员是你最关心的问题
I realize that the crew are your prime concern.

484
00:39:39,023 --> 00:39:41,150
你在实验室对他们最好
You can best serve them in your laboratory.

485
00:39:41,316 --> 00:39:44,486
我要求你在找到补救措施前不要出来
I urge you to confine yourself to it until a remedy has been found.

00:39:44,653 --> 00:39:46,321
史波克！

487
00:39:51,994 --> 00:39:53,454
呵呵
Heh.

00:39:54,163 --> 00:39:57,875
一定是这个空间，它也影响到我了，我…
Must be this space. It's getting to me too. I...

我知道你什么都没做，史波克，我--对不起
I know it's nothing you've done, Spock. I-- I'm sorry.

490
00:40:03,505 --> 00:40:05,674
我明白，医生
I understand, doctor.

491
00:40:05,841 --> 00:40:10,679
我敢肯定，舰长会简单地说：“算了，老骨头，”
I'm sure the captain would simply have said, "Forget it, Bones."

492
00:40:20,147 --> 00:40:22,316
史波克先生，看
Mr. Spock, look.

493

496
00:41:37,891 --> 00:41:40,978
- 我没事吧，医生？  - 是的，乌乎拉，你很好
- Am I all right, doctor? - Yes, Uhura, you're fine.

497
00:41:41,770 --> 00:41:45,607
- 那我看到的…  - 是真的
- Then what I saw... - It was real.

498
00:41:45,774 --> 00:41:48,610
柯克舰长还活着？
Captain Kirk's alive?

499
00:41:48,777 --> 00:41:51,280
我们都看到了他，舰长还活着
We all saw him. The captain's still alive.

500
00:41:51,446 --> 00:41:52,948

我马上到
I'll be right there.

506
00:42:08,964 --> 00:42:11,174
你对那个相位炮的担忧是正确的
Then your fears about that phaser were correct.

507
00:42:11,383 --> 00:42:14,303
它在那疯狂的空间结构中炸出了一个洞
It blasted a hole right through that crazy space fabric,

只有天知道它把<i>挑战号</i>送到了哪里
and only heaven knows where it sent the <i>Defiant</i>.

509
00:42:17,472 --> 00:42:22,019
确实，但舰长留了下来，只有重叠时间发生了变化
Exactly. But the captain remained. Only the overlap time changed.

510
00:42:22,311 --> 00:42:28,025
下一次分裂间期将发生在这里，你能做好准备吗？
The next interphase will occur here. Can you be ready?

511
00:42:29,318 --> 00:42:32,654
那大约20分钟，是的，她会再回来的
That will be about 20 minutes. Aye, she'll be back together.

512
00:42:32,821 --> 00:42:34,823

But we'll only have about 80 percent power built up.

513
00:42:34,990 --> 00:42:36,491

为了你和船员的健康
To your good health and the health of the crew.

518
00:42:50,005 --> 00:42:51,715
你找到解药了，医生
You've found the antidote, doctor.

519
00:42:51,924 --> 00:42:54,051
是的，我已经让船上的每个人
Yes, and I've ordered it orally or intravenously

520
00:42:54,217 --> 00:42:55,969
口服或静脉注射了
for everyone aboard the ship.

521

我想请先生们喝下它
I would like for you gentlemen to drink it down.

522
00:43:01,016 --> 00:43:04,353
契科夫少尉很早就受到了影响，这对他有作用吗？
Ensign Chekov was affected so early. Has he responded to it?

523
00:43:04,519 --> 00:43:07,898
他又是笑呵呵的样子了，我已经让他离开了病房
He is his smiling self again, and I've discharged him from Sickbay.

524
00:43:08,065 --> 00:43:11,401
- 斯科提：这是什么？  - 它是一种稀释的锡拉根衍生物
- SCOTTY: What is it? - It's a diluted theragen derivative.

525
00:43:11,568 --> 00:43:14,655
锡拉根？克林贡人使用的一种神经毒气
Theragen? A nerve gas used by the Klingons.

526
00:43:14,821 --> 00:43:16,323
是的，也是致命的
Aye, and deadly too.

527
00:43:16,490 --> 00:43:18,659
你在想什么？你想杀了我们所有人
What are you thinking of? You're trying to kill us all.

528
00:43:19,034 --> 00:43:20,911
如果我没记错的话，它会造成死亡
If I remember correctly, it caused fatality

529
00:43:21,078 --> 00:43:22,704
只有在以纯净方式使用时
only when used in pure form.

530
00:43:22,871 --> 00:43:26,041
没错，在这个衍生物中，混合了酒精
That's right, and in this derivative, mixed with alcohol,

531
00:43:26,208 --> 00:43:29,044
它只是抑制大脑的某些神经输入
it merely deadens certain nerve inputs to the brain.

532
00:43:29,211 --> 00:43:32,547
哦，好吧，任何像样的苏格兰威士忌都能做到
Oh, well, any decent brand of Scotch will do that.

533
00:43:32,714 --> 00:43:36,885
唔，一大口这个，你可以用相位枪击晕一个人
Mm. One good slug of this and you could hit a man with phaser stun

534
00:43:37,052 --> 00:43:40,514
而他永远不会感觉到，甚至不知道
and he'd never feel it or even know it.

535
00:43:45,018 --> 00:43:46,937
它与苏格兰威士忌搭配得很好吗？
Does it make a good mix with Scotch?

536
00:43:47,104 --> 00:43:48,897
是的
It should.

537
00:43:49,106 --> 00:43:51,566
我会告诉你的
I'll let you know.

538
00:43:57,739 --> 00:44:02,285
喝下去，史波克，这是人类该做的事
Drink it down, Spock. It's the human thing to do.

00:45:40,342 --> 00:45:41,843
我们现在在哪里，史波克先生？
Where are we now, Mr. Spock?

565
00:45:51,353 --> 00:45:53,855
舰长，我们已经摧毁了索利安人的网

00:45:54,022 --> 00:45:57,734
没有，少尉，我们利用飞船的动力摆脱了它

远离我们之前的位置

好的，因为舰长被锁在我们的传送光束里

573
00:46:13,416 --> 00:46:15,377
当我们被甩出分裂间期区域时

574

他应该和我们一起被拉到这里来了

- 史波克呼叫传送室  - 我是麦考伊

在<i>挑战号</i>被扔出后，我拥有了一个属于自己的整个宇宙
I had a whole universe to myself after the <i>Defiant</i> was thrown out.

588
00:47:42,797 --> 00:47:46,134
里面绝对没有其他人

589
00:47:46,301 --> 00:47:50,639
我必须说，我更喜欢拥挤的宇宙
I must say, I prefer a crowded universe much better.

590
00:47:50,805 --> 00:47:52,766
没有我你们两个怎么和谐相处的？
How did you two get along without me?

591
00:47:52,933 --> 00:47:54,476
哦，我们将就了一下，呃...

史波克先生下达了命令，我找到了答案
Mr. Spock gave the orders, and I found the answers.

- Good. No problems between you? - None worth reporting, captain.

594
00:48:02,817 --> 00:48:04,819
- 说来听听  - 史波克：唔
- Try me. - SPOCK: Hmm.

595
00:48:04,986 --> 00:48:10,325
当人类参与时，这种轻微的干扰是不可避免的
Only such minor disturbances as are inevitable when humans are involved.

596
00:48:10,492 --> 00:48:12,327
哪些人类，史波克先生？
Which humans, Mr. Spock?

597
00:48:12,494 --> 00:48:15,997
他的意思是，当人类和瓦肯人走得很近时，吉姆
He means that when humans become involved with Vulcans, Jim.

598
00:48:16,831 --> 00:48:19,167
没错，我明白
Ah, yes. I understand.

599
00:48:21,294 --> 00:48:24,214
我希望我最后的命令有助于解决
I hope my last orders were helpful in solving any problems

600
00:48:24,381 --> 00:48:26,007
你认为不值得报告的任何问题
that you don't feel worth reporting.

601
00:48:28,343 --> 00:48:30,178
命令，舰长？
Orders, captain?

602
00:48:30,345 --> 00:48:32,055
你指的是什么命令，吉姆？
What orders are you referring to, Jim?

00:48:32,263 --> 00:48:33,682
我最后的命令
My last orders.

604
00:48:33,848 --> 00:48:37,018
我留给老-- 给你们俩的最后的命令
The last orders that I left for b-- For both of you.

605
00:48:40,146 --> 00:48:42,857
- 最后录制的命令  - 哦，那些命令
- The last taped orders. - Oh, those orders.

606
00:48:43,024 --> 00:48:44,234
嗯，时间不够
Well, there wasn't time.

607
00:48:44,401 --> 00:48:46,027
我们没能有机会听
We never had a chance to listen to them.

608
00:48:47,195 --> 00:48:49,030
史波克：没听，你看，危机降临到我们身上
SPOCK: No, you see, the crisis was upon us

609
00:48:49,197 --> 00:48:52,283
然后很快就过去了，舰长，我们，呃…
and then passed so quickly, captain, that we, eh...

610
00:48:53,284 --> 00:48:55,662
好的，好的
Good. Good.

611
00:48:55,829 --> 00:48:59,374
好吧，我希望我们不会有类似的机会
Well, I hope we won't have similar opportunities

612
00:48:59,541 --> 00:49:03,878
测试那些你们从来没听过的命令
to test those orders, which you never heard.

613

- 前进，曲速2，苏鲁先生  - 曲速2，长官
- Ahead warp factor 2, Mr. Sulu. - Warp factor 2, sir.
